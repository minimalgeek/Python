And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Amar. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Dave. We rounded out a fantastic year with strong fourth quarter results. New model ARR grew 109% at constant currency. New model subscriptions grew by a record 227,000 sequentially. Recurring revenue jumped to 84% of total revenue and we are beginning to see meaningful volume in our cloud services. It's clear that we are making real progress in our two major initiatives, growing lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and increasing adoption of our cloud-based solutions. Let's dive into the numbers a little more. For the quarter, we added 154,000 net subscriptions bringing the total additions for the year to 530,000. Total subscriptions at the end of the year stood at 3.11 million, an increase of 21%. We are really pleased with the continued momentum of new model subscription additions, which grew more than 3.5 times as compared to Q4 of last year. Bear in mind, we accomplished this without having a significant promotion in the market during Q4, so we are really pleased with the overall demand for product subscriptions. Taking a closer look at new models subscription, once again product subscriptions drove the majority of the new model sub-addition as will likely be the case in most quarters. New customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter, which is a consistent trend we've been seeing. These new customers come from mix of market expansion, growth in emerging countries, former pirates and people who may have been using an alternate design or simulation tool. It's clear that a subscription model is broadening our market opportunity. We are experiencing continued success with the EBA program in our enterprise named accounts. EBA subscription additions more than doubled over Q4 last year and total EBA subs grew over 40% for the year. Q4 has always been our biggest quarter for signing large transactions with our enterprise customers and this quarter was no exception. We signed nearly 70 deals worth more than $1 million and over 50 of these were EBAs. The EBA deal volume was up 50% over Q4 of last year and this is a clear sign that we are successfully and effectively moving our biggest customers to the new model. It's important to remember that these EBAs help drive subscription growth going forward. Since we introduced EBAs customer that are moved from our older license agreement to the token-based EBA have resulted in subscriptions nearly three times higher than before. Keep in mind, that most of the EBAs we signed up in Q4, won't start contributing to the subs account under Q1 of this year consistent with prior years. Our product subscriptions in EBA subscriptions are the business model transition part of our story. The third component of our new model subscription is our cloud products. This is a TAM expansion part of our transition and we continue to build on our leadership in the cloud. We had a record quarter for the cloud, adding three times more cloud subscriptions than in any other quarter in our history. Cloud subscription was driven by BIM 360. Our BIM management and collaboration tool closely followed by Fusion, our cloud-based designs, simulation, and fabrication tool. For the year, cloud subscriptions grew more than 150%. BIM 360 continues to gain momentum with big wins at large construction companies. A perfect example of this is a multi-million dollar Q4 deal with a large U.S. based contractor. Historically, this customer had been a relatively minor user of some of our design tools like Revit, AutoCAD and Navisworks. Over the past couple of years, they've been expanding the deployment and utilization of BIM 360 and their new contract covers an 8,000 subscription mix of BIM 360, Field, Glue and Docs to be used in 95% of their projects. More than anything else this transaction illustrates strengthening alignment with builders and contractors enabling us to reach parts of the $10 trillion construction market like never before. I also want to note that in Q4, we launched Fusion Ultimate which provides enterprise level customers access to advanced design, simulation and manufacturing capabilities. The list price for an annual subscription to Fusion Ultimate is $1500 which includes consumption credits and this provides us with new opportunities to continue to introduce cutting edge products to our customers, now partly offsetting the growth in new model subscriptions with the expected decline in maintenance subscription. The fourth quarter has long had the biggest pool of renewal opportunities, so with the maintenance renewal rates similar to our recent trends and no new maintenance agreements being sold, the sequential step up in attrition was as expected. As we said in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance subscriptions going forward. Now the rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and our ability to incent maintenance customers to switch over to EBAs or to products subscription. And that's a perfect segway for me to turn things over to Andrew to talk about ARR and ARPS. Importantly, Andrew will also cover our new program to incent those maintenance customers to move to subscription. Andrew? Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Amar. When we started the business model transition, we indicated the subscription growth was a key metric for tracking our progress. Clearly we feel good about the trends we are seeing with subscription, but ultimately if the growth in ARR that will enable us to achieve our free cash flow goals. So we are happy to report the trends we are seeing in both are positive. New model ARR growth surged to 109% on a constant currency basis and reflects the continued strong uptake of all of our new model subscription offerings. The total ARR grew 19% of constant currency and about one-third of our total ARR is now driven by new model subscription. That's up from just 19% in Q4 of last year and it's a clear indicator of significant progress we’ve made this year. You might also recall at the Investor Day, I said that we would start to see ARPS trending up in the second half of the FY2018. In Q4 2017, we did experience a sequential increase in ARPS, but this does not indicate a permanent trend or an inflection point. As you recall in Q1 and Q3 we had a successful legacy promo which brought in a lot of subscriptions at lower ARPS. We did not run a promo in Q4 and that positively impacted ARPS. Going forward, the ARPS calculation will continue to be extremely sensitive to short-term shifts and term length, geo mix, promotions et cetera. We expect to see ARPS walk up or down on a quarterly basis and it will not increase monotonically throughout the year. Now I want to pick up where Amar left off regarding our maintenance subscription base and build on my comments from Investor Day. At the end of Q4, we had just over 2 million maintenance subscriptions. Starting today we are starting taking a number of steps to encourage these customers to move the product subscription and to do so sooner rather than later. We want the best for these customers and product subscription provide them the greatest value and access to our offerings. So let me get into the information that you've been asking for since we talked about this in Investor Day. Information we just communicated to our customers and channel partners this morning. Beginning in June, maintenance customers can move to product subscription for a loyalty discount of 60% less than the cost of a new product subscription. This discount will decrease by 5% for each of the following two years, so the earlier the customer switches the more they'll safe. This discount allows the maintenance customers to move to subscription at a 5% increase over their current price and lock that price in for three years in exchange for turning in their perpetual license. A maintenance customer can choose the stay on maintenance, but they will be subject to a 5% increase this year, a 10% increase in FY2019 and a 20% increase in FY2020. In addition, maintenance customers will no longer be able to purchase multi-year contracts. So why these customers going to move, product subscription offers the greatest value to our customers that provide increased flexibility, support and access to our cloud products and the loyalty pricing will be a big driver. This program wins all the right elements, a customer friendly element with the loyalty price and the pressure driver of the maintenance price increases. It's a simple program, partners know how to run it, the sales force knows how to run it, and they're highly motivated to do it well. Beyond that, the program offers our customers the most attractive pricing for moving to collections they will ever see and we expect many customers to move their standalone maintenance fees to collections. And it also important to remember that the maintenance customer will be subject to a 5% increase this year whether they take advantage of the loyalty pricing and move to product subscription or if they stick with their traditional maintenance. This migration will be good for both Autodesk and our customers as it moves into the newest and best product experience. Now, I'll turn it over to Scott for a closer look at some of the financials. Scott Herren Thanks Andrew. All of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details. So I'm not going to walk through them all, but I do want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items and talk about our business outlook for fiscal 2018. Starting with revenue total direct revenue for the fourth quarter increased once again and represented 32% of total revenues. That's up from 23% in Q4 last year and just 19% two years ago. That's a lot of progress over a relatively short period of time as we continue to grow the volume of business with both our large enterprise customers as well as on our e-store. As we indicated we believe there is still room for our direct business to grow over the next few years as we progress on the model transition. Moving to spend management, we're really proud of what we've accomplished on the expense side. We started the year with a goal of keeping non-GAAP spend flat to down 1% we ended up reducing it by 3% for the fiscal year and 4% in the fourth quarter. We accomplish this by making sure we're investing in critical elements of our transition by reducing standard other areas. Part of the reduction this year was the result of the restructuring we announced at the beginning of the year, coupled with a relentless focus on driving efficiencies across the organization. We significantly reduced our M&A activity this year and we've been simplifying the product portfolio. We remain committed to keeping spend flat through fiscal 2019 and believe that we can do so without compromising the long-term health of the company. During this stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue. Total deferred revenue grew 18% against the tough compare last year when we attached very high percentage of maintenance contracts along with the last sale of perpetual licenses for individual products. As I mentioned in December, the work we've been doing over the past several quarters on our operating structure has allowed us to move about $1.7 billion of our offshore cash into foreign subsidiaries that are branches of Autodesk U.S. If we look at our cash balance at quarter end approximately 85% can be used without incremental U.S. tax that equates to $1.9 billion. Of course we need to keep some of our cash for operating needs but we intend to put the majority of it into our stock buyback program and execute on that over the next several quarters using both programmatic and opportunistic means. We've been increasing our buyback this year and in Q4 we repurchased 2.9 million shares. For the year we repurchased nearly10 million shares resulting in a reduction of over 4 million. We're making steady progress on this front and over the past two years of reduced our basic share count by about 3%. Overall we're extremely pleased with our Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 results. We have increased confidence of the transition is working for our customers, for our partners and for Autodesk and they were on track for the fiscal 2020 targets we set. I turn now to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well, but many of the emerging markets have been challenging. We continue to monitor for changes in Europe stemming from Brexit, but today we have not experienced any impact. With the new administration in the U.S. it's far too early to determine any impact from proposed policy changes around tax reform, trade in tariffs, infrastructure spend or whatever the next executive order might be. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018, it will be our first full-year in the subscription only model and as such we believe it's prudent to take an appropriately conservative approach to our outlook for the year, while remaining confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets. Here our primary financial goals were resetting for fiscal 2018. We're projecting the total ARR growth will increase to between 24% and 26%. Subscription additions are projected to increase by 600,000 to 650,000, which equates to about a 20% increase. Bear in mind, that the sales team focus that goes into the maintenance to subscription program Andrew discussed earlier will drive higher lifetime values from those who convert, but will not drive any additional subscription adds. Spending will be about flat and we expect the percentage of recurring revenue to increase to approximately 90% beginning in Q1. As we look at our outlook for Q1, keep in mind that total ARR growth and subscription additions will build over the course of the year. Another item that I mentioned in December is that we are working to further improve the transparency of our revenue reporting. As such starting in the first quarter, we are planning to have three revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance, and one for other revenue. In this format, all new model subscription revenue will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be reported in the maintenance line, any remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as other revenue. To alleviate the need for the recon table, we've been including in prepared remarks and should significantly improve the link between our financials and our business model transition. In this format, subscription revenue times four will equal new model AAR, maintenance revenue times four will equal maintenance ARR, and you'll be able to better isolate the non-recurring revenues that flow into the other revenue lines. One side effect of this change to call out is that a changes the impact to our ARR calculation to include a couple of small legacy products. We apply this methodology to our fiscal 2017 results, our total ARR would have been about $40 million higher. We have factored this change into our guidance assumptions for fiscal 2018, so that we are comparing apples-to-apples. And we will give you visibility to all of fiscal 2017 with the small tweak. To wrap things up, we've executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on the success as we head into fiscal 2018 and the next stage of our transition. I want to thank our employees and partners who have worked so hard to make last year a success. I also want to recognize Carl Bass for his leadership and tireless service to Autodesk over the past 20 plus years, and we look forward to his continued input as the special advisor over the next few months and an ongoing board member. As we undergo the CEO transition, both Andrew and Amar have our full confidence to lead the Company to continued success. Operator, we’d now like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just first to start with, Andrew, Andrew, you kind of talked about some of the changes that you're making to maintenance pricing and new model to incentive that conversion. Could you quickly recap the promotion that you're specifically running on product subscription if they trade in their perpetual license? And more broadly, how are you thinking about the maintenance subs to new model subs conversion in 2018? Andrew Anagnost Yes, all right. So let me just recap some basic details you’re seeing, you get the understanding. So the way this works is the customer in return for trading in a perpetual license gets a very big discount to move to subscription, essentially what they're doing is they're paying 5% more than they would pay today on their current maintenance, if they were going right now from today. So they get to move over at that price and they get to lock that price in for three years. So if they move early, they get much more advantage then if they wait. Now one of the things that's important about this program and things we're looking at, we want to move is many of these maintenance customers as possible, really we want to move 100%. Churn is the enemy of this program. So the reason we structured at the way we have with these 5% increases in this discount to move is because we want 100% of them to move. And the advantages we're going to get out of this is to look as they move, they're going to be making different kinds of choices. A lot of them are going to have the best possible price to get to collection that they've ever seen. So what we're going to see instead of a customer moving from maintenance, on AutoCAD to subscription on AutoCAD, they're going to move from AutoCAD maintenance to collection subscription, which by the way has a greater uplift on top of the maintenance base and than just what we're doing. In addition some of the customers are going to stay behind on maintenance. This is just going to be their preferred path. They're going to stay there till the second year of the program and maybe not move until the third year of the program. So they're obviously going to see continual price increases to maintain that perpetual license, but it’s important to them, they're going to end up paying more. But the net result of what we're trying to do is over a three-year period move the majority of that base over. I'm not going to give you specifics about how many we expect to move over this year, but we certainly expect people to start considering this program and we expect to see a lot of our larger customers at the top of the pyramid and down at the bottom where they get a lot of engagement from partners moving quickly. Saket Kalia Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up, actually for you again, Andrew, I just want to confirm, I think you mentioned that new model ARPS of course was up this quarter but could flux quarter to quarter. I may have missed it but can you just confirm, it sounded like it should be roughly flat from a dollar perspective throughout 2018. Is that correct? Andrew Anagnost So if you remember what I said at Investor Day earlier, it's going to start to trend up in the second half of the year. The increase we saw in Q4 is basically a result of the fact that we didn't have a promo in Q4 and we had one in Q3. So you're not going to see that continue, you are going to see some kind of variability as we head through Q1, Q2 and Q3, but as we move into the second half it's not going to be flat, it's actually going to trend up in the latter half of the year. And that's just going to be a result of the accumulation of new model ARPS that we're going to be seeing especially on the products subside and the mix of more mature markets buying product set. Saket Kalia That's very helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost You're welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color. I remember at the Investor Day and I apologize if you touched on this in earlier comments President if you could give us a little bit more color about the mix of the cloud subs versus the new – versus the desktop subscriptions and let us know, one, kind of where are you seeing strength in that and how do you – how are you thinking about splitting that out going forward they terms of disclosure? Amarpreet Hanspal Well, Heather, let me take the first part of that question and then Scott can weigh in on the disclosure parts. We saw strength across the board on all types of subscriptions and clearly product descriptions are very strong and we saw EBA’s as I mentioned in the earlier remarks. We had lots of strength in the EBA. We had a record quarter in the cloud because I think it was three times the number of subscriptions that you assume in any prior quarter, so we are definitely seeing a lot of growth from our new cloud-based offerings, but we have continued strength in product subscriptions across the board and we expect that momentum to be carried into this fiscal year. Scott Herren Yes. And Heather within that the strength comes from BIM 360 largely followed by Fusion and then shotgun .  So it was a very strong quarter, it's good to see the cloud products which will be key to kind of the second wave of the transition that the cloud products begin to take off. In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's – we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out. Heather Bellini Okay. And then just one quick follow-up if you don't mind. In regards to the changes that you sent out to the channel partners today, what's been – have you heard any – I imagine you kind of tested the waters on this of before you did it. What type of feedback did you get from customers or from channel partners about the strategy to basically main thence customers paying that increase in price and the move to subscription, basically trading they your license to move to subscription, what type of feedback did you hear if you ran that by any of your larger customers before you did this in? Andrew Anagnost So Heather we do test a lot of these things. Amar and I just got back from our sales conference and I think the most relevant feedback I can give you is that our partners are very, very positive about this program mostly because they really – they see an opportunity for them to go in and have a conversation with the customer. They also see a big opportunity to get the customers for collections and frankly living in two worlds where they have a maintenance model and subscription model isn't exactly in the partners of the customer's best interest. With regards to the customer reaction, I think it's going to take us a little bit more time to gather that reaction. The net that the customers are going to see in terms of value is going to increase, it's going to take us time to really get that, obviously we didn’t test all of this with our customers before we rolled it out because of the nature of the program. Amarpreet Hanspal Just what I'd add to that is from the customer's perspective I mean we're seeing our largest customers really respond very well to the flexibility of products subscription that suites their way of doing business. And also at the low end we are seeing people really respond well to the sort of the lower cash outlay the subscriptions demand from them. And the channel is really energized and is excited. This is a thing that you know how to do well and that was the feedback that Andrew referred to that we got at OTC. So I think right now it feels like the right set of things that are under way. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Andrew, I didn't quite catch if somebody moves some AutoCAD maintenance to collections, what's the actual uplift that we would see? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so they're so let me kind of do a little quick, I'm not going to all the math, but I'll give you a quick example. So if they just moved AutoCAD to AutoCAD, it's essentially a 5% increase from the maintenance as it is today. However, if they move that AutoCAD to a collection, it's going to be several $100 higher than that, all right and it's basically the Delta. So there it’s a significant uplift over what they'd be paying normally much more than 5%, but it's the smallest Delta they'll ever see in terms of getting the collections. So I think what’s you need to focus on is the fact that they'll never have a better way to get the collections in this path and essentially if they wait and they find the collections are important part of the solution in the future, they're going to pay a lot more. So a lot of customers just like back in the suites days when we ran all the suites plays, they're going to opt to take the collection route because the price is so attractive now. But it's still – they're still going to pay more because they moved to collections. It's not going to be just a 5% uplift of their current maintenance it's much more. Sterling Auty That makes sense. And then the follow-up is not that I’m expecting you to quantitatively tell us what's built into the guidance. But can give us a feel for okay how did you go about baking in the impact of this program into the guidance? So if there's a massive everybody says, yes, I really want to go to collections, what is said due to is it in immediate impact to revenue and cash flow, how does it come in and on the flip side if everybody says, yes I get what you're doing, but I'm just not interested and it's might of what you expect what kind of magnitude impact can we see to the way that you've guided? Andrew Anagnost So the most important thing you need to remember is its plus 5% on the maintenance base no matter what happens, all right. So there's a price increase in the maintenance base that happens just as a matter of course. So they're all going – the whole entire maintenance base you are going to see a 5% in price increase. They can choose to roll that 5% price increase into a subscription program at three-year lock if they want to but they're all going to see a 5% increase. To your second question about – the specifics about how many are going to move to collections that that's something we're going to watch over time, I expect most of that will be we’ll see later in the year as people try to decide these things, but everybody is going to see 5%. Scott Herren Yes, Sterling said another way. The price for maintenance after the 5% uplift is exact same price they would pay if they converted to subscriptions incentive. So it's from a modeling standpoint for fiscal 2018 at the same whether they convert or not. Sterling Auty Make sense. Thank you, guys. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. From Amar and Andrew could you talk about how you’ve ranged the division of labor between yourselves as come CEO's, so long as the arrangement last, how are you dividing your respected responsibilities for overseeing product sales operations and a like? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Jay, we are sharing responsibilities rather than dividing them. So Andrew and I have been the co-architects of the plan that you're seeing unfold right now. And so we continuing to work very closely together on for the technology transition as well as the business model transition that's implied. So he and I have been focusing on is driving you know greater focus and urgency on the execution of the plan and basically making decisions jointly through this period. So I wouldn't – well Andrew continue to do his marketing role and I continue to do my product role. The executive decisions we are making, we're making jointly. Andrew Anagnost And Jay just how we moved into this mode, we started this mode well before the announcement of Carl’s departure. So we got ourselves into a cadence of how we were going to make decisions? How we're going to work together on some of these things and Jay we work together for a long time. So we have a pretty good cadence set up already so there was no disruption as we move from the pre to the post Carl era? Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. My follow-up is did you say I think it Analyst Day on the last call that you expected the new model subspace to exceed the classic maintenance subspace by the end this fiscal year…? Andrew Anagnost That’s correct. This is the crossover year, Jay. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And related to that could you talk about how you’re thinking about the channel comp effects of this program in terms of their activity, how they get comp as they look through this program and what the MDS impacts might be? Amarpreet Hanspal Are you talking about the maintenance subscription program? Jay Vleeschhouwer Correct. Amarpreet Hanspal Okay. So obviously the comp structure is going to change on maintenance a bit as time goes on, otherwise the incentives wouldn't be in the right direction. So a partner is going to make more moving a customer to subscription then they're going to make keeping the customer on maintenance, and obviously it's going to be taking a little bit from one and give it to the other. Jay Vleeschhouwer Very good. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Jay. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow Hey. Thanks guys and congrats on a great end of the year. I just have two questions here. First, as far as when you look at the subscriptions right now that, the net new subscriptions that you're seeing, where are sort of people most compelled, I guess to move because obviously you have products here in the manufacturing vertical, you have a civil vertical, commercial construction where you seeing just the earliest uptake and I just have one follow-up to that? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Philip I would certainly say that AEC has been a place where – we see strength across all our verticals, honestly we started this journey on product subscriptions actually with our M&E business first and as we’ve rolled it out and do other products segment. We've seen strength in demand across all verticals. I would say that our AEC business grows – is continuing to grow at a very healthy rate really driven by the adoption of building information modeling around the world. So that's in building and civil all the sub-verticals in AEC, manufacturing has been extremely strong for us as well. In fact in manufacturing in addition to product subscriptions we've seen a growing uptick of the cloud-based solutions with Fusion both on the design side, on the simulation side as well as in the new sort of additive manufacturing fees. So we're very pleased with our growth across the vertical segments. Philip Winslow Got it. And then just a question for Scott and Andrew here about sort of the path, I guess on maintenance pricing because if you look at the price increases that you talk about 5%, 10%, 20% it does become very compelling to make the move this year and lock that, they call that 5% increase and going forward for three years if you're on subscription. So how do you think about converting the base because obviously the maintenance rates are going up and you'll be paying substantially more just one or two years out. So is there a potential this year where you see even faster subscriber growth because sort of act now or never and obviously these are long duration software applications, in other words, long lifecycle. Could you see a faster move and then as you think about the long-term guidance for more of a hockey stick an actual ARR and revenue. So it potentially faster subs, but a hockey stick later on and cause the ARR and revenue to get to those targets. How you just sort of thinking through that because obviously it was pretty compelling program? Amarpreet Hanspal All right. So first off let me just correct something you said. Remember this program is net neutral on subs adds because they're basically moving from one type of recurring revenue to another type of recurring revenue. So it's not a subs adds accelerators, it's an ARR phenomenon and one thing… Andrew Anagnost Yes. Our maintenance to better subscription. Amarpreet Hanspal It will absolutely have a cumulative effect as we move into FY2019 and FY2020. There's no doubt about it. It definitely builds on itself, the program. Now when you look at who's going to move, the people have the largest installations are going to be the ones that are looking right now to try to consider, hey should I move because it's going to make a material difference in their maintenance renewal moving forward and coming to the next year. Smaller accounts, they'll absorb the 5%. They might even absorb the 10%, but as they start looking out to the 20% they're obviously going to move. So you're going to see a chunk that moves in the first year representing a certain size of customer then you're going to see the next chunk that's going to move in the next year and then the people who are really, really attached to their perpetual license, which we don't think is going to be a lot of people will move later in the program. But you can see there's absolutely a cumulative effect to this and not only a cumulative effect from people moving, but remember the discount to move drops 5% every year as well. So the ones that move in the second year move at a higher loyalty price than the ones that move in the first year and the ones that move in the third year get a higher loyalty price, and then ultimately when these people who are locked in this three-year price drop off, the thee-year lock period, they then bounced up to the loyalty price at the end of the program, which is a little bit more than 15% of what they're paying now. So you can see there's a build up here and that will also provide us some runway into FY2021 and beyond in terms of how the base grows in terms of ARR. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. And what I’d add is that – I don't know whether you’d characterize this as a hockey stick, it's more of a cumulative effect of ARR as Andrew talked about. This is what gives us a lot of confidence in our FY2020 plan, because we do see programs like M2S and the other things that we're driving really set us up for success in the long run. Philip Winslow Great, guys. Thanks a lot. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Phil. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Kenneth Wong Hey, guys. So when looking at the maintenance sub decline of about 73,000 this quarter, any sense as to how many of those guys convert it over to a product subscription? Scott Herren Ken, I don't think we can project that. What we'd say is that the 73K number was as expected. This was our largest pool of maintenance customers up for renewal and our renewal rate was exactly where we'd expect them to be. So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us. So we will get better at tracking every single customer that goes from column A to column B, especially as we do the maintenance and subscription program. But I think there was nothing unusual about this 73K number that we saw. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then maybe a follow-up to that, as we try to kind of put this in the context of your seasonal Q4 and then the loyalty program you guys are putting in place. Should we see that that number grow and again not grow in a bad way, but obviously that could convert over, but is that 73 number a pretty good pace or too high to low? Scott Herren Yes. Ken, if you look at the seasonality of where we typically sold licenses, which is when the maintenance agreements will expire, right. Kenneth Wong Yes. Scott Herren It’s an annual maintenance agreement when you sold the license becomes the same quarter that maintenance comes through. The two biggest quarters for that are Q4 and Q1. So 73,000 in Q4 as Amar said was really – churn rate was right in line with our expectations, it is a big quarter in Q1 of renewal opportunities. In Q4, there's another big opportunity for renewals in Q1 as well. So obviously we're not guiding to that level of granularity, but it's not on line with what I would expect to see just based on the size of the renewal opportunity. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then they maybe last thing on those kind of the same point, but I might have missed when the program officially kicks in and then I guess what I guess we expect some sort of pull forward during that particular quarter? Andrew Anagnost Yes. The program starts in June and it's tied to their renewal, so there's no kind of pull forward effect here, it's all tied to the renewal event. So as people come up for renewal in a quarter, they get to choose, which path they go on. So it’s June and it's all tied to the renewal event. Kenneth Wong Got it. Okay, thanks to lot guys. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Ken. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Kash Rangan From one K to another K, thank you so much. If you can just give us a little bit of – I certainly appreciate the detail on the pricing uplift et cetera, but what is the incentive for the customer to do the 5% price increase for the maintenance. How is the Company going to explain to the customer? What is the value they’re going to get into turn for the 5% price increase? And also if you could just take a step back I think from the Analyst Day and from this conversation, what is the value to the customer, not from a financial standpoint, disincentive or an incentive, but how does the product fundamentally do different things in the cloud-based versions are the subscription, broadly speaking the subscription arrangement relative to what they were getting from the desktop software that currently – there was not been a lot of discussion, but would love to get enlightened there? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost So first of, Kash a 5% increase on anything is just that's kind of normal course of business in some respects. So the maintenance customers in terms of seeing a 5% price increase that's not going to change things very significantly in their view. And from our view, it's complicated for them, it's complicated for our partners, and it's complicated for the whole infrastructure to maintain these two models. So basically sending out a signal that if you want to maintain a perpetual license it's going to cost you more, it’s a positive signal for the whole ecosystem. And Amar and I will both answer the second question, I just want to put a little bit of a beginning on it. When a customer moves to the subscription model, they're moving to a model that has a lot more access control and insight into how they're using things. And I think that's an important value proposition just without additional products. I mean the access is anytime, anywhere products, they actually get access to different types of versions of products for instance in the AutoCAD world, they get a mobile, web and a desktop experience. They're able to control how they're used, turn them on and off, they get a lot more flexibility. And as we move forward throughout the year, the customers are going to see a lot more value add in the control side and the insight side and how they're using the products that I think is actually real money save for them, so they're going to see real value. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So Andrew is absolutely right about the installation and deployment experience that customers get the increase flexibility in terms of where to access things and who gets to access what. The other thing that we're doing is actually also changing the core product value proposition, increasing availability of cloud services on the products subscription side. And in fact there are pieces of our desktop software right now that are being rewritten as cloud services and really it's only those things are available as part of product subscription. So the product is not the same product as we move from the license model to the subscription model. We are actively evolving it to be much more of a hybrid experience and I think customers totally get that and they see that they're going to get access to a stream of innovation as opposed to the annual update that they used to get. Kash Rangan Thanks Amar and Andrew. Good to hear your voice on an earnings conference call. Not to leave you out, Scott, but any thoughts on when you'd be starting to – or if you could give us a little breakdown from this quarter between the EBA, cloud and the desktop subscriptions. Scott Herren Yes. Kash, we're not providing that level of granularity under new model, but as always happens in Q4. Q4 and Q1 are the biggest quarters for enterprise subscription adds, Q4 because we sell the most EBA’s and then they come on line throughout the quarter. Q1 is where we typically get the catch up because as you recall of EBA’s, we actually measure the active users because it’s a consumption model that's not a named user model, we haven't measure the active users and that takes 60 days before we can report those. So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base. Kash Rangan Wonderful. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Kash. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys. Sorry about being on mute before. Nice quarter. So one question just a clarification. Just so I'm clear. When a customer comes up for renewal they're being faced with a choice either pay 5% more for your renewal or pay 5% more and go onto desktop subscription. And the only reason they wouldn't want to go onto desktop subscription is if they like are afraid that at some point they don't want to pay maintenance anymore and they want to have that perpetual license, is that the correct way to think about it? Amarpreet Hanspal That's really the correct way to think about it and also a lot of the customers – because we took the unusual step of basically announcing what our intended price increase path is for maintenance, a lot of customers that are also going to be making the decision, okay. So how much is that perpetual license worth for me when I get this multi-year lock in price increase? And also we're going to be making it pretty clear to them over time, look at all the additional value you get on the subscription side. So you've got it, you’ve started out right that's how it's going to work at the renewal. Keith Weiss Right. You're not losing functionality when you go to a desktop subscription. You actually gain functionality. Amarpreet Hanspal You're gaining functionality and more important you're also gaining more control over how you actually use and manage the software. So it's a gain for the customer experience wise and capability wise. Keith Weiss Right. And you lock in the price for three years, but there's no sorts of definition of what happens after three years, not like after three years you're coming off a promotional pricing and you get jacked up to some higher pricing. Andrew Anagnost  Every year there's a different loyalty price for them to move. In year one it's 5% more than their current. In year two it's going to be little over 10% more than their current maintenance. And in year three it's a little over 15% above their current maintenance. So there's a different price for each year. When that three year lock in expires, that customer immediately goes up to the terminal loyalty price of a little over 15%, roughly 16% more than their maintenance price. Then they're kind of subject to ongoing price increases that would you affect what our long-term pricing strategy is. There's no giant leap up to the full subscription price. You can see there's still going up to a higher value level. Keith Weiss Got it. Makes sense. If I can just sneak one last one. You mentioned the uplift in value you see when you bring a customer to an EBA. I think you said three times the subscription rate. Should I think about that, I mean is that three times the monetization level that you were able to get out of these customers previously or is it like maintenance to subscription, so it's not really like full monetization if we think about it from a lifetime value of the customer. Amarpreet Hanspal Well, let's clarify that comment. It's three times the number of users that we see inside enterprise account. It generally leads to a higher level of token consumption, which generally leads to ever increasing values of EBA over time, but the multiplier isn’t exactly three, let’s put it that way. Keith Weiss Okay. Any sense you'd give us of what the increase in monetization you get out of moving a customer over to EBA? Amarpreet Hanspal Keith, we typically see at the – I think Steve gave some stats back in our Investor Day. We typically see an uplift in the 30% range at the point of renewal. Keith Weiss Yes, got it. Amarpreet Hanspal In other words when they go for maintenance and convert over to an EBA. Keith Weiss Got it, excellent. Thank you very much guys. Nice quarter. Andrew Anagnost Welcome. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Keith. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Rob Oliver Hey, guys. Thanks for taking one from the new guy. Have you guys noticed any change to the pace of new customer acquisitions? And then a follow-up for Scott. Andrew may have just answered this in response to Kash Rangan's question talking about additional access control, increased cloud services. Scott, you mentioned the high degree of confidence that 606 rev rec isn't going to impact you guys. Can you talk a little bit more about that, add some color there? Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost Sure. Let me take the new customer acquisition. I mean the place where we've seen growth in new customer acquisition has really been from the cloud products. We've certainly made penetration into construction, into manufacturing. We’ve seen growing momentum on that side of the ability to acquire customers that we didn't have before. I would say that depending on how you think about license compliance, you've got customers that have not paid us before. We're starting to make dent with our new model subscription in that customer base that's why a third of the new model subscriptions were really a new to our Company in the results that we saw in Q4. So we're definitely seeing new logos coming in as a result of both the combination of the could as well as product subscription. Scott Herren Yes. And then to the second part of your question Rob, on 606. I could have probably actually let Amar that as well because he has been into it up to his eyeballs. We are not expecting it to have any impact and I think I mentioned to you last time we met and I've said it a couple of times, the person is now our System Controller, used to run our rev ops team and has been a member of the AICPA task force on 606 for a couple of years. So we've had great insight into where this is headed and kind of how it's going to be interpreted and how the guidelines will be applied and going through what we're going through the business model transition. The last thing we wanted just to get to the end of this and have all that revenue flip back to upfront. So we've been working this for quite some time and I think Andrew just mentioned and Amar did as well. We've built in into our products subscription, a fair amount of integrated cloud functionality such that a significant amount of the value comes not just from the executables that come down to the endpoint, but from the interaction with the cloud services. And so we're quite confident that we're going to have a nominal impact from 606. Rob Oliver Got it, okay. Great, that's helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Scott Herren Thanks Rob. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Gal Munda Hi, guys. Just a few questions if I can. The first one is just to understand your pools full of active users, if we can look back retrospectively. At the start of 2016, we had a famous 5.1 million users, which was at the last capital market that it was kind of underestimated, but out of that users we had 2.3 million subs we know that. Now we're up to 3.1 million subs. What is your best guess on the other part of the pool, which initially was 2.8 million, today how big, is it because I’d mention it would be bigger than 2 million, the difference between 3.1 million and 5.1 million, but how do you look at that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. Actually one of our biggest opportunities as we move over the next couple years is converting users into subscribers, right. I mean that pretty basically they're using it, but they're not paying us. And if you remember from Investor Day, they come in two pools and actually we have fairly high fidelity in terms of information on how many of these people are active. So if you look at this non-subscribers base meaning people who bought a perpetual copy of software from us and then dropped off. The active level there is about a 2.2 million. So there's about 2.2 million active people using our software that aren't paying us, but have paid us in the past. The more interesting number is the 6 million plus pirates who are actively using our software and by the way we know that they're using the software because we're able to track the pirated serial numbers and the pirate activity. That's a more interesting number for us long-term and it's interesting to note that about 4 million of those pirates are in mature markets and about 1.2 million of them are in accounts that we know and have worked with in the past. So there is a very large base of users out there that are not subscribers. We're not going to be moving all of those over to us at once, but one of the things that’s really important, especially when it comes to the subscriber growth we're going to see this year is the momentum, we're going to be building into FY2017, because all of these programs that are targeted at the non-subscribers for instance are going to start seeing rapid acceleration as we head into the second half of the year, which is going to carry into FY2017. The products that Amar talked about earlier are actually going to have some pretty significant pool for these non-subscribers to move forward. That will not only be good for this year, it's going to be very good for FY2017. And the next thing we're doing this year is we're mainstreaming all of our piracy efforts, the efforts that are targeting these non-users and as we move into the end of this year and into FY2017, we will actually have in product purchasing capability for a pirate. So the pirate will actually get a notification and say hey, you might want to pay for the software. So this base is going to move over several years, but as you can see it's pretty big. Gal Munda Okay. So at least 2.2 active non-subscribers now plus at least… Andrew Anagnost 2.2 active non-subscribers plus another 6 million plus pirates. Gal Munda Okay. That makes sense. Andrew Anagnost That’s figured in our current paying base. Gal Munda Of course. Just as a follow-up, on the guidance you kind of expecting north of 600,000 monthly users over the next year is indicating some sort of acceleration especially considering historically when you guys talked about the volume of licenses as you would be saying between 600,000 and 700,000 would be the total volume licenses that you see in any given year. Now taking some sort of churn that we're seeing at the moment into that that would indicate that you're on the volume expecting more or something like 900,000 just very high level calculation. Does that indicate that you have – how does it compare to FY2017 you just finished and also does it indicate that there's some acceleration of the new users acquisition maybe some of the activation of that old pool? Scott Herren Yes. So good question, I mean look I think our unit volume for this year was right where we expected it to be and I think our growing momentum based on the factors that Andrew touched upon, we are certainly seeing increasing momentum through license compliance to what we would have called a legacy customer base. And one of the places where we are definitely accelerating acquisition of customers is also the cloud and as regions around the world whether they are emerging countries or places in Asia they come back to better economic health, they will contribute to this sort of overall unit volume growth. That's why we're very confident that the momentum we're carrying into this year combined with license compliance legacy as well as momentum in cloud as well as the changes that we talked about in the product that really drive customers to be more current. They're all factors that we believe will drive that result that we pointed to. Gal Munda Okay. Andrew Anagnost Yes, Gal, one of the things that of course was not in that historic range of – actually we said 500,000, 800,000, but the midpoints the same with year 600,000 to 700,000. What's not in air forces cloud and so as we've seen the cloud begin to accelerated and it's not in our the unit volume that we referred to from time-to-time either. So take that as what's happening in the core business, later on the increase we're seeing as Amar just pointed out in both legacy recapture and the sort of our piracy programs and then put cloud on top of that. That's how you get the total gross. Gal Munda Okay and the total growth that you're expecting – is it around 900,000 is fair to say? Amarpreet Hanspal So we're not guiding at that level. We're not providing that type of inside, but we feel confident in the 600,000 to 650,000 net sub ads for the year. Gal Munda Okay. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Gal. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Monika Garg Thanks for taking my question. First, given that in Q4 soul in the perpetual license, it was mainly subscription why would revenue guidance for Q1 is flattish to more its lower? Andrew Anagnost Yes, Monika the one think when you look year-on-year and you got the data now for the full-year of fiscal 2017. The non-recurring element of course included six months of suite perpetual license sales. There won't be any suite perpetual license sales of course, but that means as the total non-recurring revenue year-on-year is coming down pretty significantly. So we gave you a couple of data points earlier. So we guided revenue into a range of 2 billion to 2.05 billion and said in the opening commentary that we expect that about 90% to be recurring, right. So if you do the quick math you can say the non-recurring fees is going to be ballpark $200 million. If you look at what that was last year that was closer to $500 billion. And so I think where the differences in the year-on-year, it's certainly we're seeing great growth on the recurring side, you see that in our ARR guidance, but the non-recurring element of course is coming down year-on-year. Monika Garg Right. I was actually looking Q-over-Q right, from 4Q to 1Q? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so you can see the same thing from Q4 to Q1. Monika Garg Okay. Andrew Anagnost Right, you will see the non-recurring elements coming down pretty significantly. Monika Garg Got it. And then coming back to the maintenance pricing increase of the loyalty program you talked about. What is the risk of losing customers to competition due to this maintenance pricing increase you have talked about with your channel over the next year? Thank you. Scott Herren Yes, so one of the reasons we structured the program the way we did is we were really focused on minimizing the churn off of that maintenance base. So we feel that the way we structured the program, the huge incentives for loyalty that we're giving the maintenance customers is really a churn minimization plan. So we're feeling pretty confident. Our competitors have historically tried to make incursions into our installed base as we move to subscription, but the truth of the matter is none of them have been particularly successful and it's really hard to compete with software that that prices and accessibility levels that are far below what they've been historically when you come in with more expensive perpetual software. So yes competitors try to make encourage their incursions. They haven't been successful and I think we structured this program as a churn minimization program with a primary goal. Monika Garg Got it. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks, Monika. End of Q&A Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn things over to David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, Karen. That concludes our conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question for today comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Saket Kalia Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just first to start with, Andrew, Andrew, you kind of talked about some of the changes that you're making to maintenance pricing and new model to incentive that conversion. Could you quickly recap the promotion that you're specifically running on product subscription if they trade in their perpetual license? And more broadly, how are you thinking about the maintenance subs to new model subs conversion in 2018? Andrew Anagnost Yes, all right. So let me just recap some basic details you’re seeing, you get the understanding. So the way this works is the customer in return for trading in a perpetual license gets a very big discount to move to subscription, essentially what they're doing is they're paying 5% more than they would pay today on their current maintenance, if they were going right now from today. So they get to move over at that price and they get to lock that price in for three years. So if they move early, they get much more advantage then if they wait. Now one of the things that's important about this program and things we're looking at, we want to move is many of these maintenance customers as possible, really we want to move 100%. Churn is the enemy of this program. So the reason we structured at the way we have with these 5% increases in this discount to move is because we want 100% of them to move. And the advantages we're going to get out of this is to look as they move, they're going to be making different kinds of choices. A lot of them are going to have the best possible price to get to collection that they've ever seen. So what we're going to see instead of a customer moving from maintenance, on AutoCAD to subscription on AutoCAD, they're going to move from AutoCAD maintenance to collection subscription, which by the way has a greater uplift on top of the maintenance base and than just what we're doing. In addition some of the customers are going to stay behind on maintenance. This is just going to be their preferred path. They're going to stay there till the second year of the program and maybe not move until the third year of the program. So they're obviously going to see continual price increases to maintain that perpetual license, but it’s important to them, they're going to end up paying more. But the net result of what we're trying to do is over a three-year period move the majority of that base over. I'm not going to give you specifics about how many we expect to move over this year, but we certainly expect people to start considering this program and we expect to see a lot of our larger customers at the top of the pyramid and down at the bottom where they get a lot of engagement from partners moving quickly. Saket Kalia Great. That's really helpful. And then maybe for my follow-up, actually for you again, Andrew, I just want to confirm, I think you mentioned that new model ARPS of course was up this quarter but could flux quarter to quarter. I may have missed it but can you just confirm, it sounded like it should be roughly flat from a dollar perspective throughout 2018. Is that correct? Andrew Anagnost So if you remember what I said at Investor Day earlier, it's going to start to trend up in the second half of the year. The increase we saw in Q4 is basically a result of the fact that we didn't have a promo in Q4 and we had one in Q3. So you're not going to see that continue, you are going to see some kind of variability as we head through Q1, Q2 and Q3, but as we move into the second half it's not going to be flat, it's actually going to trend up in the latter half of the year. And that's just going to be a result of the accumulation of new model ARPS that we're going to be seeing especially on the products subside and the mix of more mature markets buying product set. Saket Kalia That's very helpful. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost You're welcome. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color. I remember at the Investor Day and I apologize if you touched on this in earlier comments President if you could give us a little bit more color about the mix of the cloud subs versus the new – versus the desktop subscriptions and let us know, one, kind of where are you seeing strength in that and how do you – how are you thinking about splitting that out going forward they terms of disclosure? Amarpreet Hanspal Well, Heather, let me take the first part of that question and then Scott can weigh in on the disclosure parts. We saw strength across the board on all types of subscriptions and clearly product descriptions are very strong and we saw EBA’s as I mentioned in the earlier remarks. We had lots of strength in the EBA. We had a record quarter in the cloud because I think it was three times the number of subscriptions that you assume in any prior quarter, so we are definitely seeing a lot of growth from our new cloud-based offerings, but we have continued strength in product subscriptions across the board and we expect that momentum to be carried into this fiscal year. Scott Herren Yes. And Heather within that the strength comes from BIM 360 largely followed by Fusion and then shotgun .  So it was a very strong quarter, it's good to see the cloud products which will be key to kind of the second wave of the transition that the cloud products begin to take off. In terms of disclosure, I would say at this point well it's – we're seeing good growth, still good growth off a small base and it's having a bigger effect obviously on subs and it is on ARR as that becomes material or we think it's clouding the results and making it too difficult to model that's will consider breaking it out. Heather Bellini Okay. And then just one quick follow-up if you don't mind. In regards to the changes that you sent out to the channel partners today, what's been – have you heard any – I imagine you kind of tested the waters on this of before you did it. What type of feedback did you get from customers or from channel partners about the strategy to basically main thence customers paying that increase in price and the move to subscription, basically trading they your license to move to subscription, what type of feedback did you hear if you ran that by any of your larger customers before you did this in? Andrew Anagnost So Heather we do test a lot of these things. Amar and I just got back from our sales conference and I think the most relevant feedback I can give you is that our partners are very, very positive about this program mostly because they really – they see an opportunity for them to go in and have a conversation with the customer. They also see a big opportunity to get the customers for collections and frankly living in two worlds where they have a maintenance model and subscription model isn't exactly in the partners of the customer's best interest. With regards to the customer reaction, I think it's going to take us a little bit more time to gather that reaction. The net that the customers are going to see in terms of value is going to increase, it's going to take us time to really get that, obviously we didn’t test all of this with our customers before we rolled it out because of the nature of the program. Amarpreet Hanspal Just what I'd add to that is from the customer's perspective I mean we're seeing our largest customers really respond very well to the flexibility of products subscription that suites their way of doing business. And also at the low end we are seeing people really respond well to the sort of the lower cash outlay the subscriptions demand from them. And the channel is really energized and is excited. This is a thing that you know how to do well and that was the feedback that Andrew referred to that we got at OTC. So I think right now it feels like the right set of things that are under way. Heather Bellini Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling Auty Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Andrew, I didn't quite catch if somebody moves some AutoCAD maintenance to collections, what's the actual uplift that we would see? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so they're so let me kind of do a little quick, I'm not going to all the math, but I'll give you a quick example. So if they just moved AutoCAD to AutoCAD, it's essentially a 5% increase from the maintenance as it is today. However, if they move that AutoCAD to a collection, it's going to be several $100 higher than that, all right and it's basically the Delta. So there it’s a significant uplift over what they'd be paying normally much more than 5%, but it's the smallest Delta they'll ever see in terms of getting the collections. So I think what’s you need to focus on is the fact that they'll never have a better way to get the collections in this path and essentially if they wait and they find the collections are important part of the solution in the future, they're going to pay a lot more. So a lot of customers just like back in the suites days when we ran all the suites plays, they're going to opt to take the collection route because the price is so attractive now. But it's still – they're still going to pay more because they moved to collections. It's not going to be just a 5% uplift of their current maintenance it's much more. Sterling Auty That makes sense. And then the follow-up is not that I’m expecting you to quantitatively tell us what's built into the guidance. But can give us a feel for okay how did you go about baking in the impact of this program into the guidance? So if there's a massive everybody says, yes, I really want to go to collections, what is said due to is it in immediate impact to revenue and cash flow, how does it come in and on the flip side if everybody says, yes I get what you're doing, but I'm just not interested and it's might of what you expect what kind of magnitude impact can we see to the way that you've guided? Andrew Anagnost So the most important thing you need to remember is its plus 5% on the maintenance base no matter what happens, all right. So there's a price increase in the maintenance base that happens just as a matter of course. So they're all going – the whole entire maintenance base you are going to see a 5% in price increase. They can choose to roll that 5% price increase into a subscription program at three-year lock if they want to but they're all going to see a 5% increase. To your second question about – the specifics about how many are going to move to collections that that's something we're going to watch over time, I expect most of that will be we’ll see later in the year as people try to decide these things, but everybody is going to see 5%. Scott Herren Yes, Sterling said another way. The price for maintenance after the 5% uplift is exact same price they would pay if they converted to subscriptions incentive. So it's from a modeling standpoint for fiscal 2018 at the same whether they convert or not. Sterling Auty Make sense. Thank you, guys. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. From Amar and Andrew could you talk about how you’ve ranged the division of labor between yourselves as come CEO's, so long as the arrangement last, how are you dividing your respected responsibilities for overseeing product sales operations and a like? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Jay, we are sharing responsibilities rather than dividing them. So Andrew and I have been the co-architects of the plan that you're seeing unfold right now. And so we continuing to work very closely together on for the technology transition as well as the business model transition that's implied. So he and I have been focusing on is driving you know greater focus and urgency on the execution of the plan and basically making decisions jointly through this period. So I wouldn't – well Andrew continue to do his marketing role and I continue to do my product role. The executive decisions we are making, we're making jointly. Andrew Anagnost And Jay just how we moved into this mode, we started this mode well before the announcement of Carl’s departure. So we got ourselves into a cadence of how we were going to make decisions? How we're going to work together on some of these things and Jay we work together for a long time. So we have a pretty good cadence set up already so there was no disruption as we move from the pre to the post Carl era? Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. My follow-up is did you say I think it Analyst Day on the last call that you expected the new model subspace to exceed the classic maintenance subspace by the end this fiscal year…? Andrew Anagnost That’s correct. This is the crossover year, Jay. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And related to that could you talk about how you’re thinking about the channel comp effects of this program in terms of their activity, how they get comp as they look through this program and what the MDS impacts might be? Amarpreet Hanspal Are you talking about the maintenance subscription program? Jay Vleeschhouwer Correct. Amarpreet Hanspal Okay. So obviously the comp structure is going to change on maintenance a bit as time goes on, otherwise the incentives wouldn't be in the right direction. So a partner is going to make more moving a customer to subscription then they're going to make keeping the customer on maintenance, and obviously it's going to be taking a little bit from one and give it to the other. Jay Vleeschhouwer Very good. Thanks very much. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Jay. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Philip Winslow Hey. Thanks guys and congrats on a great end of the year. I just have two questions here. First, as far as when you look at the subscriptions right now that, the net new subscriptions that you're seeing, where are sort of people most compelled, I guess to move because obviously you have products here in the manufacturing vertical, you have a civil vertical, commercial construction where you seeing just the earliest uptake and I just have one follow-up to that? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes, Philip I would certainly say that AEC has been a place where – we see strength across all our verticals, honestly we started this journey on product subscriptions actually with our M&E business first and as we’ve rolled it out and do other products segment. We've seen strength in demand across all verticals. I would say that our AEC business grows – is continuing to grow at a very healthy rate really driven by the adoption of building information modeling around the world. So that's in building and civil all the sub-verticals in AEC, manufacturing has been extremely strong for us as well. In fact in manufacturing in addition to product subscriptions we've seen a growing uptick of the cloud-based solutions with Fusion both on the design side, on the simulation side as well as in the new sort of additive manufacturing fees. So we're very pleased with our growth across the vertical segments. Philip Winslow Got it. And then just a question for Scott and Andrew here about sort of the path, I guess on maintenance pricing because if you look at the price increases that you talk about 5%, 10%, 20% it does become very compelling to make the move this year and lock that, they call that 5% increase and going forward for three years if you're on subscription. So how do you think about converting the base because obviously the maintenance rates are going up and you'll be paying substantially more just one or two years out. So is there a potential this year where you see even faster subscriber growth because sort of act now or never and obviously these are long duration software applications, in other words, long lifecycle. Could you see a faster move and then as you think about the long-term guidance for more of a hockey stick an actual ARR and revenue. So it potentially faster subs, but a hockey stick later on and cause the ARR and revenue to get to those targets. How you just sort of thinking through that because obviously it was pretty compelling program? Amarpreet Hanspal All right. So first off let me just correct something you said. Remember this program is net neutral on subs adds because they're basically moving from one type of recurring revenue to another type of recurring revenue. So it's not a subs adds accelerators, it's an ARR phenomenon and one thing… Andrew Anagnost Yes. Our maintenance to better subscription. Amarpreet Hanspal It will absolutely have a cumulative effect as we move into FY2019 and FY2020. There's no doubt about it. It definitely builds on itself, the program. Now when you look at who's going to move, the people have the largest installations are going to be the ones that are looking right now to try to consider, hey should I move because it's going to make a material difference in their maintenance renewal moving forward and coming to the next year. Smaller accounts, they'll absorb the 5%. They might even absorb the 10%, but as they start looking out to the 20% they're obviously going to move. So you're going to see a chunk that moves in the first year representing a certain size of customer then you're going to see the next chunk that's going to move in the next year and then the people who are really, really attached to their perpetual license, which we don't think is going to be a lot of people will move later in the program. But you can see there's absolutely a cumulative effect to this and not only a cumulative effect from people moving, but remember the discount to move drops 5% every year as well. So the ones that move in the second year move at a higher loyalty price than the ones that move in the first year and the ones that move in the third year get a higher loyalty price, and then ultimately when these people who are locked in this three-year price drop off, the thee-year lock period, they then bounced up to the loyalty price at the end of the program, which is a little bit more than 15% of what they're paying now. So you can see there's a build up here and that will also provide us some runway into FY2021 and beyond in terms of how the base grows in terms of ARR. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. And what I’d add is that – I don't know whether you’d characterize this as a hockey stick, it's more of a cumulative effect of ARR as Andrew talked about. This is what gives us a lot of confidence in our FY2020 plan, because we do see programs like M2S and the other things that we're driving really set us up for success in the long run. Philip Winslow Great, guys. Thanks a lot. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Phil. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Citigroup. Kenneth Wong Hey, guys. So when looking at the maintenance sub decline of about 73,000 this quarter, any sense as to how many of those guys convert it over to a product subscription? Scott Herren Ken, I don't think we can project that. What we'd say is that the 73K number was as expected. This was our largest pool of maintenance customers up for renewal and our renewal rate was exactly where we'd expect them to be. So the number is not unusual or unexpected for us. So we will get better at tracking every single customer that goes from column A to column B, especially as we do the maintenance and subscription program. But I think there was nothing unusual about this 73K number that we saw. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then maybe a follow-up to that, as we try to kind of put this in the context of your seasonal Q4 and then the loyalty program you guys are putting in place. Should we see that that number grow and again not grow in a bad way, but obviously that could convert over, but is that 73 number a pretty good pace or too high to low? Scott Herren Yes. Ken, if you look at the seasonality of where we typically sold licenses, which is when the maintenance agreements will expire, right. Kenneth Wong Yes. Scott Herren It’s an annual maintenance agreement when you sold the license becomes the same quarter that maintenance comes through. The two biggest quarters for that are Q4 and Q1. So 73,000 in Q4 as Amar said was really – churn rate was right in line with our expectations, it is a big quarter in Q1 of renewal opportunities. In Q4, there's another big opportunity for renewals in Q1 as well. So obviously we're not guiding to that level of granularity, but it's not on line with what I would expect to see just based on the size of the renewal opportunity. Kenneth Wong Got it. And then they maybe last thing on those kind of the same point, but I might have missed when the program officially kicks in and then I guess what I guess we expect some sort of pull forward during that particular quarter? Andrew Anagnost Yes. The program starts in June and it's tied to their renewal, so there's no kind of pull forward effect here, it's all tied to the renewal event. So as people come up for renewal in a quarter, they get to choose, which path they go on. So it’s June and it's all tied to the renewal event. Kenneth Wong Got it. Okay, thanks to lot guys. Andrew Anagnost Thanks Ken. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Kash Rangan From one K to another K, thank you so much. If you can just give us a little bit of – I certainly appreciate the detail on the pricing uplift et cetera, but what is the incentive for the customer to do the 5% price increase for the maintenance. How is the Company going to explain to the customer? What is the value they’re going to get into turn for the 5% price increase? And also if you could just take a step back I think from the Analyst Day and from this conversation, what is the value to the customer, not from a financial standpoint, disincentive or an incentive, but how does the product fundamentally do different things in the cloud-based versions are the subscription, broadly speaking the subscription arrangement relative to what they were getting from the desktop software that currently – there was not been a lot of discussion, but would love to get enlightened there? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost So first of, Kash a 5% increase on anything is just that's kind of normal course of business in some respects. So the maintenance customers in terms of seeing a 5% price increase that's not going to change things very significantly in their view. And from our view, it's complicated for them, it's complicated for our partners, and it's complicated for the whole infrastructure to maintain these two models. So basically sending out a signal that if you want to maintain a perpetual license it's going to cost you more, it’s a positive signal for the whole ecosystem. And Amar and I will both answer the second question, I just want to put a little bit of a beginning on it. When a customer moves to the subscription model, they're moving to a model that has a lot more access control and insight into how they're using things. And I think that's an important value proposition just without additional products. I mean the access is anytime, anywhere products, they actually get access to different types of versions of products for instance in the AutoCAD world, they get a mobile, web and a desktop experience. They're able to control how they're used, turn them on and off, they get a lot more flexibility. And as we move forward throughout the year, the customers are going to see a lot more value add in the control side and the insight side and how they're using the products that I think is actually real money save for them, so they're going to see real value. Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So Andrew is absolutely right about the installation and deployment experience that customers get the increase flexibility in terms of where to access things and who gets to access what. The other thing that we're doing is actually also changing the core product value proposition, increasing availability of cloud services on the products subscription side. And in fact there are pieces of our desktop software right now that are being rewritten as cloud services and really it's only those things are available as part of product subscription. So the product is not the same product as we move from the license model to the subscription model. We are actively evolving it to be much more of a hybrid experience and I think customers totally get that and they see that they're going to get access to a stream of innovation as opposed to the annual update that they used to get. Kash Rangan Thanks Amar and Andrew. Good to hear your voice on an earnings conference call. Not to leave you out, Scott, but any thoughts on when you'd be starting to – or if you could give us a little breakdown from this quarter between the EBA, cloud and the desktop subscriptions. Scott Herren Yes. Kash, we're not providing that level of granularity under new model, but as always happens in Q4. Q4 and Q1 are the biggest quarters for enterprise subscription adds, Q4 because we sell the most EBA’s and then they come on line throughout the quarter. Q1 is where we typically get the catch up because as you recall of EBA’s, we actually measure the active users because it’s a consumption model that's not a named user model, we haven't measure the active users and that takes 60 days before we can report those. So I think of enterprises being heavier in Q4 and Q1, products subs are very strong, we mentioned that in the opening commentary that was the leading driver of the growth, 227,000 remodel sub adds during the quarter and cloud was also strong albeit from a smaller base. Kash Rangan Wonderful. Thanks. Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Kash. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys. Sorry about being on mute before. Nice quarter. So one question just a clarification. Just so I'm clear. When a customer comes up for renewal they're being faced with a choice either pay 5% more for your renewal or pay 5% more and go onto desktop subscription. And the only reason they wouldn't want to go onto desktop subscription is if they like are afraid that at some point they don't want to pay maintenance anymore and they want to have that perpetual license, is that the correct way to think about it? Amarpreet Hanspal That's really the correct way to think about it and also a lot of the customers – because we took the unusual step of basically announcing what our intended price increase path is for maintenance, a lot of customers that are also going to be making the decision, okay. So how much is that perpetual license worth for me when I get this multi-year lock in price increase? And also we're going to be making it pretty clear to them over time, look at all the additional value you get on the subscription side. So you've got it, you’ve started out right that's how it's going to work at the renewal. Keith Weiss Right. You're not losing functionality when you go to a desktop subscription. You actually gain functionality. Amarpreet Hanspal You're gaining functionality and more important you're also gaining more control over how you actually use and manage the software. So it's a gain for the customer experience wise and capability wise. Keith Weiss Right. And you lock in the price for three years, but there's no sorts of definition of what happens after three years, not like after three years you're coming off a promotional pricing and you get jacked up to some higher pricing. Andrew Anagnost  Every year there's a different loyalty price for them to move. In year one it's 5% more than their current. In year two it's going to be little over 10% more than their current maintenance. And in year three it's a little over 15% above their current maintenance. So there's a different price for each year. When that three year lock in expires, that customer immediately goes up to the terminal loyalty price of a little over 15%, roughly 16% more than their maintenance price. Then they're kind of subject to ongoing price increases that would you affect what our long-term pricing strategy is. There's no giant leap up to the full subscription price. You can see there's still going up to a higher value level. Keith Weiss Got it. Makes sense. If I can just sneak one last one. You mentioned the uplift in value you see when you bring a customer to an EBA. I think you said three times the subscription rate. Should I think about that, I mean is that three times the monetization level that you were able to get out of these customers previously or is it like maintenance to subscription, so it's not really like full monetization if we think about it from a lifetime value of the customer. Amarpreet Hanspal Well, let's clarify that comment. It's three times the number of users that we see inside enterprise account. It generally leads to a higher level of token consumption, which generally leads to ever increasing values of EBA over time, but the multiplier isn’t exactly three, let’s put it that way. Keith Weiss Okay. Any sense you'd give us of what the increase in monetization you get out of moving a customer over to EBA? Amarpreet Hanspal Keith, we typically see at the – I think Steve gave some stats back in our Investor Day. We typically see an uplift in the 30% range at the point of renewal. Keith Weiss Yes, got it. Amarpreet Hanspal In other words when they go for maintenance and convert over to an EBA. Keith Weiss Got it, excellent. Thank you very much guys. Nice quarter. Andrew Anagnost Welcome. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Keith. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Rob Oliver Hey, guys. Thanks for taking one from the new guy. Have you guys noticed any change to the pace of new customer acquisitions? And then a follow-up for Scott. Andrew may have just answered this in response to Kash Rangan's question talking about additional access control, increased cloud services. Scott, you mentioned the high degree of confidence that 606 rev rec isn't going to impact you guys. Can you talk a little bit more about that, add some color there? Thanks so much. Andrew Anagnost Sure. Let me take the new customer acquisition. I mean the place where we've seen growth in new customer acquisition has really been from the cloud products. We've certainly made penetration into construction, into manufacturing. We’ve seen growing momentum on that side of the ability to acquire customers that we didn't have before. I would say that depending on how you think about license compliance, you've got customers that have not paid us before. We're starting to make dent with our new model subscription in that customer base that's why a third of the new model subscriptions were really a new to our Company in the results that we saw in Q4. So we're definitely seeing new logos coming in as a result of both the combination of the could as well as product subscription. Scott Herren Yes. And then to the second part of your question Rob, on 606. I could have probably actually let Amar that as well because he has been into it up to his eyeballs. We are not expecting it to have any impact and I think I mentioned to you last time we met and I've said it a couple of times, the person is now our System Controller, used to run our rev ops team and has been a member of the AICPA task force on 606 for a couple of years. So we've had great insight into where this is headed and kind of how it's going to be interpreted and how the guidelines will be applied and going through what we're going through the business model transition. The last thing we wanted just to get to the end of this and have all that revenue flip back to upfront. So we've been working this for quite some time and I think Andrew just mentioned and Amar did as well. We've built in into our products subscription, a fair amount of integrated cloud functionality such that a significant amount of the value comes not just from the executables that come down to the endpoint, but from the interaction with the cloud services. And so we're quite confident that we're going to have a nominal impact from 606. Rob Oliver Got it, okay. Great, that's helpful. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it. Scott Herren Thanks Rob. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda from Berenberg. Gal Munda Hi, guys. Just a few questions if I can. The first one is just to understand your pools full of active users, if we can look back retrospectively. At the start of 2016, we had a famous 5.1 million users, which was at the last capital market that it was kind of underestimated, but out of that users we had 2.3 million subs we know that. Now we're up to 3.1 million subs. What is your best guess on the other part of the pool, which initially was 2.8 million, today how big, is it because I’d mention it would be bigger than 2 million, the difference between 3.1 million and 5.1 million, but how do you look at that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. Actually one of our biggest opportunities as we move over the next couple years is converting users into subscribers, right. I mean that pretty basically they're using it, but they're not paying us. And if you remember from Investor Day, they come in two pools and actually we have fairly high fidelity in terms of information on how many of these people are active. So if you look at this non-subscribers base meaning people who bought a perpetual copy of software from us and then dropped off. The active level there is about a 2.2 million. So there's about 2.2 million active people using our software that aren't paying us, but have paid us in the past. The more interesting number is the 6 million plus pirates who are actively using our software and by the way we know that they're using the software because we're able to track the pirated serial numbers and the pirate activity. That's a more interesting number for us long-term and it's interesting to note that about 4 million of those pirates are in mature markets and about 1.2 million of them are in accounts that we know and have worked with in the past. So there is a very large base of users out there that are not subscribers. We're not going to be moving all of those over to us at once, but one of the things that’s really important, especially when it comes to the subscriber growth we're going to see this year is the momentum, we're going to be building into FY2017, because all of these programs that are targeted at the non-subscribers for instance are going to start seeing rapid acceleration as we head into the second half of the year, which is going to carry into FY2017. The products that Amar talked about earlier are actually going to have some pretty significant pool for these non-subscribers to move forward. That will not only be good for this year, it's going to be very good for FY2017. And the next thing we're doing this year is we're mainstreaming all of our piracy efforts, the efforts that are targeting these non-users and as we move into the end of this year and into FY2017, we will actually have in product purchasing capability for a pirate. So the pirate will actually get a notification and say hey, you might want to pay for the software. So this base is going to move over several years, but as you can see it's pretty big. Gal Munda Okay. So at least 2.2 active non-subscribers now plus at least… Andrew Anagnost 2.2 active non-subscribers plus another 6 million plus pirates. Gal Munda Okay. That makes sense. Andrew Anagnost That’s figured in our current paying base. Gal Munda Of course. Just as a follow-up, on the guidance you kind of expecting north of 600,000 monthly users over the next year is indicating some sort of acceleration especially considering historically when you guys talked about the volume of licenses as you would be saying between 600,000 and 700,000 would be the total volume licenses that you see in any given year. Now taking some sort of churn that we're seeing at the moment into that that would indicate that you're on the volume expecting more or something like 900,000 just very high level calculation. Does that indicate that you have – how does it compare to FY2017 you just finished and also does it indicate that there's some acceleration of the new users acquisition maybe some of the activation of that old pool? Scott Herren Yes. So good question, I mean look I think our unit volume for this year was right where we expected it to be and I think our growing momentum based on the factors that Andrew touched upon, we are certainly seeing increasing momentum through license compliance to what we would have called a legacy customer base. And one of the places where we are definitely accelerating acquisition of customers is also the cloud and as regions around the world whether they are emerging countries or places in Asia they come back to better economic health, they will contribute to this sort of overall unit volume growth. That's why we're very confident that the momentum we're carrying into this year combined with license compliance legacy as well as momentum in cloud as well as the changes that we talked about in the product that really drive customers to be more current. They're all factors that we believe will drive that result that we pointed to. Gal Munda Okay. Andrew Anagnost Yes, Gal, one of the things that of course was not in that historic range of – actually we said 500,000, 800,000, but the midpoints the same with year 600,000 to 700,000. What's not in air forces cloud and so as we've seen the cloud begin to accelerated and it's not in our the unit volume that we referred to from time-to-time either. So take that as what's happening in the core business, later on the increase we're seeing as Amar just pointed out in both legacy recapture and the sort of our piracy programs and then put cloud on top of that. That's how you get the total gross. Gal Munda Okay and the total growth that you're expecting – is it around 900,000 is fair to say? Amarpreet Hanspal So we're not guiding at that level. We're not providing that type of inside, but we feel confident in the 600,000 to 650,000 net sub ads for the year. Gal Munda Okay. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Gal. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg from Pacific Crest Securities. Monika Garg Thanks for taking my question. First, given that in Q4 soul in the perpetual license, it was mainly subscription why would revenue guidance for Q1 is flattish to more its lower? Andrew Anagnost Yes, Monika the one think when you look year-on-year and you got the data now for the full-year of fiscal 2017. The non-recurring element of course included six months of suite perpetual license sales. There won't be any suite perpetual license sales of course, but that means as the total non-recurring revenue year-on-year is coming down pretty significantly. So we gave you a couple of data points earlier. So we guided revenue into a range of 2 billion to 2.05 billion and said in the opening commentary that we expect that about 90% to be recurring, right. So if you do the quick math you can say the non-recurring fees is going to be ballpark $200 million. If you look at what that was last year that was closer to $500 billion. And so I think where the differences in the year-on-year, it's certainly we're seeing great growth on the recurring side, you see that in our ARR guidance, but the non-recurring element of course is coming down year-on-year. Monika Garg Right. I was actually looking Q-over-Q right, from 4Q to 1Q? Andrew Anagnost Yes, so you can see the same thing from Q4 to Q1. Monika Garg Okay. Andrew Anagnost Right, you will see the non-recurring elements coming down pretty significantly. Monika Garg Got it. And then coming back to the maintenance pricing increase of the loyalty program you talked about. What is the risk of losing customers to competition due to this maintenance pricing increase you have talked about with your channel over the next year? Thank you. Scott Herren Yes, so one of the reasons we structured the program the way we did is we were really focused on minimizing the churn off of that maintenance base. So we feel that the way we structured the program, the huge incentives for loyalty that we're giving the maintenance customers is really a churn minimization plan. So we're feeling pretty confident. Our competitors have historically tried to make incursions into our installed base as we move to subscription, but the truth of the matter is none of them have been particularly successful and it's really hard to compete with software that that prices and accessibility levels that are far below what they've been historically when you come in with more expensive perpetual software. So yes competitors try to make encourage their incursions. They haven't been successful and I think we structured this program as a churn minimization program with a primary goal. Monika Garg Got it. Thank you so much. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks, Monika. End of Q&A Operator Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn things over to David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, Karen. That concludes our conference call for today.

We will quote a number of numeric or growth changes as we discuss our financial performance, unless otherwise noted each such reference represents a year-on-year comparison. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Amar. Amarpreet Hanspal Thanks Dave. We’re after an impressive start with the new fiscal year with broad based strength across all subscription types and geographies. These types of results are increasing our confident in the acceptance of the subscription model and our ability to achieve our goals. There are several areas to highlight in Q1 including, we added a record 186,000 total subscriptions. Total ARR grew 20% at constant currency. Recurring revenue jumped to 90% of total revenue and we over-achieve on both our revenue and spend goal, leading to better than expected in EPS. As we’ve demonstrated over the past several quarters, we are executing well and making real progress on our two major initiatives, growing the lifetime customer value by moving customers to the subscription model and expanding our market opportunity with increasing adoption of our cloud based solutions. Now let’s dive to our Q1 performance a little more. Before I get too far, I want to note a change in our terminology. New model is now known simply as subscription plan to synchronize with our new revenue reporting terminology. Just like new model, subscription plan consists of product subscriptions and end-of-life subscriptions and cloud subscriptions. We added 233,000 subscription plan subs in Q1, which is even higher, there are seasonality strong fourth quarter of last year. Once more the net record 186,000 total subscription additions resulting from strength across all subscription plan types and a higher renewal rate for maintenance planned subs. One of the best signal with the health of our business with the strong demand for our core designing engineering product, which is reflected in impressive year-over-year growth of over 170% in product subscriptions even more pleasing was the strength in product subscriptions was broad based, with triple digit growth across all geographies and very strong growth in emerging markets. Once again, new customers represented about a third of our new product subscriptions for the quarter. These new customers come from a mix of market expansion, growing in emerging countries, unlicensed users and people who have been using an alternate design tool. Subscription plans starts also had a strong contribution from our new enterprise customers. I mentioned on last quarter's call that in Q4, we had signed up a record number of enterprise customers for our token base of consumption style EDAs, and that because of the way we count our subscriptions, we see the benefit to net new subscriptions in Q1 just as we did in the first quarter of last 2 fiscal years. These EDAs contributed a record 44,000 subscription additions in Q1 of this year, 10% more than Q1 of last year. EDAs with our large enterprise customers have been a very successful component of our transition leading to both increased subscriptions and account value while creating increased flexibility for our customers.  The third component of our subscription plan starts is our cloud products. This is the TAM expansion part of our business and we are building on our leadership in the cloud. Cloud subscription additions continue to show strong growth growing by over 4 times Q1 of last year, and these were driven by BIM 360, our BIM collaboration and construction management tool and closely followed by Fusion our cloud-based design and fabrication tool. In addition to brand new customers to our cloud products, we are also doing a lot of add on business with our existing cloud customers. A great example of this was a large Australian construction company which had already deployed over a 1000 seats of BIM 360. The company is now expanding the deployment of BIM 360 and integrating it into their project management system which has resulted in the purchase of an additional 3000 seats of BIM 360 by that customer. BIM 360 goes beyond a typical product sale and has allowed us to develop much more strategic relationships with [indiscernible] and other companies as we kept into this huge potential TAM of the construction market, the fee in AEC. Some of you may have seen that just last week there was a great story in the Wall Street Journal that highlighted that opportunity and prominently featured Autodesk. Fusion 360 is also expanding our market opportunity. We had a great Q1 win with a UK-based engineering firm that is choosing to replace Team Center with Fusion Lifecycle. This customer also purchased product design collection, which includes Fusion 360 which successfully completed against DSO and PPP solutions. The more people used fusion, the more they are reinforcing our believe that Fusion is a game changer that's driving the future of making things at the expense of our competition. Partially offsetting the growth in subscription plan subs was the expected decline in maintenance plant sales. However, maintenance planned subs declined less than what we experienced in Q4 through a combination of a higher renewal rate and a smaller pool of renewal opportunities. As we stated in the past, we expect to see ongoing declines in maintenance plan subscriptions going forward. The rate of decline will vary based on the number of subscriptions that come up for renewal, the renewal rate at the time and our ability to incest maintenance planned customers to switch over to EBAs or product subscriptions without maintenance to subscription program.  I’ll now turn it over to Andrew to provide more details on the great results we saw in Q1.  Andrew Anagnost Thanks, Amar. The strong growth in total subscription is fueling growth in ARR. Subscription plan ARR surged 105% on a constant currency basis and reflect the strong uptake of all our subscription plan offerings. Total ARR grew by over 100 million quarter-over-quarter and 20% over Q1 last year on a constant currency basis. And I’ll point out this 40% of our total ARR is now driven by [technical difficulty] that’s up from just 23% in Q1 last year and a clear indicator of significant progress we're making. When we accelerated the transition away perpetual licenses two years ago. We projected the subscription plan ARR with maintenance plan during this fiscal year and we are well on the way to making that happen. For the second consecutive quarter, we experience the small sequential increase in total ARPS, primarily driven by ARPS growth in product subscription. It's still a little too early to project what ARPS will grow sequentially in Q2 and ARPS is still sensitive to short-term shifts and term length, geo mix, product mix and promotions. Having said that, we remain confident that ARPS will be positively influence in the second half of the year by less discounting and promotions to our legacy users, as well as the impact of the maintenance and subscription program. Each quarter, the vast majority of the subscription plan subs are added through traditional maintenance. However, we continue to make meaningful progress in converting non-paying users into subscribers. In Q1, we added 26,000 product subscriptions to another successful promo target in our legacy users. The Q1 promo offer 30% discount on a three-year subscription is they turn in their old perpetual licenses. It's the same type of promo that added 28,000 subs in Q1 last year with 70% discount. We’re still finding that more than half of those particularly in the promo are turning in licenses seven years back or older. This is further reinforcing our view, that there are meaningful number of active users whose licenses are more than five years old and are interested in moving to latest software. They are continuing to be over 2 million of these legacy users that are actively using our all perpetual license. Overtime, we will convert a large portion of these users either through promotions like this, compelling new product introductions or traditional means as their product becomes increasingly update overtime, we’re beginning to see this happen already. The other large cohort non-paying users, the non-compliance or piracy based of roughly 12 million worldwide. We’ve made significant gains and being able to more accurately identify these non-compliance users and we’re just getting underway with systemically pursue convergence to subscription. Driving more users to subscription directly aligned with another one of our transition related initiatives to drive more business direct. Total direct revenue for the first quarter was 30% of total revenue, that's up from 25% in Q1 last year and just 19% two years ago. We continue to grow the volume of business with our large enterprise customers and we’re experiencing exceptional growth of over 300% with our e-store. We expect to continue to meaningfully growth both our direct to enterprise and our e-store business as we go forward. Now I'll close my section by talking a little bit more about the maintenance and subscription program, because it was easily the most asked about topics over the past quarters. At the end of the Q1, we had nearly 2 million maintenance planned customers and we're going to encourage these customers to move to product subscriptions. We'd like them to do so sooner rather than later as product subscription provides them the great value with increased flexibility support and access to our cloud products. Moving to single model makes the more sense and we'll immensely simplify our customer's transactions with Autodesk. The M2S kicks off with maintenance planned customers that come up for renewal starting on June 1 which is just a couple of weeks away. Along with greater value, loyalty pricing will be a big driver. As I discussed last quarter, all maintenance customers will be subject to a 5% price increase when they come up to renewal and they can choose to move to product subscription for a loyalty discounts of 60% less than the cost of a new product subscription and lots of pricing for the following two years. With this discount will decreased by 5% for each of the following 2 years, so the earlier customers wish the more they'll save. The maintenance planned customer can choose to stay on maintenance, but they will be subject to a 10% increase next year and 20% increase the year after that. As such, we believe that there will be a relatively small number of maintenance planned customers by the end of FY'20 and we'll be determining the best course of actions for the subsequent renewal periods. Since we announce this program a couple of months ago, we have been working with our partners to help them better understand the program. We've also provided them with some extra tools that help drive positive conversations with customers and we are incentivizing the channel partners to up sell collections, which would further enhance their cash flow. We're not making projections [technical difficulty] will move over this year or next, but believe we will have a smaller pool of maintenance customers by the time we get to the end of our fiscal year '20. Now I'll turn it over to Scott for a closer look at some of the financials. Scott Herren Thanks Andrew. Once again, all of you should have the prepared remarks document, which is the best source for our financial details. So I'm not going to walk through all of them, but if you want to hit on a couple of noteworthy items, and then talk about our business outlook for fiscal 18.  Before I get into the numbers, I want to draw your attention to our new format for revenue reporting which greatly improves transparency. You'll now see 3 revenue lines, one for subscription, one for maintenance and one for license and other revenues. In this format, you'll no longer need the reconciliation table in our prepared remarks doc as all subscription revenue which we used to call new model will be reported in the subscription line and all maintenance revenue will be recorded in maintenance line. All remaining non-recurring revenue will be reported as license and other revenue. In this new format, quarterly subscription revenue times four equals subscription ARR and quarterly maintenance revenue times four equals to maintenance ARR and you'll be better able to isolate non-recurring revenues that will flow into the license and other revenue line. Note that one side effect in this change results in additional small legacy products being added into the ARR calculation. As a result, we have slightly adjusted the historical figures for ARR, so that you have an apples-to-apples comparison for our Q1 results in going forward.  This is an improvement we've been working on and many of you've been asking for the quite a while and I think we can all agree this is clear and more transparent. Moving to spend management, we're proud that we've been able to drive strong growth in all of our important transition metrics while reducing our Q1 non-GAAP spend by 3%. We know that some of you have been skeptical of our ability to grow our business while keeping spend flat this year and next year, but we continue to achieve our goals by making sure that we're investing in critical elements of our transition while reducing spend in other areas, driving efficiencies throughout the company and the best thing smaller non-core products. During the stage of our transition, deferred revenue is a better measure of our business than reported revenue. Deferred revenue grew 18% against the really tough compare last year, when we were still selling multi-year maintenance contracts. As you know with discontinued multi-year maintenance sales in conjunction with the launch of the maintenance subscription program. You’ll notice another new discloser we added this quarter for unbilled deferred revenue, which we define simply as revenue that has been contractually committed by our customers, but not yet billed and not included on balance sheet. Specifically driven by our multi-year large enterprise business agreements or EBAs. Historically, unbilled deferred revenue was an immaterial number, but as we move forward this year. We’re planning or moving more of our enterprise customers to annual billings with the contract, which are typically three-year commitments. We are providing visibility for unbilled deferred revenue to give you a more holistic view on our quarterly results. We remained aggressive with our stock buyback plan in Q1 and repurchased 2.2 million shares for a total of $192 million and that averages out to a little over $85 per share. The downside of our stock price at this level is we’re not able to buyback quite as many shares, but we remain committed to offsetting dilution from our equity plans and reducing our share count over China. Overall, our strong Q1 results increased our confidence with the transition is working for our customers and our partners, it also sets us up for success for the rest of the year and reinforces our conviction in our fiscal ’20 targets. Turning to our outlook our view of the global economic conditions remains consistent with our view of the past several quarters, but most of the mature markets performing relatively well and little change in emerging markets. As we look at our outlook for the second quarter, we expect a seasonal decrease in subscriptions additions in Q2 consistent with what we’ve seen in the last two years. In the Q1 sub ads have added benefit from a seasonally strong EBAs solid prior quarter and the legacy promo. However, we're pleased with our execution in the current business trends and have confidence in our ability to drive results, we’re taking appropriately conservative approach and leaving the full year fiscal ’18 outlook unchanged at this point. Finally, I want to provide an update on our CEO transition. The board is currently in the process of vetting external candidates, as well as both Andrew and Amar. We don’t have any other update on the CEO selection process, other than to say it's a top priority for the board and is progressing as plan. In the meantime, we continue to execute very well through the transition and Andrew and Amar have the board’s full confident to lead the company to ongoing success. To wrap things up, we’ve executed well over the past several quarters and we are looking forward to building on this through fiscal 2018 and work toward our fiscal ’20 goals and beyond. Operator, we’d now like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you’d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it.  Andrew Anagnost Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year. Mark Grant Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.  Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase. So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway. We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software. That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.  Saket Kalia Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we’re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward? Andrew Anagnost This is Andrew, I’m going to take that one. Saket Kalia Sure. Andrew Anagnost As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it’s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it’s emerging in mature markets. And what we’ve said consistently and we’re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we’re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we’re not changing, we’re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we’re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that’s going and trend that up a bit. You’re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it’s going to put upward pressure on that. We’re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you’re going to see that. But you’re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we’re more successful in the cloud, you’re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we’re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half. Saket Kalia Got it. That’s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others? Amarpreet Hanspal Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we’re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we’re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in.  So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they’re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we’re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we’re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year? Andrew Anagnost Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both.  Amarpreet Hanspal Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers. So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.  Jay Vleeschhouwer  Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year? Andrew Anagnost All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we’re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going.  I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we’re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It’s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we’re actually really happy where we’re at. The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that’s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that’s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you’re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we’re exactly where we select to these. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you’d see in your maintenance is? Scott Herren Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn’t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don’t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year.  Keith Weiss Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore? Andrew Anagnost Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior. Amarpreet Hanspal Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around. Keith Weiss To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible]. Amarpreet Hanspal Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question. Keith Weiss So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that? Amarpreet Hanspal Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability.  Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.  Gregg Moskowitz  Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions. Scott Herren Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. Amarpreet Hanspal Go ahead sorry. Gregg Moskowitz  Sorry Amar, go ahead.  Amarpreet Hanspal I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it’s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you’re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you’ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that? Andrew Anagnost Look, we’re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we’re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It’s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we’re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering. The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that’s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we’re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we’re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We’re going to continue to do it and we’re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will. Amarpreet Hanspal One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn’t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we’re seeing the promo work, we’re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we’re doing well with that opportunity. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup. Ken Wong Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully? Scott Herren I don’t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it’s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don’t see that driving any particular bump and extends.  Ken Wong Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical? Scott Herren Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers.  Scott Herren So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer. And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection.  Amarpreet Hanspal This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there? Andrew Anagnost Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn’t come down to maintenance versus subscription. They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription.  Amarpreet Hanspal Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward. Unidentified Analyst If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted? Andrew Anagnost No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it’s really uniform and it’s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it’s playing out exactly the same way and we’re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I’m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you’re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you’re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal ’20 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers? Andrew Anagnost So I’m going to answer part of that and then I’m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we’ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we’ve told them, they’re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It’s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it’s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don’t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program. Scott Herren Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it’s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that. Steve Koenig May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance. Scott Herren Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don’t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those. Andrew Anagnost We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can.  Steve Koenig Sounds good. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front? Scott Herren Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It’s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend? Amarpreet Hanspal So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward. Ken Talanian Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more? Scott Herren Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription. Ken Talanian Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections? Scott Herren EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Monika Garg  I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we’re seeing is, we’re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we’ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people. The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we’re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings. When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing.  Amarpreet Hanspal Monika, I just [indiscernible], we’ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves. Monika Garg  Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost The one, so I could say we don’t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that’s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we’re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we’ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types. Monika Garg  Thank you so much. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. We’ll be at the JP Morgan conference in Boston next Tuesday and the Canaccord one-on-one conference in Toronto next Thursday. We’ll be at the Berenberg and the NASDAQ conferences in London on June 14th and 15th respectively. And last we will be hosting investor and analyst at AU London on June 21, so please let me if you'd like to be attending that event as well. So for anything else you can reach me at 415-507-6033. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Our first question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant Hi, thanks. This is Mark Grant on for Heather. Just a quick one for me. Are you mentioned that the maintenance renewals were a little bit better in the quarter than you’d seen in recent trends? Was there a possibility in the quarter that you had maintenance renewal kind of pulled forward customers coming forward and trying to renew maintenance ahead of the maintenance to subscription transition? And then quick follow-up to that is on the full year guidance of, reason for not raising the full year guidance for such a great quarter? Amarpreet Hanspal Yes. So on the maintenance question, maintenance was better than expected really. I think we had a small group of renewals and I think most of our customers who renewed were trying to line-up with the maintenance to subscription transactions. We didn't see any unnatural pull forward into the quarter. And it was better than expected and we expect to continue to do well with the renewal rates because we paying a lot of attention to it.  Andrew Anagnost Yes, and on the second part of your question the full year guide. we've executed well over the last several quarters and certainly executed well in Q1. That's giving us increased confidence as both the transition is working for our customers, but it's also working for our partners and we feel good about where we are at this point in the year, but there is long way to go. It's 90 days into a full year at this point, I think it's appropriate to be prudent with the guide for the full year. Mark Grant Great. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.  Philip Winslow Hey, thanks guys and congrats on a what was at those Q1. Question for Andrew and Scott, going back to the maintenance because, obviously, just overall subscriber count growth was well ahead of people's expectations and the maintenance decline was definitely less than what we were expecting. Curious [technical difficulty] obviously, there are a lot of changes going on pricing, but wondering if you can comment on just the feedback you're getting from customers and sort of the early thoughts on sort of how you expect this to play out. I know you're not getting specific guidance, but maybe kind a help us walk us through and how you're hearing and how you're thinking about that? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Phil, let me talk to it. So first off, let me remind you how structured this program so we can put some of the feedback in context. It's a multi-year program, we've rolled out 3 years' worth of changes in the customer base, so that they could actually get a lot of visibility to what they could expect over the next few years. The first year is modest price increases, the program starts June 1 and you're going to see a 5% price increase. So whether you are a maintenance customers that really wants to see in maintenance or wants to move to subscription now, you're really going to renew and move forward and take -- you're going to take an action, a positive actions. Because you got a year ahead to think about it. And what we're going to be doing in that year is we're going to be collecting the customer reaction and we're also going to be demonstrating to the customers more explicitly why there is more value in the subscription world. The value is going to show up just the nature of the offering, we just talk about access controlling insights. We're also going to be adding a lot more value related to bringing the cloud much closer to the subscription offering. So we give the customers lots of runway. We expected there was going to be different types of reaction at the program, which is one of the reasons why we built in this year for people to digest what we're doing. So as we've rolled it out we've gotten reaction from some of our larger customers whether we're just looking at it and they're going, we were going to move to subscriptions anyway or we're going to move to an EPA. So we're going to probably move forward with a lowest price possible. Our smaller customers are where we've gotten the most noise. And essentially, they're concerned about losing access to their perpetual software. That's why we got the one year cooling off period for us to absorb this feedback, for us to engage with these customers and for us to really prove to them that not only are they moving to a better higher value offering but we're going to protect them as they move forward. So that's where we're at right now, and I wouldn't expect anything else to change. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.  Saket Kalia Actually, maybe I'll start with you Scott. So, subscription ARPS, to the point earlier saw at second quarter of sequential growth here. You've talked about this being a little bit of a volatile metric, because of the mix in the past. You see like we’re getting some point, where some of the higher price subscriptions or really having a structural impact on the ARPS number. Where we could see a little bit more stability in that metric going forward? Andrew Anagnost This is Andrew, I’m going to take that one. Saket Kalia Sure. Andrew Anagnost As we said, this metric is highly sensitive to mix, it’s highly sensitive not only in the product mix, but also the geo mix, whether it’s emerging in mature markets. And what we’ve said consistently and we’re sticking to it, is that we move into the second half of the year, we’re going to start to see that metric trend up. And we’re not changing, we’re not changing that guidance. I want to remind you thought about some of the things that are going to keep pushing that up. One, we’re going to be absorbing that maintenance to subscription price increased, the 5% that pushes into the ecosystem, so that’s going and trend that up a bit. You’re also going to see some core price increases and the moved to collections, it’s going to put upward pressure on that. We’re also going to see the decreasing discount, remember with the discount just around a fraction of what it was in previous years on our legacy programs, you’re going to see that. But you’re also going to see the mix in mature and emerging change, which is going to puts some positive pressure. As we’re more successful in the cloud, you’re going to see downward pressure. So those are the factors that are going to be affecting this, as we move it to the second half of the year, but we’re holding to the statement we made previously, you are going to see a trend up as we move to the second half. Saket Kalia Got it. That’s really helpful. And then my follow-up, maybe for you Amar. It sounds like in some of your prepared commentary, that some of the competitive wins, sounds like just a little bit stronger this quarter. Can you just talk maybe qualitatively about any competitive metrics that you look out whether that's win rates or competitive conversions? Talk to us a little bit about maybe how you feel competitively this quarter maybe versus others? Amarpreet Hanspal Saket, great question, thanks. We definitely feeling the positive about how we’re position in the industry and how they driving change. Our investment of strategy of using the cloud to drive a new paradigm and look billing industry, as well as manufacturing industry is really paying off. In manufacturing in particular with Fusion and the changes we’re driving and getting industrial additive manufacturing and causes by genetic design, customers are really paying a lot of attention and adopting those ideas from us in a big way. And in many cases at the expense of our competition, in fact many of our Fusion 360 wins this quarter, in fact in an increasing rate are coming and the expense of our competition. Leaving sort of old, 20-year old [indiscernible] CAD systems and starting to adopt the paradigm we've putting forward with Fusion, which connects CAD to CAM to CAE [ph], with data management build-in.  So in manufacturing we really feel like the customer is searching for the next paradigm and they’re starting to really turn to Fusion and adopt it in response to that. Likewise, in the building industry, the big several competitive push that in success that we’re seeing is really in construction. I would say, actually a major competitor has been paid for in some ways that they are moving from an analog to a digital ways of working, and we've been leading the way in using cloud and mobile to drive a construction management and BIM management process for those customers. So definitely we’re feeling both of those factors and manufacturing construction growing at a really fast pace, we feel very good about where we're positioned in both industries. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst Thanks guys, it's Jack [indiscernible] on for Sterling tonight. Couple of questions from us, the first being in the revenue by product family, looks like AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT actually grew year-over-year as far as the major segments are concerned. Any particular reason that that return to growth in the quarter whereas AEC and manufacturing are still down year-over-year? Andrew Anagnost Yeah, Jack. When you look at that you've got to reflect back what was happened in Q1 and year ago. It was our first quarter without selling any perpetual licenses on AutoCAD and LT. And you remember when we ended the sale at the end of the prior quarter in Q4 there were some buy ahead activities. So with AutoCAD and LT Q1 a year ago, so the compare point was a little bit artificially low with some demand pulled backward into the prior year. That's part of what contributed to it, I would say we're seeing very strong uptick though for both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT, and the LT family with product subscription. So it's a combination of both.  Amarpreet Hanspal Right, and what I'd actually was Scott you said it's one of the, we're seeing subscription working everywhere around the world. One of the geographies which really did well for us sequentially is APAC. And APAC has all is been a strong contributor to the AutoCAD and LT results and that's sort of reflected in the numbers you're seeing. The other thing I would say, you made a comment about AEC and manufacturing, I would just take this opportunity to say, in manufacturing one other thing is going on is a [indiscernible] business moved from a perpetual license business to a subscription business over these quarters and that sort of reflected in those numbers. So I would say that manufacturing numbers be a downward trend of that is exaggerated because of that shift of revenue upfront from readable, but performing strongly across all industries, we feel very good about where we are. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. thank you. And then actually since you mentioned geographies for my follow up, it appears that at least on revenue basis year-over-year Americas did a little bit better than the other major geographies. Is that also true as far as bookings are concerned, or was there just a little bit of some noise in the revenue for the regions? Andrew Anagnost Yeah Jack, we actually did well in all regions. I think it's one thing to look at it year-over-year, if you look at it sequentially, we actually did well in Americas, in Europe and in APAC and as Amar just pointed out, actually it seem to have at least on the bottom in APAC and don't have the same headwind that we had for most of the year last year there. So it does nothing that stands out that was particularly strong or particularly weak in any of the 3GOs, it was good performance across the board. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Griffin Securities.  Jay Vleeschhouwer  Question number one, perhaps for Andrew and Amar is, if you could talk about the role of distribution or distributors in the future. Have you see their roles in terms of fulfillments license management, et cetera? And as well could you talk about the effects of any past or perspective pricing changes if you put through distribution. In other words, you've changed the pricing for bars looking to purchase directly from the company versus perhaps more favorable pricing let's say, big buy to distribution instead. And then secondly, in the first quarter, it would appear that collections, have you seen in the direct business where a smaller percentage of the business than the former suites had been. Could you verify that and how are you thinking about the progression of collection as percentage of the business as you go through the rest of the year? Andrew Anagnost All right. So Jay, that was a multi-part question. So let me go through each one of these, one at a time. So look when it comes to bars and distribution in our future, let's be very quick. Our business is going to be bigger and the size of the pie that the bars we’re going to get the size of the business, if they're going to be able to participate will be bigger as well. We are going to be doing to be doing more business direct through major accounts and direct to the e-store, but we are absolutely going to be providing a bigger business to our indirect partners as well as we move forward. Now your question with regarding the pricing to [indiscernible] things like that. We are constantly evolving and changing our frameworks and changing the pricing and the things that go through the framework to optimize where the things are going.  I'm not going to comment on any specific pricing strategy we put out there in the system, but we’re always doing that to optimize how we distribute and deliver the software and the customers. I mean your last question is about collections. So first, I would talk about where is the overall strategy going with collections. It’s absolutely our goal to ensure that our new customers are moving to collections versus buying standalone products. And as you know we light up the main subscription program in June, there is going to be a major push to move those customers over that collections. Those activities are brewing and gestational right now. But with regards to collection results, we’re actually really happy where we’re at. The volume runway in Q1 is equivalent to suites run rate in the same period a year ago and that’s exactly where we want to be. In the short period of time, we basically gotten back up to that runway and that’s like where we should be. But as we move forward into the year, you’re going to see collections contribution go up more and more and throughout the year. But right now we’re exactly where we select to these. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Keith Weiss Excellent. Nice quarter guys and thank you for taking the questions. I just wondering if you could talk a little bit about better renewal rates on the main side of equations. I wondering if you could give us any sort of viewpoint on sort of the renewal rates on the new model such as the subscription subject if you will, get a little time under your belt. How are those coming in and particularly how to those look relatively to sort of what you’d see in your maintenance is? Scott Herren Yes. The renewal rates was strong across the board, I mean the product subscription rates were right in line with our expectations. It doesn’t compare maintenance to product subscriptions, I mean, one thing that keep in mind is, one of the benefits of the product subscription is customers switch things on and off and some on monthly and some on quarterly subscribers. So you don’t really get the new rates of by subscription types, but we are pleased with where product subscriptions ended up and this continues to be a big focus area for us for remainder of the year.  Keith Weiss Got it. And then my second question. I mean to continue in the line of question that Jay was going down on the reseller channel. Now they were fully on a subscription model. Can you tell us a little bit about sort of what the incentives and what is the incentive program look like for the channel and broad stocks? Is that on ARR, is it on subscription. Give us some any indication of where you took that now that it's not going to be kind of a revenue base model anymore? Andrew Anagnost Actually no. This is Andrew. So the incentives we put into the systems for partners are aligned with the kind of outcomes we want with subscriptions. For example, we're obviously going to incent them to encourage the customer to look at collection, because obviously that's something we've really want the customer to consider and we think that's the right path for them moving forward and best path for the future. So we also want them send adoption and renewal activity, so we actually putting incentives into the system do ensure that the partners are making sure that the customers are actually using the software because like Amar said, when you're on a subscription model, you can start and stop if you want, so we want the partners to guarantee that the customers are actually adopting things. we put incentives into the system like that to drive that kind of behavior. Amarpreet Hanspal Yeah I agree and keep that just add to that overtime, you see us continuing to optimize our incentive structure to drive the kind of results and the outcomes that we want. Subscriptions obviously is a big focus for us right now driving collections is a big focus for us right now. And since I've been making sure that our renewal rates are right where we want it to be in and then we're using our classic combination of front and backend discounts to get those results. And as Jay's earlier comment with the distribution channel that's another place where we've been sort of just optimizing our relationships and our incentive structure to get the right results again to drive this overall recurring revenue and subscription business that we are getting the channel oriented around. Keith Weiss To be absolutely clear, I mean, is it fair to say that in terms of whether or not a partner hit plan or not point quarter if you will. Did ARR reached base revenues or is it just there is a whole collection of things they [indiscernible]. Amarpreet Hanspal Can you say that again ARR and then we lost the second part of the question. Keith Weiss So in terms of sort of like from a headline number per partners you guys have done do business reviews. Is there a version of a quarter, like when they hit plan does ARR replace whether revenue used to be, they used to have to hit the revenue target, now they are at ARR target or is it little bit complicated in that? Amarpreet Hanspal Our engagements with partner is very simple, we talk about billings numbers with them and building outcomes with them and the annualized contract value. We don't try to do ARR compensation models with our partner channel, that would be far too complicated for them to not only engage with, but actually for them to measure and react to. So we keep that very simple because we want to their transactional ability.  Operator Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen & Company.  Gregg Moskowitz  Okay thanks very much and good afternoon guys. Wondering if you could add any commentary on the mix of LT subscriptions this quarter as compared with both AutoCAD and the AutoCAD Vertical subscriptions. Scott Herren Yeah hi Gregg. LT continues to be the volume part of the business, as it did was in the perpetual license world it is in the product subscription world. We're not seeing a significant shift in the mix of LT either going at a higher percent on a volume basis on a lower percent, LT and AutoCAD kind a continue to hold serve at the level they were. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. Amarpreet Hanspal Go ahead sorry. Gregg Moskowitz  Sorry Amar, go ahead.  Amarpreet Hanspal I think we saw product strength across all products including the Verticals as well as the Vertical product the two new Vertical products, there wasn't a single standout product that was driving -- these all strength across the board. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay, perfect. And then just a question for Andrew, find it’s really interesting that you got essentially the same amount of legacy on subscriber conversions this quarter, at a 30% discount as you did a year ago at 70% discount and that you’re still seeing half of the conversions at an aging that in seven years or older. So the question is in the past you’ve spoken about a 30% conversion rate of licensees that were five years older or less. Is there any reason why the conversion percentage can be a lot of higher than that? Andrew Anagnost Look, we’re going to continue to convert very highly rates, let's make sure that we’re clear on exactly how are going to be converting the customers, because the promo are only one measure of our conversion success. It’s a three pronged strategy we are looking at to bring the customers in. One is the pace of functionality that we update in the existing products, so is the ecosystem become very much out of date, very quickly for the customers that stay off the current release. The other aspects of the things that we’re doing is entangling the cloud value so deeply in the subscription offering, that the customers are really compelled to get that value captured and integrated in their processes. More and more the cloud offerings are going to becomes super critical to what our customers do and that's going to get deeply entangling into the subscription offering. The last bit was these legacy promos and these offerings that we use. These are not the -- that’s not the absolute measure of legacy conversion, just the fact that we’re doing the kinds of net ads, but you see here means that we’re dipping into these non-subscriber's basis. We’re going to continue to do it and we’re going to continue to do it at reasonable rates and I think the program is working exactly as we said that it will. Amarpreet Hanspal One of the things that we have peace with is that, we didn’t have to discount aggressively to get the kind of sub results that we saw. And as Andrew mentioned, I mean, I think as some ways the net as number is becoming a better indicator, how where we are converting our overall opportunity than any individual promotion to reach the second [indiscernible] base. As Andrew said, at some level there is a network affecting being built as our new products rollout and customers want to be current and many of the sales select into the buying and use subscription to be current. So I think overall, we’re seeing the promo work, we’re seeing usually net sales is go up, because of the new product subscribing. So I think we’re doing well with that opportunity. Gregg Moskowitz  Okay. That’s great. Thank you. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong with Citigroup. Ken Wong Scott, I know you guys mentioned flat total spend for the year. But how should we think about the trajectory of sales and marketing, once you guys launch the maintenance to subs program. Would that tick up meaningfully? Scott Herren I don’t think so, Ken. You saw that for the first quarter, we actually posted a decline in spend of about 3% during Q1. Obviously for us to be flat for the year, it’s not going to stay minus 3% throughout the year. So I would expect to see slight increases going forward, but that still comes in flat for the year. And there is no particular swing between categories as we rollout maintenance to subscriptions. Maintenance to subs is obviously a huge focus, both of our sales team for our channel. But I don’t see that driving any particular bump and extends.  Ken Wong Okay. Got it. And then just a follow-up on just receivables. So it was, I guess it was count pretty good amount from what it was last year. Can you remind us something last year drive up accounts receivable collections much more than typical? Scott Herren Yes. What drives receivables of course is linear in the quarter. What get sold during the quarter in the last month because we in most cases, we bill in that 30. So we had a very linear quarter this quarter if you look at our DSOs this quarter, they were below 45, I think 43 days, whereas last quarter it was a much more backend loaded quarter. So you just think of linearity during the quarter as nothing else that's happened that would skew that one way or the another. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan from Bank of America. Your line is now open.  Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is Shanker for Kash thanks for letting me ask question, and congrats on the good results. I have a question on the maintenance conversion. So my understand is that if the maintenance customers currently using LT or AutoCAD product, he would most slightly shift to an LT or AutoCAD products in subscription it's in the customer convert. So in that context if you can you elaborate how -- discount you're offering, how else are you incentivizing the customer to adopt collections? From a geographical mix as well how customers.  Scott Herren So the mainly, the way the program is structured is that, the customer that's moving at the time can move like-for-like they can move LT to LT or AutoCAD to AutoCAD but they're never going to get a better price to move to a collection than they will at that point. The discount on collection that they get is the same 60% discount they get moving for like-for-like. So there is a strong incentive in the system especially for an AutoCAD customer to consider a collection. Probably less so for an LT customer but definitely for an AutoCAD customer. And what we've done as we've armed our partner channels all across the world we basically tool that let them sit down with the customers and say hey, here are your options, here is what happens if you move now, here is what happened if you move next year. And by the way, if you move to a collection this is the price you lock in and this is the value you get with regards to the product offerings. So we put a lot of work into educating the channel in particular and how to have a conversation with the customer in terms of moving up to a collection.  Amarpreet Hanspal This is simply our partners know how to do, and this is a one -- it's not just incentive for the customers, our partners really take advantage of this one-time opportunity to move their customers to a higher recurring revenue base, and I think they're really focused on that opportunity right now. Unidentified Analyst Got it. Just a follow up question, you mentioned above the smaller customers having an issue with the subscription plan and you're working with them. Could you elaborate the feedback they received on potential price increases that could happen post fiscal '20? Are there any pushbacks on that or what the strategy there? Andrew Anagnost Like I said, the feedback the negative feedback we've got was exactly what we've expected. When you announce to a customer that their maintenance prices are going up over a three-year period. You expect to get some feedback that's not necessarily positive. It has primarily been from the smaller customers and when you look at their main issue, it's doesn’t come down to maintenance versus subscription. They recognize that the program we've put in place puts reasonable price increases for them and they get they love the royalty program. What they are worried about is giving up their perpetual license. So what we are just we're just next year and the by the way it is over this next year. Because they're obviously going to renew at a 5% increase is essentially show the customers that they need small accounts, that moving to a subscription is a more valuable path for them and something that helps them accomplish what they need to do more effectively. We're committed to doing that and that's really going to be the essence of our response to these customers is delivering the value they're expecting to see and helping them understand exactly what they get when they move to subscription.  Amarpreet Hanspal Well I think one thing you noticed in talking to our partners. when we first announced this program and like got a much of reaction And then as our customers started talking to our partners. I mean a lot of that concern has started to going down, because of all the thing that Andrew said, that our customers are starting to understand better, the value proposition or subscription and kind of pricing one that we're putting in. And so I think that there was a little bit of component, we maybe an upstream, but that is really starting to new and customers are much more comfortable with the path that we have put forward. Unidentified Analyst If I may just ask one more, this as a follow-up to that. Is there any difference in the geography versus U.S. versus Europe versus Asia is there any difference and how customers reacted? Andrew Anagnost No. The reactions fairly uniformed. I mean, obviously you get some smaller variations, but it’s really uniform and it’s very similar to the reaction we got when we announced the end of perpetual. So it’s playing out exactly the same way and we’re going to go to the exact in process. But there is no particular geography or country that show any propensity to be concerned. Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush Securities. Steve Koenig I’m going to turn to bunch the two questions maybe at ones, because they're kind of related. So I guess first, to what extent are your plans for the discount that you'll offer on subscriptions done at the M2S program next year and the year after. Are those pretty much hard wire or might you change those? And kind of the related question is, I understand you’re not prepared to give the guide yet on the M2S program, the volumes that you will get out of the M2S program and that sensible that you’re not ready yet to do that. But to what extent -- can you give us color on to what extent to your fiscal ’20 targets depend on the price increases that you will effectively get from the maintenance customers and the converting customers? Andrew Anagnost So I’m going to answer part of that and then I’m going to let Scott speak to the other part of it. So with regard to the maintenance subscription program, look we’ve rolled out the program. We created visibility, we’ve told them, they’re getting a 60% discount, that discount goes down by 5% every year as they -- depending on what year they move. It’s our intend to stick to that program and stick to that program, we think it’s an excellent program, it's an excellent level of discount. There is really no reason to change that. So I don’t anticipate any change in the actual rules of the program. Scott Herren Yes. I hear you that Steve. And so your second question, there is interesting effect, if you look at the price increases filled into maintenance to subscription. The longest someone stays on maintenance, of course they incur higher price increases, the more they contribute to ARR. So there is a bit of a reverse, it’s a big counter inclusive. There is no dependency on a very rapid shift over, in fact the slower it goes actually boost ARR a bit as it moves along. So there is no significant dependency model on that. Steve Koenig May I clarity than Scott. Have you assumed in your long-term guide, a rapid, fairly rapid shift over, so there is fairly minimal price boost, or there is the long-term guidance require that significant number of customers stay on maintenance. Scott Herren Yes. Our long-term targets do assume that it shifts over and that the majority do shift over, but I don’t want to get into any of the details on what that looks like, I said there is an interesting play in terms of the rate and pace, that they move in the effective house [ph] in the model. As with most of the metrics in the models, Steve, we try to be somewhat conservative on those. Andrew Anagnost We have a clear goal to get as much of that maintenance phase moved over to subscription by FY '20 as we possibly can.  Steve Koenig Sounds good. Thank you.  Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Talanian from Evercore ISI. Ken Talanian So you had a nice down tick in expenses in this quarter, and I was wondering if you could walk us through some of your key initiatives to continue to contain expenses. What elements might cause you to perform better than your current guidance on that front? Scott Herren Sure just to be clear, we typically always see a sequential down tick in spend from Q4 to Q1. Q4, as yearend, there is a lot of the true ups that happened on variable compensation plans on commissions. It’s a quarter that we have our AU events which also drives our expense. So the normal seasonality you'd expect to decline from Q4 to Q1, the rate of that decline in some ways depends on how successful we were in the prior year because submissions are not an insignificant part of that decline. So it's not a -- while it is a sequential decline and it's not unexpected sequential decline from Q4 to Q1. Amar if you want to touch on how we're managing spend? Amarpreet Hanspal So Ken, what I'd add is that outlook for the year on spend is being unchanged because we've instituted operational rigor and discipline and continue to make very hard choices in investing in the right areas to drive the transition and divest in sort of non-core projects and non-core activities and just keep a tight focus on managing spends. So our outlook for the year is unchanged and I think we're making all the right decisions in terms of ensuring that the transition remains on track. And some of the things like we decided to divest, we had a bunch of consumer products for example last year, that are not material to the transition we make choices like volume [ph] divest, and that's giving us some of the fuel we need to keep driving the transition forward. Ken Talanian Okay, great. And there is a follow up, I realized it's early, but could you give us a sense to how to think about what the price increase is might look like in the years following the initial three-year subscription discount that folks will be locking in? Will it mean -- directionally could you expect it be on par with the subscription price, absent that discount or might it even be more? Scott Herren Ken, we've been very explicit at the program where the customer pops up to the terminal discount price of the program. So the main subscription program lasts three years, and at the end of that third year, there is a particular discount. That's the price that everybody trues up to when they exit the program. Which by the way is the right thing to do with regard to incenting the customer to not only give up their perpetual license, but feel comfortable with the move to subscription. Ken Talanian Okay. And is that for EBAs as well or just product in collections? Scott Herren EBAs are a totally different process. So when customer moves to EBA, they've moved off of maintenance to a consumption model. Remember, when you go for all of these things, with regards to the way we've rolled out the prices, the way we manage the price increases at the terminal point. Our goal is to maximize the value of that maintenance base and that is all about minimizing the churn out of those customers during that base. We feel like we've created a program that balances both the price uplift and the churn factors that guide us and maximizing the value of that base, that's what's driving all of this.  Operator  Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Monika Garg with Pacific Crest. Monika Garg  I guess first question, one which we get quite often is that. Looking at it, it seems like a low gross market, but your target of 20% subscription growth means, you need to add somewhere between 850,000 to 900,000 new subscriptions ever year. So can you maybe walk through the math to achieve that? Andrew Anagnost Yes. There is a fundamental thing we've been telling the people over and over again with regards to how this [technical difficulty]. First off, the move to subscription is reset the price points for design software pretty dramatically. So what we’re seeing is, we’re seeing increased demand for our offering, just by virtue of the fact that upfront costs are some much lower. Then there is a couple of other factors that play out here in terms of hitting those long-term subscription targets. One is the non-subscriber base we’ve been talking about over and over again throughout the last few years, those customers are moving forward. The other, which is a 2 million plus based of people. The other base is the 12 million pirate based that is going that move from pirated software to subscriptions, we know, we understand that base, we know they're moving forward. But the more important factor as we look over a five-year period. Is the market expansion, we’re going to see with the delivery of the cloud applications in both construction and manufacturing. The move to the cloud, especially in the manufacturing space starting to share shift away from our competitors to our offerings. When you add all of those things together, the 20% of subscription growth target is quite achievable and is achievable not only from growing off our existing core, but expanding into these new markets in construction and manufacturing.  Amarpreet Hanspal Monika, I just [indiscernible], we’ve always been the volume leader in the industries that serve and we continue to do that, we continue to drive as Andrew said share shift now increasingly manufacturing from traditional CADscan [ph] systems over to new cloud based disruptive system like Fusion and with the adoption of construction solutions they all expand our opportunity. And so in combination with the [indiscernible] compliance, with legacy opportunity and just the organic volume we see through job growth in the industries, I think we feel, we remain confident in our goals that we set ourselves. Monika Garg  Perfect. Thanks. And then as a follow-up. Could you share the split of subscription between EBAs, cloud and product subs? Thank you. Andrew Anagnost The one, so I could say we don’t give it at that level of granularity, the one number we have shared is the number of EBA subscription in this quarter was 44,000. And that’s really -- we sold above EBAs [ph] in Q4, you watched how they get used and adopted, or how many uses in those accounts adopt are EBA solutions and then sort of 90 days later we count the subscription. So that number was 44,000. At this point we’re not prepared to breakout cloud and product subs. But look as we’ve said, our strategy is working, our business monetization, platform transition is working, subscription is working everywhere. So we saw strength across all of those subscription types. Monika Garg  Thank you so much. Operator  Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn things back over David Gennarelli for any closing comments. David Gennarelli Thanks, operator. We’ll be at the JP Morgan conference in Boston next Tuesday and the Canaccord one-on-one conference in Toronto next Thursday. We’ll be at the Berenberg and the NASDAQ conferences in London on June 14th and 15th respectively. And last we will be hosting investor and analyst at AU London on June 21, so please let me if you'd like to be attending that event as well. So for anything else you can reach me at 415-507-6033. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation for attending today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Operator Good morning. My name is Stephanie and I\'ll be your conference operator. At this time, I\'d like to welcome everyone to ADP\'s First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Stephanie. Good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\'s Vice President, Investor Relations. And I\'m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\'s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I also want to highlight for you that the quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings for our reportable segment is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website. These schedules have been updated to include the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and have been adjusted to align with recent changes in our segment reporting to align our financial reporting with how management now views the business. Most notably, effective this quarter, we are now allocating stock-based compensation to the segments and have made some changes to the allocation methodology for certain corporate level allocations. Accordingly, prior periods presented have been restated and our segment guidance reflects the impact of these changes. Before Carlos begins, I\'d like to remind everyone that today\'s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our first quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 7% to $2.9 billion, despite 1 percentage point of combined pressure from foreign currency translation and the impact of the sale of the AdvancedMD business at the end of our fiscal 2016 first quarter. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was in line with our expectations. And we continue to see the benefits from our recent new business bookings helping to drive growth in the quarter. In addition to this solid revenue growth, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 per share. Overall, our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter and we are very pleased with our results. There were a number of contributing factors to our strong earnings performance. Jan will walk through these shortly. On the new business bookings front, during the quarter, we were flat compared to the first quarter of 2016, which was in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast 4% to 6% bookings growth for the year. I want to remind you of the tailwinds we experienced in fiscal 2016 from the sale of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act. Our anticipated fiscal 2017 performance, if achieved, would lead to a three-year compounded annual growth rate of 9%, which remains in line with our long-term new business bookings guidance of 8% to 10%. Overall, our revenue growth was solid this quarter. And while we do not expect all of the margin expansion we saw this quarter to continue through the remainder of the year, we are pleased with our overall results. Before I continue, I wanted to share a little more insight regarding retention. During the quarter, we experienced a decline in retention of 100 basis points, which was due to the loss of a contract pertaining to our CHSA business, which we announced today has been sold to WageWorks. Excluding the impact of this single client loss, retention would have been flat in the quarter. We continue to see the benefits of our efforts to upgrade clients to the most appropriate strategic cloud-based platforms. These upgrade efforts remain on track and progressed nicely during the quarter. As I just mentioned, today, we announced that WageWorks was acquiring two non-strategic ADP businesses; namely, our CHSA and COBRA businesses, for $235 million. In selling to a top-tier provider in these markets, we believe this agreement will truly unlock the potential of these businesses, while allowing us to sharpen our focus on ADP\'s core benefits administration offering. In conjunction with these dispositions, ADP entered into a partnership with WageWorks that will allow us to continue offering their COBRA and CHSA solutions to ADP clients in an integrated fashion. This is a great example of ADP continuing to build an ecosystem of complementary services that allow clients to extend the value of their core ADP Human Capital Management solutions. Last quarter, we shared details of our Service Alignment Initiative, which is part of our strategy to simplify the service organization by aligning ADP service operations to our strategic platforms. In addition to improving the client service experience, this initiative is expected to enhance ADP\'s service capabilities and contribute to operating efficiencies over the long-term. We are pleased with the progress we are making at our new strategic locations in Maitland, Florida, and Norfolk, Virginia. Efforts to staff and operate from these locations have commenced and are proceeding according to plan. We will soon announce the location of our third new site in the Western part of the U.S., which we anticipate being operational toward the latter part of this fiscal year. Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are receiving a wealth of external recognition. Recently, we shared that ADP was named a Leader in Payroll Business Process Outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner\'s study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision. In naming ADP a Leader, Gartner recognized us for combining a clear view of the markets\' direction and a deep understanding of client needs with the capabilities and expertise to deliver against them. Payroll outsourcing is core to who we are and is part of delivering outstanding HCM solutions. We are extremely proud of the sustained recognition for our leadership in this area. Today, ADP is delivering HCM solutions to more than 650,000 clients and 39 million employees worldwide. These data points are important for a number of reasons. They clearly demonstrate our unique reach and marketplace success over a sustained period of time. But they also represent a unique differentiator for ADP. The scale and the data that this client base represents allows us to deliver a suite of new capabilities that we believe hold the potential to transform the strategic value of the HR function. Because we pay one in six workers in the U.S., we are in the unique position to deliver advanced analytics capabilities that can help clients address workforce productivity, talent development, and retention. Leveraging this data, we introduced the ADP DataCloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. And today, more than 3,200 clients are using our analytics platform. About a year ago, we introduced benchmarking to this platform. The benchmarking capability provides users with a unique competitive advantage by delivering insight from actual live data to help clients evaluate their workforce against other companies in their market space. Our benchmarking capability puts key industry workforce metrics at our clients\' fingertips, avoiding the inherent time lag or inaccuracy associated with salary and other types of survey-based data. A few weeks ago, at the HR Technology Conference in Chicago, we received two distinctive recognitions for our DataCloud benchmarking capability. At the show, HR Executive Magazine named this one of its Top Products for 2016 and recognized it as one of the year\'s Awesome New Technologies for HR. I should note, this is the second year in a row that we\'ve received these distinguished awards. We received them both last year for the ADP Marketplace, the first and largest HCM app ecosystem in the market. I\'ve said before that innovation is a job that\'s never done, but we are proud of the progress to-date and the external recognition we are receiving. We believe that innovations like these and the investments we are making to simplify our portfolio are essential to our long-term success. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our first quarter results. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we recorded a restructuring charge of about $40 million related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of this charge as well as certain other one-time items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning\'s press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. Before I begin reviewing this quarter\'s results, I wanted to highlight some additional detail regarding the disposition of our COBRA and CHSA businesses. We currently expect the sale to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a pre-tax gain of approximately $200 million, subject to normal and customary closing conditions. The results of operations of these two businesses are currently included in the Employer Services segment and will not be reflected as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we have factored the operational impacts from these dispositions into our updated fiscal year 2017 outlook. As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $2.9 billion, or 8% on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, net earnings grew 10% or 9% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes, or adjusted EBIT, grew 21% or 20% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 230 basis points compared to the 17.6% in the last year\'s first quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 26% to $0.86 and 26% on a constant dollar basis, and benefited from a lower effective tax rate and fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our adjusted effective tax rate was positively impacted following the adoption of a new stock compensation related accounting pronouncement in our first quarter, which helped drive a decrease of our adjusted effective tax rate of approximately 290 basis points to 30.8% or $0.03 on an EPS basis for the quarter. As you read this morning\'s press release, new business bookings growth was flat for the quarter, but in line with our own expectations following two years of successive double-digit growth with meaningful contributions from Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. Overall, our results in the quarter were very good, yielding solid revenue growth with a better-than-expected margin growth. Although we still have a lot of work ahead of us, I\'m also pleased with the progress to-date on our Service Alignment Initiative. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 6% for the quarter and 6% on a constant dollar basis. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.7% in the first quarter. Average client fund balances grew 4% compared to a year ago and 4% on a constant dollar basis. This growth was driven by additions of net new business and increased wage levels compared to the prior year\'s first quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, driven largely by the success of our multi-national solutions, which continue to perform well. Employer Services margin increased about 230 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and a slower growth in our selling expenses following on from the difficult selling compare in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The PEO continues to perform well, growing revenues by 13% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 13% to 439,000 employees. A portion of the 13% revenue growth was impacted by slower growth in our benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower healthcare renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. Along with this revenue growth, the PEO delivered approximately 90 basis points of margin expansion this quarter through increased operating efficiencies. Both of our segments performed well in the quarter and, as Carlos mentioned, we are off to a good start, but we also see a mix of factors that impact our fiscal year 2017 outlook. And I will now take a moment to walk you through our revised outlook with you. First, as I mentioned, our new business bookings growth in the quarter was in line with our plans coming off a difficult compare in the prior-year first quarter. Accordingly, we are reaffirming our full year guidance of 4% to 6% growth on the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We are reaffirming our ES revenue guidance of 4% to 5% and maintaining our PEO revenue guidance at 14% to 16%. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which were included for the full fiscal year 2016 but expected to be only in our results for about the first half of fiscal year 2017, we have reduced our revenue expectations for the year by almost 1 percentage point. As a result, we are now forecasting revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 9%, which is not expected to be significantly impacted by foreign currency translation based on our current rates. As a reminder, during the first half of fiscal 2016, we made certain investments to support our business through the ACA onboarding process, while also continuing to invest in our sales force to leverage the strong tailwinds from the sales of Human Capital Management modules that assist clients in complying with the ACA. And we are seeing the benefits of these investments help drive our margin expansion this quarter. I want to caution you, though, against assuming that this momentum will carry through the remainder of our fiscal year, as we begin to lap these easier compares while continuing to execute on various strategic initiatives, including our client upgrade efforts, investing in innovation and making selected additional service investments. On a segment level, we, therefore, continue to anticipate margin expansion in ES of about 50 basis points. And we are now forecasting about 75 basis points of margin expansion in the PEO. On a consolidated basis, we have revised our adjusted EBIT margin expansion to about 50 basis points from our previous guidance of 25 to 50 basis points. Please also note that this margin expansion continues to include about 20 basis points of pressure from a dual operation pertaining to our Service Alignment Initiative. We are also now expecting growth in our client fund interest revenue to increase $5 million to $10 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of up to $5 million. The total impact from the client fund extended investment strategy is now expected to be up $5 million compared to the prior forecast of flat growth. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. With the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, we now expect growth in our adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about 1% from the first quarter tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about 1 percentage points of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. On a constant dollar basis, our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth is expected to be 11% to 13%. Our forecast continues to contemplate the return of excess cash to shareholders, with share repurchases of $1 billion to $1.4 billion during fiscal year 2017. And this includes any repurchases required to offset any dilution related to employee benefit plans. We believe the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investment, particular through the year-end process as we work to grow our strong fiscal year 2016 sales performance and execute against our strategic initiatives. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We will take our first question from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. You line is open. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just the first one just to confirm the guidance impact on the top-line, confirming that the divestitures of the CHSA and the COBRA businesses is responsible for the change in the revenue outlook, and then also confirming that I heard it was a 1% or so earnings impact from that divestiture as well. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. You\'re correct. That is the case. If you take it digitally, there\'s actually a good uptake (19:58) on both ends, the full percentage off (20:01) our guidance clearly just on the top end. So we clearly had a good revenue performance in the first quarter already. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC And that\'s the only change to the revenue outlook is from that divestiture correct? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yes, that is true. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then, just following up on the service delivery changes, I\'m just wondering, maybe philosophically or as you guys have evolved your business and added a lot more of your technology in the strategic platforms, how has the value of service changed to you or to your clients? And sort of philosophically, how do you approach service now? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as you heard in my comments about the investments we\'ve made in DataCloud and benchmarking, I think there is an evolution of the definition of service to really providing more expertise and more help in terms of analytics and how to run their businesses better. So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance, should they get notices from either Federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments. And so those are the types of services I think we remain committed to continuing to provide, but also to make better and enhance, but, obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the Service Alignment Initiative, I think is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is, given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products particularly in the mid-market or in the up-market, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important then. So you\'re heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach and new service model. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Sure. Within the 20 basis points, the full-year margin headwind related to the dual running cost, as you move to your new integrated service delivery centers, how much was in the first quarter and when do you expect the crossover between increased productivity from the new centers to overcome those frictional costs? Is that a second half event or more likely in fiscal year 2018? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah, I would say that, given that we\'re in the process of ramping up, it\'s safe to say that there was some dual operations cost in the first quarter, but it\'s likely to be more concentrated later in the year in the second half. So I think you have that right. Probably 40%, I would allocate it just for sake of modeling, to 40%-60%, so 40% maybe first half, 60% second half, but overall, 20 basis points for the year. And again, as Jan pointed out, just because of the way the accounting rules work, that is built into our operating expense versus the restructuring costs that were really more intended for things like severance and facilities closure that were directly related to the restructuring and that are non-GAAP. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. And then, are you seeing any additional interest in time and attendance offerings, given the Department of Labor\'s changes to the overtime regulations, which go into place this December? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We are. As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our Time and Attendance products. I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year. We\'re expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year. It just doesn\'t have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really to achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales excluding ACA and excluding our Time and Attendance products. So I guess the long and short of it is yes, it helped, but it wasn\'t material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching so it\'s likely that we will continue. Like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA, we expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products, even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn\'t feel like it\'s having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline-driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules. And so, it\'s a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around – in some cases, if they go six months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there\'s really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk, but it\'s just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Understood. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Thank you. Carlos, can ask you just a quick question on mechanics? The bookings comparisons last year are pretty difficult until the fourth quarter. So given that, how should we think of that 4% to 6% bookings target building as this year progresses, given those comparison? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I appreciate that question. And I think you may have answered the question yourself. So we expect the comparisons to get easier in the second half and hence, mathematically, the growth rates should be easier to achieve in getting to our overall 4% to 6% for the year. And I think just by way of comparison, we went back and looked historically, outside, of course, times where we had recessions and other economic challenges, but in Q1 of 2014, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of 2013 15% growth. And so the scenario this quarter was we had flat growth over last year\'s first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half, we expect, mathematically, to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. I also just want to hasten to add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter, where we had sequential increase last year\'s second quarter, the 15%. So we had, I think it was 13% to 14% growth in the first quarter, and then we had 15% in the second quarter. So we will have another difficult compare, and I think it would be in line with our expectations to have similar sales results from a growth standpoint for the second quarter. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Okay. And it looks like you were at 13% in the third quarter. So it sounds like it\'s pretty back-end loaded to the fourth quarter then? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. That would be right, but, again, we have more information internally around what portion of each of those three quarters was ACA-related versus other. And I would say that you\'re generally correct, but that we would expect the third quarter to have slightly better. Again, we try to stay away from – I don\'t want to fall into the trap of giving quarterly guidance. You\'re generally right. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Right. And then, maybe I could just ask you a little bit more about you made some brief comments about the migrations in the mid-markets and how that\'s going in retentions. So given that retention was declining all of last year and you said it was flat when you back out the CVB (28:42) loss of the customer in the quarter, so does that really imply, given that you were losing throughout the year last year that, in fact, that business started stabilizing even before this quarter? And how, just in general, are you thinking about retention in the kind of residual base who still has not converted thus far? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Sure. I appreciate the question. So the businesses that we\'ve had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But, as you know, like, we have a number of different businesses. We\'re a global company. We have down-market, mid-market, up-market, multi-nationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our up-market businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we\'ve made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we\'re making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations, but that\'s a longer term. We did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve and we\'ve seen results from that. But, again, sometimes, retention can be uneven, just because of the lumpiness and just the way the math works, but we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. This is now probably the second quarter where we\'ve gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we\'ve been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rate. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves, but it was also related to just service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. So we believe we\'ve done the right things. And we feel like we\'re on the right track and we\'re also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients. So I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long-term. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Great. Thanks very much for that color. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on the comments on margins you made earlier, I noted the discussion about lower benefit pass-through costs in the current quarter, but the PEO margins were, I think, a record at 13.5%. Could you maybe talk about whether margins in that segment specifically are sustainable and how much that one-time benefit from the lower pass-through cost had a benefit to optical margin improvement in the quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Jim, thank you for your question, and I will answer it directly to your PEO question, but also put the margin question in a little bit bigger picture because there\'s a lot going on on margin and really we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that that might not be continuing throughout the year. And the pass-through, actually, played a big role in it. So to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid. And with 90 basis points, clearly, that\'s ahead of our long-term kind of expectation, so we do see and want to make progress in the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them and I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvements in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale when we\'re sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 basis points to 75 basis points. Now, relative to the performance in this quarter, and you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail, but the pass-through pressure that we had this year because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP\'s margin by about 85 basis points. Now, the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate it, it\'s between 150 basis points and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, a lower margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical, that higher-margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us, abated due to that good renewal. That renewal, we\'re expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that, and we mentioned it on our call, that we had a flat sales growth and it\'s longstanding tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower, so that contributed a chunk of scale that we anticipate clearly, per Carlos\' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then, the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you are all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year 2016, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in and the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year has abated. We are reaping the revenue and the business is profitable. And so, the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And I think just one other comment on the PEO, I don\'t remember the last time that our PEO worksite employee growth was the same as our revenue growth. And so that obviously, the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps. Obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. Having been in that business for many years, that slower pass-through growth is related to lower healthcare benefit renewals, which should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you\'re hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients, I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it\'s a very, very big positive for that business. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs That\'s helpful color. Thank you. And then, maybe just a quick clarification, the client loss in the CHSA business that drove the 100 basis point decline in retention was fairly substantial in terms of overall scale. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color of whether that\'s a competitive takeaway and then specifically is that client a customer of ADP in terms of other service offerings? And what\'s the disposition on those other offerings, if any? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So fortunately, it\'s easy to talk about it because WageWorks, I think, is the company who won that account. And they won it – it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business to them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which was a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don\'t have a lot of public-sector government business. We have some. And we like that business, but we just don\'t have a lot of it. And we certainly don\'t have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale, with or without the government. And so the original genesis of that account was, it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it, came the risk of, when these contracts get put out to bid, you don\'t always win. And so, we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account, but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. I can\'t remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account. And I think some people speculated that it had come from us. And we can now confirm that it did come from us. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hi, guys. Good morning. Carlos, you\'ve been talking about the data analytics opportunity and the value in that data you have, I guess really since the Investor Day at the beginning of last year. Can you give us a sense how you\'ve, since then, progressed in terms of figuring out exactly how you will monetize the asset? Are you charging for this separately at the moment? Are you actively trying to sell that as a standalone offering? Or is it really more focused on an add into existing customers to help them see more value in ADP and hopefully improve retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. For now, we are selling it as an add-in. I think as I mentioned in my comments, we have 3,200 clients right now. That\'s obviously a very small number in comparison to the total client base that we have. So we think there\'s still a lot of opportunity. But we do like to leave our options open in terms of the "monetization", because the one thing it clearly does is it\'s a big differentiator for us. It\'s a huge way of creating thought leadership for ADP and, most importantly, it\'s an incredibly important way of driving value for our clients by helping them run their businesses better. So we think there\'s a number of ways that we could benefit from this in terms of stronger sales, additional revenues as an add-on module, halo effect in terms of marketing and thought leadership. So I think it\'s a big winner on a number of fronts, as other analytics and data businesses are for other companies. We\'re not the only company taking advantage of when you have the scale and you have the data, being able to marshal that to create differentiation and value for clients, I think is a pretty common theme out in the marketplace right now. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay, and is there sort of a product roadmap as to other analytics and ways to expand the usefulness of this? And I guess one things that jumps to mind as a potential risk, are there regulatory issues or concerns or hurdles you have to get over in terms of using data about consumers, as either part of the benchmarking or however else it\'s used in this? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a very good question. The answer to the first part of the question is, yes, we do have a roadmap and we have lots of plans and things that we can do to create more benchmarking solutions and more analytics for our clients. And obviously, we\'re not going to talk about those right now. In terms of the second part, so we do have permission, if you will, to use the data from our clients. And, most importantly, the data is anonymized. And so this data, there is no personally identifiable information, and it\'s not necessary in order to create the benchmarkings and the analytics and the information that we deliver back to our clients. And so I think we\'re very sensitive, obviously. If there\'s any company in the world that understands the value of privacy and sensitivity to security, I think it\'s ADP. And we\'ve been very careful over the last several years to make sure that we have the right kinds of approvals and permissions from our clients, and also that we are anonymizing the information so that none of the information has things like Social Security Numbers or addresses or anything like that. And that\'s generally not necessary to perform some of the analytics that need to be performed. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on the accounting adoption of the new accounting for stock-comp taxes, did you expect in the guidance any impact on the rest of the year? And given the variability of that, do you have confidence in that outlook? Or is this something that could be a positive later in the year, but it\'s just hard for you to predict at this point? Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you for the question, because it is quite a big impact that we experienced as a tax benefit for this year. And we have taken the stand not to forecast the impact of the tax impact of our equity compensation cost for the future quarters, because it is dependent on our share price development, and it is also dependent on the employee behavior and executing mostly stock options. So our plan is every quarter, to let basically that tax benefit fall through to the bottom line, and we would update our guidance for the total EPS growth one-on-one as the tax benefit or the tax hurt is incurred. We have done a historic analysis of our performance under these, so to speak, a pro forma backwards. And historically, we have experienced benefit out of those accounting rules, but there\'s no guarantee that that would continue in the future. And we found it too difficult to forecast. So we take it as falling through and you would get benefit one-on-one in each quarter. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. On the Service Alignment Initiative, can you guys just talk a little bit about how you see the impact of that, both on driving ancillary revenue streams as you I guess move to a teamed selling model, or a teamed service model, long-term margin improvement and then also any potential disruption in the client relationships as you consolidate people back? Just what are the kind of the puts and takes and how do you see those playing out as you implement the new service alignment model? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you did a very good job of describing some of the puts and takes in terms of some of the potential upsides and some of the risks. As you heard from our comments, we did build in what we\'re calling dual operations costs to avoid the last part that you mentioned, which is transition challenges, if you will. So we want to make sure that we have people trained and ready before we move work. But there\'s obviously always, you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, we\'re not moving 90% of our associates. We\'re moving anywhere between 5% and 10% of our associates. So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we\'re talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera, but this is not a one-time overnight, dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates, because we have a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates that have been very loyal to the company. And so we\'re being very, very careful and methodical on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates, so that we can move on with our business plans, but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we\'ve said, I think, previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention. We don\'t have a scientific way of forecasting that or telling you when that will happen. And it certainly is not expected to happen this year, because we\'re just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross-sell more easily, should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But, again, those are hypotheticals that are very hard to forecast and we\'re certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we\'re not doing it just to take risk. We\'re doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I might add for our associates, also it offers, of course, a better ability to work in centers that have defined career pathing. They are located in areas of the U.S. that we believe give us great access to all associates. And so, it will create really also for us as an employer of choice, a great opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah, as Jan was saying, associate engagement is an incredibly important part of our success and of any service business\' success. And I think having large centers with anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 associates that are able to progress in terms of their careers, move across business units, across different parts of HCM, I think should be a very big positive for us. But, again, that\'s a longer-term benefit for the company. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. And then, just as a quick follow up, can you give us an idea of – one thing you don\'t comment on very frequently is what the retention dynamics are within the PEO. On one hand, I know that the average client size there is smaller, so you\'re more likely to lose, just from companies going out of business. But on the other hand, I don\'t know why, once you join the PEO, why you ever leave. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The PEO average client size is now slightly below 50, actually, so around 40, I believe. I\'m looking at Christian, so about 40 employees, so it has ticked up a little bit. And I think this has been partially driven, of course, by the dynamic of the last few years where we added slightly larger clients to the PEO because it offers a great answer on compliance and probably partially a little bit aided by the dynamics of the Affordable Care Act. And I\'m happy to report that the PEO exhibits great retention rates. And they have been actually improving over time. I\'m looking at Christian. If (48:42) I say they did have record retention this quarter, so they\'re doing well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah, hi, guys. Just noticed, Carlos, in your comments, you were talking about the strategic cloud platforms having a positive impact on your business. So I guess I was just curious of what percent you are complete migrating clients to these cloud platforms now? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, we do look at it by segment because you do have to be careful about units versus revenue, right, and two things are important. So if you at it based on units, we\'re almost 90% migrated, but that\'s mainly because we\'ve moved all of our clients onto our RUN platform in the down markets. So from a revenue standpoint, we\'re a little bit less than half, I think, of the revenues for the company. So if you look at it by segment, we\'re done in the down market. I think we should be done by the end of this fiscal year. I think that\'s consistent with what we said in the past, that we\'re on track. And we\'re saying it now, that we\'re on track to have our mid-market clients on our WFN current version platform by the end of this fiscal year or within a month or two after that. And then, when you move up into the up-market, we have migrated some clients over to Vantage. And we have plans underway to continue those migrations, but those are literally one at a time. Whereas, in the down-market and in RUN, there were just large groups of clients that we would migrate every week. In the up-market it\'s one at a time, talking to each client individually, creating a schedule and creating a path, but we have done migrations. And we will continue to do migrations in the up-market, but that will take considerably longer than what we did in our down-market business, which took us probably over the course of two years to three years to migrate all of those clients. So we\'re very happy with the progress. We believe that when we migrate our clients, we create a more defensible, bigger moat against competition. We believe that it creates an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services. And we believe it strengthens our relationships with our clients. And most importantly, we think it\'s the right thing for our clients. So we\'re still on track and we\'re continuing to move ahead. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. No, I appreciate the update. And then, just as a follow-up, retention was down, I think, 1 point last year, in fiscal year 2016. If you ex out the divested acquisitions, does it make any difference to that retention number? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Too small to have an impact. The divestiture really has no impact one way or the other. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. So it was kind of an unusual one-time client loss that caused this? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. This is a one large client loss. We typically don\'t have clients of this size. And we point it out because it is a non-strategic asset in the public space, so this is a very unique situation for us. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, this is disclosed in our 10-K and in our once-a-year. I don\'t believe we have another client that represents that size revenue for us. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, helpful. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick questions, I noticed your cash flow from operations was fairly sizable, a nice increase on a year-over-year basis. Were there some timing issues going on either this year or last year? And how should we expect the quarters to kind of play out for the rest of the year? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I am excited that we get a cash flow question. We rarely do get one. So your hint, you\'re already also giving the right answer. If you dig a little deeper into our operational cash flows, you\'ll see a cautious (52:32) swing in our accounts receivables on our balance sheet. And this is driven mostly due to accounts receivable change in the PEO business and that has rectified itself already. If you adjust for a number of one-time items in this, cash flows are expected to really grow in line with our operating results, so it could be these timing issues on accounts receivable here and there, but, in the long run, cash flows develop really very nicely in line with our operating performance. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay, great. That\'s helpful. And I know some of the other business services and staffing-related companies have been talking about some client uncertainty in terms of making decisions. And I\'m just curious if you\'ve been seeing any of that. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I\'m not sure how you measure that, so I think we know that, for example, in fiscal year 2011, when we had government shutdowns and so forth, like because this is – we hesitate to answer the question because we don\'t have any way of really measuring that. But intuitively, we know that large events do sometimes impact, particularly up-market decision-making. And so, is the election having some kind of impact? You\'ll have to stay tuned for our next quarter call, that we will be able to tell you, with the benefit of hindsight, whether or not we experienced some of that. So very hard to measure, but we have to acknowledge that large events and large uncertainties do sometimes create uncertainties in the market. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Yeah, I guess what they have been saying is that they\'ve been seeing some delays in terms of new business sign-up and I thought maybe you\'d seen some of that impact on your bookings, not necessarily just the tough comparisons versus last year. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Through the first quarter, the answer would be if you exclude – and again, this is also not scientifically easy to do, because we sold so much additional modules, not just ACA, but related to ACA, so Benefits Administration, et cetera. But if you look at our sales results and take a general swag, if you could somehow back out the ACA sales from last year, we had, I would say, good sales results for the quarter. So I would say that through the first quarter, the answer would be we didn\'t see a lot of that, but I think you should not under-hear in my comments any level of confidence that there isn\'t that happening because large events like we saw with the 2011 and 2013, (55:10) there were couple of budget battles and a couple of issues around government shutdown and so forth, that it did seem that there were some kind of delays in terms of decision-making in the marketplace. But back then and today, we have no way of measuring that, other than anecdotal stories. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I know it\'s a tough question to ask. So I appreciate you taking a stab at it. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator And we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to majors, how many more clients do you still have to transition and how would you characterize those clients as they\'re coming up along the tail-end? Are they more likely to go through a smooth transition or are they more inclined to be kind of the types that would take a look at other alternatives? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a great question. And I think, as usual, the answer is I think it\'s mixed, in terms of we have a lot more experience, obviously, now in migrating clients and, particularly, the experience we developed last year when our volumes of upgrades almost doubled as we were trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades, because they\'re intended to be a positive and to create a better experience and deliver a better product to the client. And so, I think on one side of the scale, you would say we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now on how to do this better. On the other side of the scale, human nature is such that – and no one consciously does this but – then when you go through these types of events, you realize, oh, it looks like we have some of the toughest ones waiting towards the end, because there may be clients, for example, that we approach and ask them to upgrade and they say, well, I don\'t want to do it now, call me in a quarter. And then, we are getting to the point now where we\'re going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don\'t think there\'s an enormous amount of that. It\'s not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn\'t want to go, but just being realistic in the sense that – and also deferent to our associates who have still a lot of hard work ahead of them over the next three quarters or so, because it\'s not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now are at a more manageable level, where I think we\'re doing a much higher quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it, but your questions are, I think, fair. And I think the answer is the scales are balanced. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Great. I appreciate the answer. And then, with regards to Vantage, how well positioned is that now for like once you get through this and you\'re going through the next stage of transitions, do you feel good about that solution as it currently stands? I know you\'re always innovating, always optimizing. Is it matters of degree in terms of getting it to exactly where you want? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I mean, to put it in perspective, we have about double the number of clients. I think it\'s up to 270 or 280, somewhere in the range, at the end of this quarter versus the same period last year. So I think that tells you something. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah, that\'s great. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We would like it to be higher. And we would have liked it to have been higher by now, but I think we\'re still growing well. We had good growth in the quarter in terms of Vantage. So I mean, I think that in terms of the product itself, we\'re pretty happy with the progress we\'ve made, particularly over the last two or three releases. Again, we get a lot of metrics and a lot of data around stability and other factors, defects, et cetera, and we\'ve made a lot of progress. So it feels like the trajectory is in a positive direction for Vantage, not just growth-wise, but I think in terms of the underlying metrics that we measure around quality and stability. Operator Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We thank you all for joining our call today. As you can tell, we got off to a really good start, on top of the great results. We\'re incredibly happy about the positive recognition we\'re getting in the marketplace, as you heard from some of my comments. It really helps us in terms of our thought leadership in the market. I think the investments we\'re making in our innovation efforts and also our simplification of our portfolio and aligning them to our service model, I think are going to yield great results for us. And I think we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute against those plans. The last thing I want to do is just acknowledge associates. We had a very tough year last year. I know I said it last quarter, but we had a challenging year. And we really appreciate all the efforts to continue to deliver great service to our clients. The commitment that our service associates have to our clients is unmatched, and it\'s one of the great strengths of ADP. So I just want to acknowledge them and give them my appreciation. And also, I want to thank all of you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\'s conference.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator We will take our first question from the line of Rick Eskelsen with Wells Fargo. You line is open. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just the first one just to confirm the guidance impact on the top-line, confirming that the divestitures of the CHSA and the COBRA businesses is responsible for the change in the revenue outlook, and then also confirming that I heard it was a 1% or so earnings impact from that divestiture as well. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. You\'re correct. That is the case. If you take it digitally, there\'s actually a good uptake (19:58) on both ends, the full percentage off (20:01) our guidance clearly just on the top end. So we clearly had a good revenue performance in the first quarter already. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC And that\'s the only change to the revenue outlook is from that divestiture correct? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yes, that is true. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then, just following up on the service delivery changes, I\'m just wondering, maybe philosophically or as you guys have evolved your business and added a lot more of your technology in the strategic platforms, how has the value of service changed to you or to your clients? And sort of philosophically, how do you approach service now? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as you heard in my comments about the investments we\'ve made in DataCloud and benchmarking, I think there is an evolution of the definition of service to really providing more expertise and more help in terms of analytics and how to run their businesses better. So some of the things that we traditionally have been strong on in service, I think still are a key part of our value proposition. So as an example, we have a very effective, very value-added tax business that helps clients with compliance, should they get notices from either Federal, state or local agencies regarding tax payments. And so those are the types of services I think we remain committed to continuing to provide, but also to make better and enhance, but, obviously, with the evolution of technology and the evolution of the markets, I think there are opportunities for us to redefine service. And I think some of the Service Alignment Initiative, I think is intended to go exactly in that direction. So another example I would give is, given the increased penetration of multiple HCM modules when clients purchase our products particularly in the mid-market or in the up-market, I think the integration of not only our products but of our service experience becomes very important then. So you\'re heard us talk about creating intact teams in some of these new strategic locations that I think is intended to support this evolution of this new service approach and new service model. Richard M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Sure. Within the 20 basis points, the full-year margin headwind related to the dual running cost, as you move to your new integrated service delivery centers, how much was in the first quarter and when do you expect the crossover between increased productivity from the new centers to overcome those frictional costs? Is that a second half event or more likely in fiscal year 2018? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah, I would say that, given that we\'re in the process of ramping up, it\'s safe to say that there was some dual operations cost in the first quarter, but it\'s likely to be more concentrated later in the year in the second half. So I think you have that right. Probably 40%, I would allocate it just for sake of modeling, to 40%-60%, so 40% maybe first half, 60% second half, but overall, 20 basis points for the year. And again, as Jan pointed out, just because of the way the accounting rules work, that is built into our operating expense versus the restructuring costs that were really more intended for things like severance and facilities closure that were directly related to the restructuring and that are non-GAAP. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. And then, are you seeing any additional interest in time and attendance offerings, given the Department of Labor\'s changes to the overtime regulations, which go into place this December? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We are. As we were going through the materials for the earnings call, we get a lot of detail by market segment and also by product. And we have seen better sales and more interest in our Time and Attendance products. I think that the challenge for us is scale. Given the size of our sales number, we sold $1.75 billion last year. We\'re expecting to grow 4% to 6% this year. It just doesn\'t have the same scale and magnitude of, as an example, ACA. So for us to really to achieve our sales results, we have to have across-the-board strength in our sales excluding ACA and excluding our Time and Attendance products. So I guess the long and short of it is yes, it helped, but it wasn\'t material in the grand scheme of things. And the deadline is approaching so it\'s likely that we will continue. Like a lot of these changes in regulations and complexity, no different than ACA, we expect it to continue to help with sales and help drive demand for our products, even after the deadline, which I believe is in December of this year. But it just doesn\'t feel like it\'s having the same magnitude and same kind of scale impact that we had with ACA. And part that might be that the ACA rules were really deadline-driven, and there was a form that needed to be filled out and filed. In this case, these are just changes in rules. And so, it\'s a slightly different decision for clients and prospects around – in some cases, if they go six months without the right tools to be able to manage the new environment, there\'s really no consequences other than the risk of a potential investigation or fine or whatnot, which is obviously a real risk, but it\'s just different from a deadline-driven event like ACA. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Understood. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel Financial. Please go ahead. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Thank you. Carlos, can ask you just a quick question on mechanics? The bookings comparisons last year are pretty difficult until the fourth quarter. So given that, how should we think of that 4% to 6% bookings target building as this year progresses, given those comparison? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I appreciate that question. And I think you may have answered the question yourself. So we expect the comparisons to get easier in the second half and hence, mathematically, the growth rates should be easier to achieve in getting to our overall 4% to 6% for the year. And I think just by way of comparison, we went back and looked historically, outside, of course, times where we had recessions and other economic challenges, but in Q1 of 2014, we had 1% sales growth, and that was following on Q1 of 2013 15% growth. And so the scenario this quarter was we had flat growth over last year\'s first quarter of around 14% sales growth. And so I think that when you look at kind of just the size and the scale of these numbers and you look at the way we laid out our forecast for the year, then I think that you can probably deduce that the second half, we expect, mathematically, to be stronger from a growth rate standpoint than the first half. I also just want to hasten to add that we have the same kind of issue in the second quarter, where we had sequential increase last year\'s second quarter, the 15%. So we had, I think it was 13% to 14% growth in the first quarter, and then we had 15% in the second quarter. So we will have another difficult compare, and I think it would be in line with our expectations to have similar sales results from a growth standpoint for the second quarter. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Okay. And it looks like you were at 13% in the third quarter. So it sounds like it\'s pretty back-end loaded to the fourth quarter then? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. That would be right, but, again, we have more information internally around what portion of each of those three quarters was ACA-related versus other. And I would say that you\'re generally correct, but that we would expect the third quarter to have slightly better. Again, we try to stay away from – I don\'t want to fall into the trap of giving quarterly guidance. You\'re generally right. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Right. And then, maybe I could just ask you a little bit more about you made some brief comments about the migrations in the mid-markets and how that\'s going in retentions. So given that retention was declining all of last year and you said it was flat when you back out the CVB (28:42) loss of the customer in the quarter, so does that really imply, given that you were losing throughout the year last year that, in fact, that business started stabilizing even before this quarter? And how, just in general, are you thinking about retention in the kind of residual base who still has not converted thus far? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Sure. I appreciate the question. So the businesses that we\'ve had some challenges with last year, which I think we were clear that was concentrated in the mid-market, have shown, I think, improvement for several quarters, including this quarter. But, as you know, like, we have a number of different businesses. We\'re a global company. We have down-market, mid-market, up-market, multi-nationals. Some of our businesses are also lumpy, particularly our up-market businesses and our BPO businesses. And so we feel good about the progress we\'ve made where we made the investments to stabilize and the investments we made in service. As you know, we\'re making some longer-term investments in terms of some of these new locations, but that\'s a longer term. We did a lot of short-term things to stabilize and improve and we\'ve seen results from that. But, again, sometimes, retention can be uneven, just because of the lumpiness and just the way the math works, but we feel pretty good about where we are. We believe that we are on a good trajectory here in terms of continuing to do migrations and upgrades, which allows us to stay on track for what our objectives are without putting additional incremental pressure on retention. This is now probably the second quarter where we\'ve gone back and started our upgrades at a, I would call, normal reasonable pace, and we\'ve been able to continue to make improvements in our mid-market retention rate. So that tells me that part of the issue was related to the upgrades themselves, but it was also related to just service challenges, pressure from ACA just because of volumes of work and a couple of other factors. So we believe we\'ve done the right things. And we feel like we\'re on the right track and we\'re also sticking to our plans around our migrations and our upgrades of our clients. So I think it just strengthens us competitively over the long-term. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Great. Thanks very much for that color. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Following up on the comments on margins you made earlier, I noted the discussion about lower benefit pass-through costs in the current quarter, but the PEO margins were, I think, a record at 13.5%. Could you maybe talk about whether margins in that segment specifically are sustainable and how much that one-time benefit from the lower pass-through cost had a benefit to optical margin improvement in the quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Jim, thank you for your question, and I will answer it directly to your PEO question, but also put the margin question in a little bit bigger picture because there\'s a lot going on on margin and really we had great margin expansion this first quarter, but we are trying to send a signal that that might not be continuing throughout the year. And the pass-through, actually, played a big role in it. So to answer your first question directly, the operational scale that we saw in the PEO was solid. And with 90 basis points, clearly, that\'s ahead of our long-term kind of expectation, so we do see and want to make progress in the efficiencies, but it was probably a very good quarter for them and I would caution you to anticipate that type of level of productivity improvements in the long run. But clearly, all our businesses need to deliver scale when we\'re sticking with our own long-term expectations of driving the margin in the company of 50 basis points to 75 basis points. Now, relative to the performance in this quarter, and you will be able to dissect this once you go through the Q a little bit more detail, but the pass-through pressure that we had this year because the PEO was growing actually faster than the overall company, was actually depressing ADP\'s margin by about 85 basis points. Now, the pass-through pressure is typically actually higher. And if you calculate it, it\'s between 150 basis points and 200 basis points of pressure, we call this a portfolio effect, a lower margin business of PEO is growing faster than ES. And this quarter, we were helped because that typical, that higher-margin pressure that the pass-throughs give us, abated due to that good renewal. That renewal, we\'re expecting to grow out of it by the second half of the year. So that is going to be a big contributor to slower margin expansion for the second half of the year. You will also see that, and we mentioned it on our call, that we had a flat sales growth and it\'s longstanding tradition that if sales are growing slower, our marketing and sales expense is growing slower, so that contributed a chunk of scale that we anticipate clearly, per Carlos\' discussion, just the prior question, to abate as we accelerate our sales in the second half of the year. And then, the scaling of our ACA business plays an important role. Clearly, you are all aware that the revenue stream started really in the second half of the ACA business, while in the first half of last fiscal year 2016, we made implementation and operational investments to build the business. So we started to see the revenue contribution kick in and the pressure that the building of the ACA business exuded on the business in the first half of last fiscal year has abated. We are reaping the revenue and the business is profitable. And so, the scaling of the ACA business also had a meaningful impact on the margin expansion this quarter. And clearly, we expect that actually to abate also in the second half of the year because the business started to generate revenue in the second half of last fiscal year. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And I think just one other comment on the PEO, I don\'t remember the last time that our PEO worksite employee growth was the same as our revenue growth. And so that obviously, the very first point that Jan made, I think that helps. Obviously, mathematically, it makes it easier for the PEO to achieve greater margin improvement when they have slower pass-through cost growth. Having been in that business for many years, that slower pass-through growth is related to lower healthcare benefit renewals, which should be a very big positive from a competitive standpoint. So as you\'re hearing, seeing a lot of headlines about increasing health inflation and the discipline that our business has around selling and renewing clients, I think has, as of this last open enrollment for the PEO, led to very, very competitive renewal rates that are having this impact on the revenue growth, but it\'s a very, very big positive for that business. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs That\'s helpful color. Thank you. And then, maybe just a quick clarification, the client loss in the CHSA business that drove the 100 basis point decline in retention was fairly substantial in terms of overall scale. Can you maybe just give us a little bit of color of whether that\'s a competitive takeaway and then specifically is that client a customer of ADP in terms of other service offerings? And what\'s the disposition on those other offerings, if any? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So fortunately, it\'s easy to talk about it because WageWorks, I think, is the company who won that account. And they won it – it was one of the factors in our decision to sell the business to them because we got to know each other as a result of them winning that contract, which was a government contract from the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, which is a government entity. As you know, we don\'t have a lot of public-sector government business. We have some. And we like that business, but we just don\'t have a lot of it. And we certainly don\'t have a lot of contracts of that size and that scale, with or without the government. And so the original genesis of that account was, it came through an acquisition of a company called SHPS that we acquired several years back, where we acquired other benefits administration assets that we were interested in. And this account came with it. And with it, came the risk of, when these contracts get put out to bid, you don\'t always win. And so, we took a calculated risk when we made that acquisition, not just with this account, but like with all acquisitions, and that was one of the items that came along with that acquisition. I can\'t remember how many months ago it was, but I believe there was a public release by WageWorks regarding the winning of that account. And I think some people speculated that it had come from us. And we can now confirm that it did come from us. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hi, guys. Good morning. Carlos, you\'ve been talking about the data analytics opportunity and the value in that data you have, I guess really since the Investor Day at the beginning of last year. Can you give us a sense how you\'ve, since then, progressed in terms of figuring out exactly how you will monetize the asset? Are you charging for this separately at the moment? Are you actively trying to sell that as a standalone offering? Or is it really more focused on an add into existing customers to help them see more value in ADP and hopefully improve retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. For now, we are selling it as an add-in. I think as I mentioned in my comments, we have 3,200 clients right now. That\'s obviously a very small number in comparison to the total client base that we have. So we think there\'s still a lot of opportunity. But we do like to leave our options open in terms of the "monetization", because the one thing it clearly does is it\'s a big differentiator for us. It\'s a huge way of creating thought leadership for ADP and, most importantly, it\'s an incredibly important way of driving value for our clients by helping them run their businesses better. So we think there\'s a number of ways that we could benefit from this in terms of stronger sales, additional revenues as an add-on module, halo effect in terms of marketing and thought leadership. So I think it\'s a big winner on a number of fronts, as other analytics and data businesses are for other companies. We\'re not the only company taking advantage of when you have the scale and you have the data, being able to marshal that to create differentiation and value for clients, I think is a pretty common theme out in the marketplace right now. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay, and is there sort of a product roadmap as to other analytics and ways to expand the usefulness of this? And I guess one things that jumps to mind as a potential risk, are there regulatory issues or concerns or hurdles you have to get over in terms of using data about consumers, as either part of the benchmarking or however else it\'s used in this? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a very good question. The answer to the first part of the question is, yes, we do have a roadmap and we have lots of plans and things that we can do to create more benchmarking solutions and more analytics for our clients. And obviously, we\'re not going to talk about those right now. In terms of the second part, so we do have permission, if you will, to use the data from our clients. And, most importantly, the data is anonymized. And so this data, there is no personally identifiable information, and it\'s not necessary in order to create the benchmarkings and the analytics and the information that we deliver back to our clients. And so I think we\'re very sensitive, obviously. If there\'s any company in the world that understands the value of privacy and sensitivity to security, I think it\'s ADP. And we\'ve been very careful over the last several years to make sure that we have the right kinds of approvals and permissions from our clients, and also that we are anonymizing the information so that none of the information has things like Social Security Numbers or addresses or anything like that. And that\'s generally not necessary to perform some of the analytics that need to be performed. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on the accounting adoption of the new accounting for stock-comp taxes, did you expect in the guidance any impact on the rest of the year? And given the variability of that, do you have confidence in that outlook? Or is this something that could be a positive later in the year, but it\'s just hard for you to predict at this point? Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you for the question, because it is quite a big impact that we experienced as a tax benefit for this year. And we have taken the stand not to forecast the impact of the tax impact of our equity compensation cost for the future quarters, because it is dependent on our share price development, and it is also dependent on the employee behavior and executing mostly stock options. So our plan is every quarter, to let basically that tax benefit fall through to the bottom line, and we would update our guidance for the total EPS growth one-on-one as the tax benefit or the tax hurt is incurred. We have done a historic analysis of our performance under these, so to speak, a pro forma backwards. And historically, we have experienced benefit out of those accounting rules, but there\'s no guarantee that that would continue in the future. And we found it too difficult to forecast. So we take it as falling through and you would get benefit one-on-one in each quarter. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. On the Service Alignment Initiative, can you guys just talk a little bit about how you see the impact of that, both on driving ancillary revenue streams as you I guess move to a teamed selling model, or a teamed service model, long-term margin improvement and then also any potential disruption in the client relationships as you consolidate people back? Just what are the kind of the puts and takes and how do you see those playing out as you implement the new service alignment model? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you did a very good job of describing some of the puts and takes in terms of some of the potential upsides and some of the risks. As you heard from our comments, we did build in what we\'re calling dual operations costs to avoid the last part that you mentioned, which is transition challenges, if you will. So we want to make sure that we have people trained and ready before we move work. But there\'s obviously always, you have to manage through that kind of transition risk as well. To be clear, we\'re not moving 90% of our associates. We\'re moving anywhere between 5% and 10% of our associates. So over time, we expect that to have the kind of positive impacts we\'re talking about in terms of incremental revenue growth, improved service, et cetera, but this is not a one-time overnight, dramatic move that is intended to create an enormous amount of risk or, frankly, disruption for our associates, because we have a long history of treating our people right. We have highly tenured associates that have been very loyal to the company. And so we\'re being very, very careful and methodical on how we do this and how we communicate to our associates, so that we can move on with our business plans, but also treat people the right way. But having said all that, the idea, as we\'ve said, I think, previously, is to, most importantly, deliver better integrated service through intact teams of multiple modules of HCM. And so the intention would be that there would be a benefit to retention. We don\'t have a scientific way of forecasting that or telling you when that will happen. And it certainly is not expected to happen this year, because we\'re just in the process of getting these places all ramped up and scaled. And obviously, the effect of having better service, a better reputation and being able to cross-sell more easily, should have some impact on our ability to sell and on our revenue growth as well. But, again, those are hypotheticals that are very hard to forecast and we\'re certainly not building anything into our forecast for this year. But we\'re not doing it just to take risk. We\'re doing it because we see benefits in terms of operational efficiencies, potential retention and potential growth down the line. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I might add for our associates, also it offers, of course, a better ability to work in centers that have defined career pathing. They are located in areas of the U.S. that we believe give us great access to all associates. And so, it will create really also for us as an employer of choice, a great opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah, as Jan was saying, associate engagement is an incredibly important part of our success and of any service business\' success. And I think having large centers with anywhere between 2,000 and 3,000 associates that are able to progress in terms of their careers, move across business units, across different parts of HCM, I think should be a very big positive for us. But, again, that\'s a longer-term benefit for the company. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. And then, just as a quick follow up, can you give us an idea of – one thing you don\'t comment on very frequently is what the retention dynamics are within the PEO. On one hand, I know that the average client size there is smaller, so you\'re more likely to lose, just from companies going out of business. But on the other hand, I don\'t know why, once you join the PEO, why you ever leave. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The PEO average client size is now slightly below 50, actually, so around 40, I believe. I\'m looking at Christian, so about 40 employees, so it has ticked up a little bit. And I think this has been partially driven, of course, by the dynamic of the last few years where we added slightly larger clients to the PEO because it offers a great answer on compliance and probably partially a little bit aided by the dynamics of the Affordable Care Act. And I\'m happy to report that the PEO exhibits great retention rates. And they have been actually improving over time. I\'m looking at Christian. If (48:42) I say they did have record retention this quarter, so they\'re doing well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Yeah, hi, guys. Just noticed, Carlos, in your comments, you were talking about the strategic cloud platforms having a positive impact on your business. So I guess I was just curious of what percent you are complete migrating clients to these cloud platforms now? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, we do look at it by segment because you do have to be careful about units versus revenue, right, and two things are important. So if you at it based on units, we\'re almost 90% migrated, but that\'s mainly because we\'ve moved all of our clients onto our RUN platform in the down markets. So from a revenue standpoint, we\'re a little bit less than half, I think, of the revenues for the company. So if you look at it by segment, we\'re done in the down market. I think we should be done by the end of this fiscal year. I think that\'s consistent with what we said in the past, that we\'re on track. And we\'re saying it now, that we\'re on track to have our mid-market clients on our WFN current version platform by the end of this fiscal year or within a month or two after that. And then, when you move up into the up-market, we have migrated some clients over to Vantage. And we have plans underway to continue those migrations, but those are literally one at a time. Whereas, in the down-market and in RUN, there were just large groups of clients that we would migrate every week. In the up-market it\'s one at a time, talking to each client individually, creating a schedule and creating a path, but we have done migrations. And we will continue to do migrations in the up-market, but that will take considerably longer than what we did in our down-market business, which took us probably over the course of two years to three years to migrate all of those clients. So we\'re very happy with the progress. We believe that when we migrate our clients, we create a more defensible, bigger moat against competition. We believe that it creates an opportunity for us to sell additional products and services. And we believe it strengthens our relationships with our clients. And most importantly, we think it\'s the right thing for our clients. So we\'re still on track and we\'re continuing to move ahead. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. No, I appreciate the update. And then, just as a follow-up, retention was down, I think, 1 point last year, in fiscal year 2016. If you ex out the divested acquisitions, does it make any difference to that retention number? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Too small to have an impact. The divestiture really has no impact one way or the other. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. So it was kind of an unusual one-time client loss that caused this? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. This is a one large client loss. We typically don\'t have clients of this size. And we point it out because it is a non-strategic asset in the public space, so this is a very unique situation for us. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, this is disclosed in our 10-K and in our once-a-year. I don\'t believe we have another client that represents that size revenue for us. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, helpful. Thanks so much. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks so much. Just a couple of quick questions, I noticed your cash flow from operations was fairly sizable, a nice increase on a year-over-year basis. Were there some timing issues going on either this year or last year? And how should we expect the quarters to kind of play out for the rest of the year? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I am excited that we get a cash flow question. We rarely do get one. So your hint, you\'re already also giving the right answer. If you dig a little deeper into our operational cash flows, you\'ll see a cautious (52:32) swing in our accounts receivables on our balance sheet. And this is driven mostly due to accounts receivable change in the PEO business and that has rectified itself already. If you adjust for a number of one-time items in this, cash flows are expected to really grow in line with our operating results, so it could be these timing issues on accounts receivable here and there, but, in the long run, cash flows develop really very nicely in line with our operating performance. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay, great. That\'s helpful. And I know some of the other business services and staffing-related companies have been talking about some client uncertainty in terms of making decisions. And I\'m just curious if you\'ve been seeing any of that. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I\'m not sure how you measure that, so I think we know that, for example, in fiscal year 2011, when we had government shutdowns and so forth, like because this is – we hesitate to answer the question because we don\'t have any way of really measuring that. But intuitively, we know that large events do sometimes impact, particularly up-market decision-making. And so, is the election having some kind of impact? You\'ll have to stay tuned for our next quarter call, that we will be able to tell you, with the benefit of hindsight, whether or not we experienced some of that. So very hard to measure, but we have to acknowledge that large events and large uncertainties do sometimes create uncertainties in the market. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Yeah, I guess what they have been saying is that they\'ve been seeing some delays in terms of new business sign-up and I thought maybe you\'d seen some of that impact on your bookings, not necessarily just the tough comparisons versus last year. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Through the first quarter, the answer would be if you exclude – and again, this is also not scientifically easy to do, because we sold so much additional modules, not just ACA, but related to ACA, so Benefits Administration, et cetera. But if you look at our sales results and take a general swag, if you could somehow back out the ACA sales from last year, we had, I would say, good sales results for the quarter. So I would say that through the first quarter, the answer would be we didn\'t see a lot of that, but I think you should not under-hear in my comments any level of confidence that there isn\'t that happening because large events like we saw with the 2011 and 2013, (55:10) there were couple of budget battles and a couple of issues around government shutdown and so forth, that it did seem that there were some kind of delays in terms of decision-making in the marketplace. But back then and today, we have no way of measuring that, other than anecdotal stories. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I know it\'s a tough question to ask. So I appreciate you taking a stab at it. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator And we have time for one more question. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Please go ahead. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to majors, how many more clients do you still have to transition and how would you characterize those clients as they\'re coming up along the tail-end? Are they more likely to go through a smooth transition or are they more inclined to be kind of the types that would take a look at other alternatives? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a great question. And I think, as usual, the answer is I think it\'s mixed, in terms of we have a lot more experience, obviously, now in migrating clients and, particularly, the experience we developed last year when our volumes of upgrades almost doubled as we were trying to move clients over to the new platform in order to be able to give them the ACA product. That really created an enormous amount of learning opportunity for us in terms of how to do it better and how to do it at scale and what not to do around these upgrades, because they\'re intended to be a positive and to create a better experience and deliver a better product to the client. And so, I think on one side of the scale, you would say we have an enormous amount of body of knowledge now on how to do this better. On the other side of the scale, human nature is such that – and no one consciously does this but – then when you go through these types of events, you realize, oh, it looks like we have some of the toughest ones waiting towards the end, because there may be clients, for example, that we approach and ask them to upgrade and they say, well, I don\'t want to do it now, call me in a quarter. And then, we are getting to the point now where we\'re going to have to migrate them or upgrade them. And so we probably have some of that as well. So I don\'t think there\'s an enormous amount of that. It\'s not like we only have the hard ones left and the ones who didn\'t want to go, but just being realistic in the sense that – and also deferent to our associates who have still a lot of hard work ahead of them over the next three quarters or so, because it\'s not going to be easy getting across the finish line. But our volumes now are at a more manageable level, where I think we\'re doing a much higher quality job. So we feel good about our ability to do it, but your questions are, I think, fair. And I think the answer is the scales are balanced. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Great. I appreciate the answer. And then, with regards to Vantage, how well positioned is that now for like once you get through this and you\'re going through the next stage of transitions, do you feel good about that solution as it currently stands? I know you\'re always innovating, always optimizing. Is it matters of degree in terms of getting it to exactly where you want? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I mean, to put it in perspective, we have about double the number of clients. I think it\'s up to 270 or 280, somewhere in the range, at the end of this quarter versus the same period last year. So I think that tells you something. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker) Yeah, that\'s great. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We would like it to be higher. And we would have liked it to have been higher by now, but I think we\'re still growing well. We had good growth in the quarter in terms of Vantage. So I mean, I think that in terms of the product itself, we\'re pretty happy with the progress we\'ve made, particularly over the last two or three releases. Again, we get a lot of metrics and a lot of data around stability and other factors, defects, et cetera, and we\'ve made a lot of progress. So it feels like the trajectory is in a positive direction for Vantage, not just growth-wise, but I think in terms of the underlying metrics that we measure around quality and stability. Operator Thank you. This concludes our Q&A session for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We thank you all for joining our call today. As you can tell, we got off to a really good start, on top of the great results. We\'re incredibly happy about the positive recognition we\'re getting in the marketplace, as you heard from some of my comments. It really helps us in terms of our thought leadership in the market. I think the investments we\'re making in our innovation efforts and also our simplification of our portfolio and aligning them to our service model, I think are going to yield great results for us. And I think we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute against those plans. The last thing I want to do is just acknowledge associates. We had a very tough year last year. I know I said it last quarter, but we had a challenging year. And we really appreciate all the efforts to continue to deliver great service to our clients. The commitment that our service associates have to our clients is unmatched, and it\'s one of the great strengths of ADP. So I just want to acknowledge them and give them my appreciation. And also, I want to thank all of you for joining us today and thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today\'s conference.

At this time, I\'d like to welcome everyone to ADP\'s second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Nicole. Good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\'s Vice President, Investor Relations. And I\'m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\'s President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jan Siegmund, ADP\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. Before we begin, you have noticed in this morning\'s earnings release that we are now including a breakout of PEO segment net revenue and pass-through revenue to assist you in updating your models ahead of your quarterly 10-Q filing. Please refer to Footnote B on the income statement for further details. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I\'d like to remind everyone that today\'s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2017 results, with revenue up 6% to $3 billion or 7% on a constant dollar basis. This quarter, we saw the continued benefits of strong prior period new business bookings and a strengthening in our retention metric which helped to drive organic revenue growth across all market segments. Our earnings growth exceeded our expectations this quarter with adjusted diluted earnings per share growing 20% to $0.87 per share. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our strong earnings performance in more detail shortly. During the quarter we experienced a decline of 5% in new business bookings compared to a strong second quarter in fiscal 2016. These results reflect a continued difficult grow-over related to the tailwinds from our fiscal 2016 sales of additional modules related to the Affordable Care Act, which was expected. Additionally, within the midmarket and upmarkets in particular we also experienced the effects of political uncertainty leading up to and following on from the November U.S. elections which slowed decision making among some clients and prospects during the quarter. Our value proposition remained wrong and we have a successful track record of managing change for our clients. As you have seen with ADP many times in the past, change can provide us with significant opportunities to grow and expand our solutions to help deepen our client relationships. We expect that the environment in 2017 and beyond will be no exception and at this current uncertainty and related hesitancy, will be a short-term phenomenon. Accordingly, we continue to expect new business bookings growth in the second half of fiscal 2017, but in light of the second quarter decline, we have now revised our outlook and now expect to be about flat for fiscal 2017 as compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal 2016. The client experience remains a priority for us whether it\'s through investments in our service model, in innovation and the user experience or in our efforts to upgrade clients with the most appropriate strategic based platforms, we believe that we have the right strategy to address these continuously evolving needs and opportunities and we remain pleased with the progress we are making. We continue to see the benefits of higher retention rates for clients on our strategic platforms and from our continued investments in service. Accordingly, this quarter retention increased in line with our expectations by about 10 basis points as we saw the benefits of these ongoing efforts help drive further improvements in client service metrics. But at the same time, we remain cautious as we enter the time of the year when clients in our industry are most likely to change providers. In January, we completed the acquisition of The Marcus Buckingham Company or TMBC, to expand our core talent portfolio. This relatively small, but strategic acquisition brings together ADP\'s robust dataset with TMBC\'s innovative talent solutions so as to help clients build a better and more engaged workforce. TMBC and its founder Marcus Buckingham are cutting-edge innovators in using data and research to drive talent management practices. Their cloud-based performance and talent management solution now known as ADP StandOut coupled applications with coaching and education to give leaders the tools, insights and data needed to improve employee and team performance. Feedback on this acquisition from many of our mutual Fortune 100 customers has been extremely positive. We look forward to delivering new data-driven solutions to the market that bring together the unique capabilities of ADP and TMBC. As we think about the future growth of ADP, we anticipate that investments such as these coupled with our ongoing organic investments in innovation, service and sales will enable us to continue to stay at the forefront of the HCM industry. Other examples of our innovative successes can be seen in the traction of our ADP DataCloud and ADP Mobile Solutions app. As you know, we introduced our ADP DataCloud to allow business leaders and HR professionals to generate actionable insights from the workforce data embedded in their ADP HCM solutions. Today, several thousand clients are using our DataCloud analytics platform and we continue to advance the solution with new capabilities. During the quarter, we added depth to the geographic benchmark data and added time and labor benchmarks such as market-based absence and overtime. These new benchmarks are unique within HCM and leverage our close to 30 million anatomized U.S. employee records to assist HR professionals in developing and fine-tuning their strategies. With respect to the ADP Mobile Solutions app, we recently announced the number of users has surpassed the 10 million mark. Our Mobile Solutions app is the most downloaded app in the HCM market with users spanning 200 countries. We\'ve continued to add new features and functionality to embrace the modern users\' needs from workers accessing stock profiles, editing team schedules or approving time-off requests to users changing their 401(k) contribution or viewing their account performance. Organizations know that employees expect technology to be easy to use and accessible from anywhere while simultaneously being powerful and secure. Our Mobile Solutions app is the first app of its kind and continues to be consistently among the top three business apps in Apple App Store. For the last couple of quarters, we\'ve been sharing our plans regarding our Service Alignment Initiative and I\'m excited to highlight for you that we\'ve been making great progress. During the last quarter, I took part in the opening of our new service and implementation facility in Norfolk, Virginia. We welcomed more than 400 associates to a new signature building and anticipate our presence in Norfolk will ultimately reach 1,800 associates. We are similarly on track in hiring in Orlando where we expect to eventually have about 1,600 associates. Also during the quarter, we announced our third new strategic service center in Tempe, Arizona. We anticipate opening that facility in the spring of 2017 with a capacity of 1,500 associates in that location. These new centers are a critical component of our overall service strategy and will enable us to significantly enhance ADP\'s service capabilities across the HCM spectrum. Lastly, before I turn the call over to Jan, I would like to add how gratified we are for the recognition we continue to receive from the HCM industry and the customers we serve. During the quarter, ADP received the Everest Group\'s highest recognition for our GlobalView HCM solution. Their report recognized us for the scalability of our solution while noting ADP\'s reporting, analytics and mobile app are key differentiators for us. In addition, ADP DataCloud earned a Cloud Computing Innovation Award from Ventana Research, recognizing our ability to deliver positive business impact. In bestowing the award, Ventana noted ADP\'s ability to provide organizations with data that can reveal the workforce trends and provide the deep insights needed to make better business decisions. In closing, despite the recent uncertainty in the U.S. business environment, we continue to believe that change will be beneficial to us as we are well-positioned to help our clients navigate the complexities of HCM. I remain confident in ADP\'s future and in the success of our strategic initiatives. In fact, I believe that we\'re in a firm position for sustained growth and success as we continue to make the technology and service investments to further increase the strategic value of the HR function. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our second quarter results and an update to our fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, during the quarter we completed the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and realized a pre-tax gain of $205 million. The historical results of these businesses are reported in the Employer Services segment and are not reported as discontinued operations. Furthermore, we recorded a $1 million restructuring charge related to our Service Alignment Initiative. Certain non-GAAP measures in my commentary to follow exclude the impact of these two items as well as certain other one-time items recognized in the prior fiscal year. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures can be found in this morning\'s press release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As Carlos mentioned, ADP revenues grew 6% in the quarter to $3 billion or 7% on a constant dollar basis. Net earnings grew 50% to $511 million on a reported basis or 49% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 17% or 16% on a constant dollar basis. Adjusted EBIT margin increased about 180 basis points compared to the 18% in last year\'s second quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and slower growth in our selling expenses. Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 20% to $0.87 or 19% on a constant dollar basis and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. New business bookings this quarter were down 5% partially due to the difficult selling compare in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016, but also from an elevated level of buyer uncertainty around the November U.S. elections leading to a slowing of buying decisions in our mid and up markets. As Carlos mentioned, our retention was up by 10 basis points in this quarter, and we are pleased with the progress that we have been making with our midmarket initiative and the continued strength of our retention on our strategic platforms. I would like to caution you that retention on a quarterly basis remains a volatile metric. Our full-year guidance takes into account known losses and anticipated losses. Overall, we are pleased with our results in this quarter stemming from solid underlying revenue growth with better than expected margin growth and an improvement in our client retention. Although we are disappointed with our overall new business bookings performance this quarter, we continue to believe in the underlying strength of our distribution model as well as our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 4% on a reported and constant dollar basis for the quarter. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.3% in the second quarter. Average client funds balances grew 2% on a reported and constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. This growth was driven by net new business and increased wage levels compared to prior year\'s second quarter. Outside the U.S., we continue to see solid revenue growth and margin growth, largely driven by the success of our multinational solutions, which continue to perform well. Employer Services margin increased about 150 basis points in the quarter. This increase was driven by operational efficiencies and slower growth in our selling expenses following on from the difficult selling compare in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. PEO revenues grew by 12% in the quarter, with the average worksite employees growing 12% to 452,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in benefit pass-through costs resulting from lower healthcare renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation from our worksite employees during the quarter. PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies and slower growth in selling expenses, both of which helped drive approximately 120 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. We anticipate we will return to a growth trajectory in new business bookings in the second half of fiscal year 2017. However, as a result of the second quarter decline, we are now forecasting fiscal year 2017 new business bookings to be about flat compared with our prior forecast of 4% to 6% growth. As a result of this change to our expectations, we have updated certain elements of our fiscal year 2017 forecast. As a result of our revised new business bookings guidance and slower growth in our PEO-related pass-through revenues, we now anticipate total revenue growth of about 6% compared with our prior forecast of 7% to 8%. This revised outlook includes almost one percentage point of expected combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses, which occurred towards the end of the second quarter, and the impacts from foreign currency due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We have adjusted our revenue forecast for the Employer Services revenue growth to 3% to 4% compared with our prior forecast of 4% to 5%, which included almost one percentage point of expected pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. Separately, as a result of the slower growth in our PEO pass-through related revenue, we now anticipate PEO revenue growth of 13% compared with our prior forecast of 14% to 16%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our Service Alignment Initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, as a result of our lower revenue growth forecast, we now anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 to 50 basis points compared to our prior forecast of about 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full-year basis. Accordingly, we now expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion to be at least 100 basis points compared to our previous forecast of about 75 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client fund interest revenue to increase about $15 million compared to our prior forecasted increase of $5 million to $10 million. The total impact from the client funds Extended Investment Strategy is now expected to be up about $10 million compared to the prior forecast of $5 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. We continue to expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13% compared with the $3.26 in fiscal year 2016, aided by about one percentage point from tax benefits related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, which is offset by about one percentage point of earnings impact from the disposition of our CHSA and COBRA businesses. Our forecast now contemplates a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, subject to market conditions, during fiscal year 2017, compared to our prior forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. We believe that the adjustments we have made to our fiscal year 2017 forecast reflect the impact of our planned investments, particularly through the year-end process, as we work to grow over our strong fiscal year 2016 new business bookings performance and execute against our strategic initiatives. So with that, I will turn it over to the operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We\'ll take our first question from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to start with you, Carlos, in terms of the bookings pressure that you saw post-election, I think you highlighted that that pressure mainly came in the midmarket and upmarket segments. Can you maybe talk about your level of confidence that you\'re going to see a recovery, what you saw in January, and then also was that a departure from what you saw in the downmarket and small business? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a great question. Obviously, there are two factors that are affecting the growth in our new business bookings. One was the known factor which is the difficult grow-over and obviously, we had some sense of that and factored it in in terms of our guidance for the year because we were obviously below our long-term 8% to 10% as a result of what we knew was going to be a more limited base to sell into since we had already sold half of our clients on ACA. So that was a known factor, but the reality is we didn\'t know exactly how much difficulty we would have in selling additional modules of ACA over what we sold last year. So that is a factor that obviously has become more difficult to measure given the talk of the administration of repeal and replace of ACA. So I guess, in a nutshell, whatever we assumed about the difficult grow-over, I think, it became a much more difficult grow-over as we think many companies in the midmarket and upmarket are probably – have a wait-and-see attitude in terms of what\'s going to happen around the Affordable Care Act. I think that there\'s also this kind of second factor which obviously we have no scientific way of measuring which feels like people are in general just delaying and waiting to see what happens not just with ACA, but with a variety of other things that the administration is talking about. Having said all that, there are also a lot of positive things and we see that reflected in some of the public markets or the equity markets in terms of anticipation of lower tax rates and fiscal stimulus and so forth. And in particular, one of the things that I noted, I\'ve seen a chart that shows – I believe it\'s the NFIB confidence index, but small business confidence indexes are kind of off the charts positive and in a strange way, it\'s a little bit reflective of kind of what we\'re experiencing which is continued success which we don\'t give guidance by segment, but we have very good and strong new business bookings results in our down market and not so much in our mid and upmarket. And of course, the PEO, we generally consider to be a down market business but that business does have obviously a relationship to ACA and what\'s going on around regulation and the variety of regulations that had been talked about previously that now may be subject to change on a go-forward basis. So there\'s a lot of moving parts and hopefully that provides you a little bit of color, but we don\'t have really great precise scientific tool to be able to ascertain how much of the weakness is coming from each factor. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. That\'s helpful. And then maybe just on a kind of looking forward basis, you talked about some of the small business confidence indicators, NFIB, et cetera. Can you maybe talk about the broad effect of other potential administration policies or congressional action that might either be a tailwind or headwind over the next few quarters? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Sure. I mean, the most obvious one is this the discussion around the Affordable Care Act, so we – as I mentioned in my prepared comments, ADP generally does well when there\'s change, but not when there\'s uncertainty about change. And so I think a protracted debate about what replacement means or what will be happening is probably not helpful to us in terms of our new business bookings results. There are a number of other items out there around, for example, overtime rules, EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] reporting around pay equity and even DOL rules around the fiduciary responsibility that affects our retirement services business. So there\'s a number of things that are in play by the administration, generally speaking over 67 years we have benefited from whether it\'s one particular party or another particular party or one philosophy versus another philosophy because generally there\'s change, there\'s constant change and I think, employers use services like ours to help them manage through that change. So we, on a medium to long-term basis, are, I think, optimistic that whatever form comes of healthcare reform whether it\'s more state based or just a different way of providing because I think the administration appears to be committed to maintaining the number of people that have insurance so that will require some form of tracking and some form of enforcement or tax credits and it maybe more state based, but that\'s something that we hope to be able to help our clients navigate through when the administration and Congress, I think, get further along in terms of figuring out what exactly they want to do. And there\'s a number of other regulations that are probably less public and less significant on an individual new business bookings basis, but they all add up to quite a lot of bit of potential change which I think would be very good for ADP. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And Jim, if I add on the revenue risk that we might have for this year, I would consider that as minimal so our clients that are subscribing to our ACA solutions obviously are preparing for their filings in this fiscal year and anecdotal evidence is that our clients really look forward to ADP to help them through that change. So the actual revenue risk for this fiscal year, I would describe, as minimal. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. As you can see from our retention notes, we haven\'t add – I think, Jan makes a great point which is what\'s fascinating is obviously the challenge for us right now is the new business bookings, but we haven\'t had cancellations or in fact we have clients that are still being implemented on ACA, but it\'s natural that once you\'ve made a decision and you\'re committed and you\'re on the path and it is the law, by the way, it still is the law, it makes sense to go forward, but I can see how some people, if they\'re doing it in-house or doing it themselves might be hesitant to make a decision given the uncertainty around what\'s actually going to happen regarding the law. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah. Thanks. Just following up on the comments about the PEO business. I wasn\'t clear because you said down market, you did well and I consider that down market, but it also seems like you\'re saying that was another area where bookings growth was a little slower. Could you clarify and, I guess, elaborate on that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, I didn\'t say the new business bookings growth was weak in the PEO, we don\'t give segment reporting with details of our bookings. I was just trying to give you a general flavor because, as you saw, we also had some weakness on the revenue growth, but that wasn\'t necessarily related to ACA, but just in general, I was trying to convey that there is some logical, I guess, explanation to some of what\'s happening in the sense that there appears to be a lot of optimism on the part of small businesses and we\'re seeing that reflected in parts of our business. In other parts of the business the results are mixed because we do, I think, see as a result of the fact that 50% of the PEO\'s business comes from referrals of our existing payroll sales force, to the extent that that sales force is encountering some slower decision-making, particularly in the midmarket, and also encountering some slow decision-making as a result of uncertainty about ACA that is expected to have and is having some impact on the PEO. But to be clear, the weakness in the revenue growth of the PEO was almost exclusively the pass-through revenues and lower inflation in health benefits and a slight slowing in benefits participation which is probably also related to a, quote unquote, peaking of ACA implementations. And by that I mean that we have seen several year decline in benefits participation rate, in other words how many eligible employees of the PEO actually take benefits and that sort of the trend upward as we got closer to the deadline. So the last, call it, two years right before ACA, given the fact that the law was intended to increase participation and companies were coming to the PEO in order to comply with the law, we saw those participation rates trend up. And now we saw the increase in the second quarter be a smaller increase than in the prior second quarter and in the quarters before that. So that slowing trend of benefits participation coupled with lower inflation of benefits per worksite employee is what led to slower growth, if you will, in the PEO, but the 12% worksite employee growth is still very, very strong, so we\'re still very happy with what we consider to be net revenue growth in the PEO which is now growing almost in line with worksite employees whereas historically had grown a little bit faster because of this pass-through cost pressure. So I hope that helps a little bit... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I just have one piece of information for you, Tim, is the average client size in the PEO is now around mid 40s, so it spans really the small business space as well as our midmarket up to a couple hundred employees per client, so it\'s affected by performance in down and midmarket in its growth. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. And then just following up on the comment about the mid to upper markets, I understand retention was a little better overall for you, so you retained existing customers, but do you have enough data to know that – I guess, it was slower decision-making or a lack of decision by clients versus competitive win losses on new opportunities that had an impact this quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We monitor obviously our competitive position in the market space and I think we have seen performance competitively according to our expectations. One element that Carlos had not mentioned is, I think, our sales force has reported relatively strong pipelines overall throughout these months, so it was really not due to a lack of interest, but it was really what we felt a slowing of the decision-making process as we forecasted certainly, but also those things together, solid competitive position as well as good pipeline gave us basically the basis for the forecast that we just made. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And it\'s certainly isn\'t for lack of head count, so we\'re in a strong position from a sales force capability standpoint. And I think if your question was really around did our retention – I think, you started off by asking about retention, did retention benefit from slower decision, that\'s possible. So it is possible that on the other side of the coin, if you will, people didn\'t make as many decisions than we were able to hold on to clients, it\'d have very difficult for us to measure that, but it\'s possible. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Barclays. Your line is now open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions, just real quick here, you\'ve seen about 200 basis points margin expansion during the first two quarters of the year. Obviously, when it compares to your guidance, are up 50 basis points and implies a meaningful contraction in the second half. Could you just walk us through the drivers of that and the contribution to margins perhaps that are tied to ACA products in the quarter or anything else that you\'d like to call out? And then just kind of keeping with that theme, you\'ve talked about pass-through pressure being better than anticipated, helping to drive margin expansion there. And so just thinking about margins overall with PEO growing much faster than Employer Services which has got a meaningfully lower margin, how do we think about the sustainability of like 50 basis points a year over time? Like what\'s ultimately driving expansion against the PEO headwind? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. James, that is a fairly comprehensive margin question, I would say. So let me start, I think you are isolating some of the factors that create more margin pressure in the second half of our fiscal year. So number one is the easier compare that we had in the first half of the fiscal year due to our ACA related investments is clear. So in the beginning of 2016 fiscal year we had largely selling and implementation expense for ACA and then we started to receive revenues for these products in the third and fourth quarter of last fiscal year. And so the upcoming quarters don\'t have that easier compare and so the margin expansion that we experienced in the first two quarters is not going to repeat itself due to the growing into our more steady ACA revenue base. Secondly, we expect of course sales to grow as we indicated in our prepared remarks, and so that means of course also selling expense is anticipated to grow and in this case contribute to the margin pressure. And we\'re also continuing our investments into product and innovation, which is in this case at an equal basis contributing to the margin pressure. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think we also have – I think our expectation is a little bit of a return of the growth of the PEO pass-through cost, which I think that just mathematically also adds to – I think the last part of your question was a broad PEO margin pressure question about ADP, but in this first half, second half it is a factor. Based on our current forecast, just the expectation for our pass-through cost for the second half alone causes some pressure in the second half. And I think your broader question about overall pressure is a very, very good question which we spend a lot of time looking at and talking about. But this year in particular, because of lower benefits inflation costs, we actually, as you could tell from the first half of the year, it actually helped us. It took some of the pressure that we had historically had off. So even though the PEO has an absolute lower margin, the fact that its margin has been improving as much as it has combined with the slower growth of pass-through costs made this a moot point for the first two quarters of this year. And I think what you have from us is a commitment to really make sure that we have a lot of transparency around because we do a lot of what-if scenarios around the next two to three years what the PEO margin expectation is versus the ES margin expectation and the overall ADP. And we feel comfortable at least right now that we are in a place where we\'re able to still achieve the guidance that we\'ve provided on a long-term basis, but over time that could change. If we have a lot of inflation and pass-through costs, we might have to revisit that topic just because of the pure mathematics, not because of the quality of the business or the strength of the business, just because of the math that I think you\'re implying. But I think for now, I think we\'re in an okay position. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks a lot, that\'s really helpful. I know I threw a lot at you there. Just real quick, a much shorter question, just what\'s driving the unchanged EPS guide? That was obviously nice to see. You raised it last quarter, and you were able to keep it steady here despite declining top line. Is it just tax rate and a step up in buybacks versus prior expectations or maybe some conservatism on your end in the past, or something else that maybe I\'m missing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. No, I think that – Jan may have something to add, but we had a great quarter earnings-wise, so that helps because we obviously provide guidance based on what we really think is going to happen. And as I think we were clear in our comments, the second quarter exceeded our expectation. So in fairness, we got a little bit of tailwind from the second quarter going into "maintaining" our guidance for the year on earnings. So I think we feel good about where we are in terms of our expenses, even though Jan described very well this issue of we\'ve lapped our ACA revenues, and we had already lapped our ACA expenses for the last two quarters. So those kind of factors are what helped boost the margins in the first two quarters of the fiscal year which we don\'t get in the second two quarters of the fiscal year. But in general when we look at the quality and the trajectory of the business, we feel pretty good other than this issue in new business bookings, which ironically helps our margin in the first half of the fiscal year. Other than that factor, we feel pretty good about where we are. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks a lot. I appreciate your time. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Good morning. Let me follow that up with one more question about margins. Can you give us a sense, how much of the margin improvement this quarter was the operating efficiencies versus the lower sales commissions? I noticed you said them in that order. So was that done by design based on the impact? And then what were the costs in the quarter and the first half I guess for the service alignment changes? And is it still that the vast majority of that cost has not happened yet happens in the back half? Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Let me start about the Service Alignment Initiative. The Service Alignment Initiative causes us in the fiscal year to take a restructuring charge of approximately $100 million throughout, and we took the first 40-some million dollars in the first quarter and just very little in the second quarter. In addition to those restructuring costs, we incur about a 20 bps margin pressure through dual operations, which is not part of the non-GAAP measure. And that is incurring throughout the fiscal year, so there\'s not a great variation in this throughout. The second question to you, about 0.5%, a little less than 0.5% of the margin improvement in the first half is due to our lower MDE – our lower selling expense – selling and marketing expense in the first half, and then about 120 basis points was operating efficiencies of scale. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. And then just a quick follow-up, on the bookings, is there any way to have any confidence that this is really short-term driven related to uncertainty around the election rather than the changes that come out of the new administration dampening demand for the product? So the overtime rules, ACA you\'ve already been clear on. I think we understand that. But do you get that kind of color from clients, or is it more you think just no one wanted to step up because there was and probably still is so much uncertainty? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. While we have noodled this question now a number of ways, I tried to add a few elements to it. If the changes in economic policy lead to sustained economic growth, that is the most important driver for our success of new business bookings. So if the belief that is currently I guess reflected in bullish equity markets and other things, business confidence comes true, I think that will be naturally a good thing because we are positively correlated to good economic environment, and good employment helps ADP. So the fundamental – that\'s the most important driver for our new business bookings growth is a healthy economic environment. Now economic – changes in the regulatory environment contribute maybe to economic growth and they also contribute to change in regulatory requirements in the HR space, which help ADP. I would guess that change will happen over time and the number of changes that are coming down to our clients is high, so I don\'t think there\'s a principal change in need for compliance solutions in the HR space to be foreseen in any near-term future. So net-net, I think, if the economic positive outcome materializes, I think that will be good news for ADP overall and we remain confident in our ability to sell. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Jan, I think to add to that, I think we have some historical data to support Jan\'s points like, obviously, we don\'t have any historical data to really be able to ascertain what\'s happening, what month and with what regulation. But the first point about the economy is indisputable that when ADP is obviously a very – from a recurring revenue model standpoint on our revenues and our profitability and so forth a relatively defensive steady company, but new business bookings is a little bit different. And when you look at 20 years of data, our new business bookings growth over the course of rolling four quarters because obviously any one quarter can have issues like we just experienced. We can have a new regulation that requires a new product. We had for example Y2K 20 years ago but, in general, follows very, very closely almost a smooth line what\'s happening with the economy, as does our pays per control growth. So our pays per control growth when unemployment is going up, tends to go down and vice versa. So we are in new business bookings, I think, somewhat tied to the strength of the economy and so, as Jan said – and we are, obviously, we try to be as transparent as possible. We were sitting here talking about potentially entering a recession. We would have to, I think, temper our optimism based on that 20 years of history. But since that doesn\'t appear to be the environment that we\'re entering at least for now, we feel that we\'re going to rely on this historical data and I think plan on returning to historical growth rates in our new business, and our new business bookings. In terms of this issue of the specific regulations and change and so forth, there\'s also a lot of history in ADP. There\'s more than 20 years of history where even though there are bumps along the road in terms of the amount of regulation and the type of regulation, in general the trajectory has been in one direction. And that\'s a global statement, not just a U.S. statement because governments try to effect public policy through employment and through employers, whether it\'s around safety, or taxes, or a variety of healthcare in this case. And so we like where we are, we like the space we operate in, and we\'re optimistic about, I think, the future, although obviously, we\'re not exactly happy about what\'s happening in the short term here. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great, thank you. I appreciate all color. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about the timeline and monetization model for the rollout of your reporting and benchmarking modules? Exactly where they are in terms of rolling out and just directionally what the magnitude is that you expect coming in from those modules in terms of new business bookings and revenues over time? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Lisa, yeah, our big data and analytics capabilities we view as one of our strategic differentiators in our product set. And we\'re planning actually to capture the benefit of this capability that is quite unique in a variety of methods. And the most fundamental is that we\'re going to be incorporating many of those analytics, benchmarking and predictive analytics, into our core product and differentiate the core bundle with a better solution. So for example, data and DataCloud is an integral part of our Vantage offering and is available to all Vantage clients, and is part of what makes Vantage a differentiated product. In the mid-market we\'re selling it as an incremental module for now, and clients buy it on a recurring revenue basis. We have a few thousand clients having bought the product in the last 12 months or so. So we\'re kind of in the very early stages of rolling out these capabilities to it. I encourage everybody to think about the data analytics capability as a broad differentiator that will not only affect our core product for our clients, will improve our service and implementation capabilities, and will be – we\'re kind of right now in the very beginning stages of seeing those benefits coming through. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And I think – I\'ll just add that I think we are working on these types of products and others in order to drive not just incremental revenue from the products themselves, but to gain market share and to win more new business. Because the reality is that when we wake up every morning we\'re thinking about how you grow over $1.75 billion in new business bookings. And to give you a specific answer like in the next year or two we don\'t plan on sharing on this call that it had the same impact as ACA. Because again, the numbers are just so large that unless we simultaneously generate incremental revenues from new products, while driving – using those new products to drive better differentiation and more net new wins in the marketplace to gain market share, then we\'re not going to be able to grow the business. I think Jan described it well which is it\'s a very broad strategy around differentiation and strengthening our products, as well as we don\'t mind earning a little bit of extra revenue and income from selling those types of products. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thanks, and then just quickly for my follow-up, can you give the 20 second update on the Workforce Now migrations and whether you\'re still on track to finish them by the end of the year? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yes, we\'re still on track. We feel pretty good. I think, Jan, may have the... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We\'re steered away from the digital numbers here, but we\'re committed to substantially complete the migrations in our-market space by the end of the fiscal year. And I think we\'re going to have a few stragglers into the first quarter, but substantially we are on plan with those migrations. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And very excited about it. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Good morning. Just, I guess, on the bookings front, have you changed your assumption on bookings specific to selling additional ACA modules? I think in the past, you\'ve said that you\'ve sold about half your ACA base already there. Does this shift to flat bookings cover that? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yes, it does. So one big chunk, of course, is the adjustment to our selling expense expectations that we had for that product. As you might imagine that is significantly down and our new guidance incorporates that thinking. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Thanks, Jan. And then on the – just the acquisition of the Marcus research – Buckingham, is it more of a people-based, so I get the technology side of it. But it seems like they do some consulting and perhaps some people-based services as well at this Marcus Buckingham Company. I\'m just curious if you can give a little more on the addition there? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So we like it so much because there\'s a service component in addition to a technology component which actually fits well with our business model, so you\'re right. There is a – they have deep, deep data analytics and insights in their own business, and so there\'s a lot of research-based, data-driven decision-making in how they deliver their products. I think the belief by them and by us is that we have obviously a very big data set to be able to enhance the work that they do to really help people create a better workforce. And so I think the combination of the coaching, the data and the analytics along with combining that with ADP, I think, we think that we could really do something special here. So again, caution that given the $12 billion of revenue, if it wasn\'t obvious from our comments, this is not an immediate game changer from a revenue growth standpoint, but it\'s an immediate game changer from a strategic standpoint and from a brand standpoint. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Right. Yeah, no. It seems powerful to put on top of your platform. Thank you. Go ahead. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is now open. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Thank you. So just to put the bookings provision in context, it seems that everything else being equal the impact is less than $100 million of annualized revenue given the booking space. Are we thinking about that right? And I know it\'s still early, but is there anything else we should think about in the context of next year\'s revenue growth trajectory other than obviously the easier comparison? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. No. I think that that\'s as good a math as – for example, when we had some challenges with retention in the last year, that\'s kind of the way to look at things is to use simple math to put things in perspective. And so we obviously fully expect to return to stronger new business bookings growth as these compares get a little bit easier and hopefully as some of this uncertainty wears off, but I think that your math is dead on, which is why you hear us still remaining optimistic. We would obviously prefer to have $100 million then to not have the $100 million, but I think in the context of what we\'re trying to accomplish for the company from a value generation standpoint, EPS, share buybacks, et cetera, it really doesn\'t – for now, it doesn\'t have a major impact. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And, David, while that quantitative estimate is that kind of scopes it, but obviously, key assumptions for revenue growth also are impacted by your belief in retention as well as we pointed out in this point of time of year, in particular around the pass-through revenue growth of the POE, those would be the two other factors that I think could have meaningful or somehow an impact on your revenue growth expectations for the longer term. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Right. And then just secondly, and I may have missed this, you may have mentioned this, but I was just looking, pays per control were roughly in line with trends, so just trying to understand the context of where the weakness was, if you can call this out? But was it primarily in unit growth? Or was it revenue per client? Or is it just kind of both without any real noticeable trend? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. You\'re referring to new business bookings? Or... David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Yes. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I\'m not sure I understand, sorry, the question. The... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think we indicated that we had new business bookings weakness in the mid and up market. That was stronger impacted by the slowing of the buying decisions. And if you refer – I think, I can tell you that our client growth continues to be very solid, mostly driven by our success in the down market, so really very nice performance in the small business market with unit growth. So mathematically, I guess, what it boils down is a mix of all of that together. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Okay. So just then looking at the mid and up market then, Jan, was there any real distinction between unit growth and revenue per client in terms of the shortfall? Or was it just a combination of both? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. No. Not really. Not a change. I think both fell a little bit short. Clearly, it\'s always clouded right now by this difficult compare about the ACA, and we have emphasized this in a number of calls. The ACA modules themselves are easy to identify, but ACA has triggered a lot of buying decisions for broader product bundles. And it\'s hard to analytically differentiate between what was the true ACA impact and what was just enhanced buying cycles because this triggered a buying event in what was just regular course of business. So we\'re a little bit hesitant to say that. But overall, in the mid and upmarket, I think we have seen continuation of trends and new logo growth as we call it and upselling. It\'s just at a lower level. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Jan, I think that – sorry. Maybe I didn\'t at first understand the question, but I did look last night at sales force productivity over the last few years. And as you can imagine, now our average productivity per sales rep is down, but largely driven by ACA. If you exclude ACA, our sales productivity is still in line with our expectations. So I think what we\'ve had is we had – and I think we\'ve been every quarter I think very, very clear. We haven\'t been pretending that it was either sustainable or that we had done something magical to all of a sudden create such a huge increase in productivity in our sales force. I wish we had. Clearly, we got help from and lift from ACA sales. We had two years of 13% and 12% new business bookings growth, fiscal years, and I don\'t know the last time that we had ever done that. So clearly, maybe we didn\'t emphasize enough how much help we were getting. And certainly now it\'s difficult to go back to the sales force and remind them that we had help and now the help isn\'t there anymore. We\'ve got to now focus on fundamentals. We\'ve got to go back to selling new clients and the old-fashioned approach of ADP of having a reasonable mix of head count growth and productivity growth. And I think when I look through the numbers and try to normalize for ACA, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of head count and also sales force productivity. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane, Bank of America. Your line is now open. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Sure, good morning. Over the last few years, ADP has leaned pretty heavily on regulatory and compliance offerings. As the U.S. labor market looks to tighten and perhaps wage inflation picks up, what are some of the more growth-oriented offerings that you have for clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s actually a fantastic question because this afternoon I\'m actually going to speak to our midmarket sales force about some of the things that we can and need to do in terms of getting ourselves reset here for a different environment. I think, as we said multiple times today, we\'re not going to a zero regulation environment. So 99% of the laws and regulations that affect employers are still in place today that were in place two months ago, and they\'re probably going to be in place a year and five years from now, and there may be new ones. And so we have always been there to help our clients with compliance and with regulation. Having said that, we\'re clearly entering a period of time with tightening labor markets where I think many employers\' attention is going to turn to how to attract and retain a workforce. And this is something that we\'ve been building to over the last four to five, six, seven years by investing in our talent management suites. by investing in tools to help our clients use data and analytics to run their business better and manage a better workforce. So we\'ve been preparing fortunately for this strategic opportunity here for many years, and it\'s coming and it\'s coming fast because I believe we reported the ADP Employment Report this morning, and that\'s only going to add to I think the tighter labor markets. Because as we\'ve seen multiple times in the last 20 to 30 years, as unemployment gets to the level that it\'s at now and we understand that there might still be a little bit of slack as a result of labor force participation, but that slack will also inevitably come out of the system, whether it\'s in 6 months or in 12 months. It may have already come out, we don\'t know. But besides higher interest rates, which are going to be beneficial to ADP, we think this is going to be beneficial to ADP\'s new business bookings and to our approach to the market, which is to help our clients and products exactly with this topic. How do you attract and retain the best workforce when everyone else is trying to do the same thing? So we\'re not ready to say there\'s a war for talent yet, but clearly there are pockets of that. And I think when that happens, I think some of the products and solutions that we\'ve developed, this acquisition that we\'ve just done with TMBC, I think, position us well to help our clients with that. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. And then I know that the revenue contribution from the acquisition is pretty small, but bigger picture you\'ve been focused mainly on organic development over the last few years. Should we read this acquisition as potentially suggesting you\'re open to a bit more tuck-in acquisitions going forward? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think we always have maintained a position that we view our balance sheet and our capital strength as one of our assets, and we have been evaluating and looking at acquisitions all along. And so you should anticipate that we\'ll keep an open mind around those going forward, and they will need now a joint evaluation of augmenting us strategically, like the talent management acquisition of Marcus Buckingham fits right into this talent search, manage your workforce better, so strategically fitting well, but also not adding in a disproportionate way to the complexity of our operations as we have focused so much to simplify our varying environment. And we\'re going to, as a management team, evaluate those acquisitions to maximize the value really eventually for the shareholder over time. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi. This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just to follow up on questions regarding the ACA, the new administration is pretty keen on repealing the ACA, and I was wondering. Is there a way to quantify what percentage of ADP\'s existing revenue may be directly or indirectly linked to ACA, like the ACA module or other revenues which may be linked to ACA and could be potentially impacted by the repeal? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We have reported that last year we filed for approximately 10 million employees 1095 forms, so that gives you a rough revenue estimate, between $150 million and $200 million of ACA revenue in our business. But it is with very – we have to be very thoughtful about what will happen to them. Clearly, it could go away, but it could also maintain new solutions, certain reporting requirements which are at the core of the value proposition of the ACA. So we at this point are really not in a position to estimate what part of this revenue is at risk or if there could be even further growth in that ACA revenue, but it gives you a rough estimate about the size of our directly ACA-related revenues, about $150 million to $200 million. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the color. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So as we mentioned, obviously some of the uncertainties that have been created as a result of this change in administration and the talk about repeal and replace of ACA are certainly not helping us in terms of our new business bookings here in the second quarter, but we still are pretty positive about our business model. I think you\'ve heard that from us today that we\'re well positioned for helping our clients with what are becoming very, very tight labor markets, and we\'re also optimistic that there will be some change. We know there\'s going to be change, so repeal is clearly in the eye of the beholder, but given that there\'s a commitment to maintaining 20 million Americans on insurance we believe there will be some new form of tracking of regulation and that we will have something that we can help our clients with if not the current ACA products that we have today. In the meantime, we\'re going to rely on our historical track record of being able to navigate through obviously these uncertain times and wait for the inevitable pickup in the economic activity as well as government activity around some of these changes. We continue to invest in simplifying our portfolio, as Jan said, including using that as one of the criteria for acquisitions. You\'ve heard us talk about how we\'re aligning our service model. We\'re very excited about what that\'s going to do for the quality and long term cost of our service, and as you heard from us today, we\'re certainly not backing down on our distribution channel. So we continue to invest in our sales force and grow our sales force because we plan on continuing to grow. So we appreciate your time today. Thank you for joining us, and we appreciate your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program.

We\'ll take our first question from the line of Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe to start with you, Carlos, in terms of the bookings pressure that you saw post-election, I think you highlighted that that pressure mainly came in the midmarket and upmarket segments. Can you maybe talk about your level of confidence that you\'re going to see a recovery, what you saw in January, and then also was that a departure from what you saw in the downmarket and small business? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a great question. Obviously, there are two factors that are affecting the growth in our new business bookings. One was the known factor which is the difficult grow-over and obviously, we had some sense of that and factored it in in terms of our guidance for the year because we were obviously below our long-term 8% to 10% as a result of what we knew was going to be a more limited base to sell into since we had already sold half of our clients on ACA. So that was a known factor, but the reality is we didn\'t know exactly how much difficulty we would have in selling additional modules of ACA over what we sold last year. So that is a factor that obviously has become more difficult to measure given the talk of the administration of repeal and replace of ACA. So I guess, in a nutshell, whatever we assumed about the difficult grow-over, I think, it became a much more difficult grow-over as we think many companies in the midmarket and upmarket are probably – have a wait-and-see attitude in terms of what\'s going to happen around the Affordable Care Act. I think that there\'s also this kind of second factor which obviously we have no scientific way of measuring which feels like people are in general just delaying and waiting to see what happens not just with ACA, but with a variety of other things that the administration is talking about. Having said all that, there are also a lot of positive things and we see that reflected in some of the public markets or the equity markets in terms of anticipation of lower tax rates and fiscal stimulus and so forth. And in particular, one of the things that I noted, I\'ve seen a chart that shows – I believe it\'s the NFIB confidence index, but small business confidence indexes are kind of off the charts positive and in a strange way, it\'s a little bit reflective of kind of what we\'re experiencing which is continued success which we don\'t give guidance by segment, but we have very good and strong new business bookings results in our down market and not so much in our mid and upmarket. And of course, the PEO, we generally consider to be a down market business but that business does have obviously a relationship to ACA and what\'s going on around regulation and the variety of regulations that had been talked about previously that now may be subject to change on a go-forward basis. So there\'s a lot of moving parts and hopefully that provides you a little bit of color, but we don\'t have really great precise scientific tool to be able to ascertain how much of the weakness is coming from each factor. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. That\'s helpful. And then maybe just on a kind of looking forward basis, you talked about some of the small business confidence indicators, NFIB, et cetera. Can you maybe talk about the broad effect of other potential administration policies or congressional action that might either be a tailwind or headwind over the next few quarters? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Sure. I mean, the most obvious one is this the discussion around the Affordable Care Act, so we – as I mentioned in my prepared comments, ADP generally does well when there\'s change, but not when there\'s uncertainty about change. And so I think a protracted debate about what replacement means or what will be happening is probably not helpful to us in terms of our new business bookings results. There are a number of other items out there around, for example, overtime rules, EEOC [Equal Employment Opportunity Commission] reporting around pay equity and even DOL rules around the fiduciary responsibility that affects our retirement services business. So there\'s a number of things that are in play by the administration, generally speaking over 67 years we have benefited from whether it\'s one particular party or another particular party or one philosophy versus another philosophy because generally there\'s change, there\'s constant change and I think, employers use services like ours to help them manage through that change. So we, on a medium to long-term basis, are, I think, optimistic that whatever form comes of healthcare reform whether it\'s more state based or just a different way of providing because I think the administration appears to be committed to maintaining the number of people that have insurance so that will require some form of tracking and some form of enforcement or tax credits and it maybe more state based, but that\'s something that we hope to be able to help our clients navigate through when the administration and Congress, I think, get further along in terms of figuring out what exactly they want to do. And there\'s a number of other regulations that are probably less public and less significant on an individual new business bookings basis, but they all add up to quite a lot of bit of potential change which I think would be very good for ADP. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And Jim, if I add on the revenue risk that we might have for this year, I would consider that as minimal so our clients that are subscribing to our ACA solutions obviously are preparing for their filings in this fiscal year and anecdotal evidence is that our clients really look forward to ADP to help them through that change. So the actual revenue risk for this fiscal year, I would describe, as minimal. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. As you can see from our retention notes, we haven\'t add – I think, Jan makes a great point which is what\'s fascinating is obviously the challenge for us right now is the new business bookings, but we haven\'t had cancellations or in fact we have clients that are still being implemented on ACA, but it\'s natural that once you\'ve made a decision and you\'re committed and you\'re on the path and it is the law, by the way, it still is the law, it makes sense to go forward, but I can see how some people, if they\'re doing it in-house or doing it themselves might be hesitant to make a decision given the uncertainty around what\'s actually going to happen regarding the law. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Your line is now open. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah. Thanks. Just following up on the comments about the PEO business. I wasn\'t clear because you said down market, you did well and I consider that down market, but it also seems like you\'re saying that was another area where bookings growth was a little slower. Could you clarify and, I guess, elaborate on that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, I didn\'t say the new business bookings growth was weak in the PEO, we don\'t give segment reporting with details of our bookings. I was just trying to give you a general flavor because, as you saw, we also had some weakness on the revenue growth, but that wasn\'t necessarily related to ACA, but just in general, I was trying to convey that there is some logical, I guess, explanation to some of what\'s happening in the sense that there appears to be a lot of optimism on the part of small businesses and we\'re seeing that reflected in parts of our business. In other parts of the business the results are mixed because we do, I think, see as a result of the fact that 50% of the PEO\'s business comes from referrals of our existing payroll sales force, to the extent that that sales force is encountering some slower decision-making, particularly in the midmarket, and also encountering some slow decision-making as a result of uncertainty about ACA that is expected to have and is having some impact on the PEO. But to be clear, the weakness in the revenue growth of the PEO was almost exclusively the pass-through revenues and lower inflation in health benefits and a slight slowing in benefits participation which is probably also related to a, quote unquote, peaking of ACA implementations. And by that I mean that we have seen several year decline in benefits participation rate, in other words how many eligible employees of the PEO actually take benefits and that sort of the trend upward as we got closer to the deadline. So the last, call it, two years right before ACA, given the fact that the law was intended to increase participation and companies were coming to the PEO in order to comply with the law, we saw those participation rates trend up. And now we saw the increase in the second quarter be a smaller increase than in the prior second quarter and in the quarters before that. So that slowing trend of benefits participation coupled with lower inflation of benefits per worksite employee is what led to slower growth, if you will, in the PEO, but the 12% worksite employee growth is still very, very strong, so we\'re still very happy with what we consider to be net revenue growth in the PEO which is now growing almost in line with worksite employees whereas historically had grown a little bit faster because of this pass-through cost pressure. So I hope that helps a little bit... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I just have one piece of information for you, Tim, is the average client size in the PEO is now around mid 40s, so it spans really the small business space as well as our midmarket up to a couple hundred employees per client, so it\'s affected by performance in down and midmarket in its growth. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. And then just following up on the comment about the mid to upper markets, I understand retention was a little better overall for you, so you retained existing customers, but do you have enough data to know that – I guess, it was slower decision-making or a lack of decision by clients versus competitive win losses on new opportunities that had an impact this quarter? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We monitor obviously our competitive position in the market space and I think we have seen performance competitively according to our expectations. One element that Carlos had not mentioned is, I think, our sales force has reported relatively strong pipelines overall throughout these months, so it was really not due to a lack of interest, but it was really what we felt a slowing of the decision-making process as we forecasted certainly, but also those things together, solid competitive position as well as good pipeline gave us basically the basis for the forecast that we just made. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And it\'s certainly isn\'t for lack of head count, so we\'re in a strong position from a sales force capability standpoint. And I think if your question was really around did our retention – I think, you started off by asking about retention, did retention benefit from slower decision, that\'s possible. So it is possible that on the other side of the coin, if you will, people didn\'t make as many decisions than we were able to hold on to clients, it\'d have very difficult for us to measure that, but it\'s possible. Tim J. McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, thanks for the color. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Berkley of Barclays. Your line is now open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my questions, just real quick here, you\'ve seen about 200 basis points margin expansion during the first two quarters of the year. Obviously, when it compares to your guidance, are up 50 basis points and implies a meaningful contraction in the second half. Could you just walk us through the drivers of that and the contribution to margins perhaps that are tied to ACA products in the quarter or anything else that you\'d like to call out? And then just kind of keeping with that theme, you\'ve talked about pass-through pressure being better than anticipated, helping to drive margin expansion there. And so just thinking about margins overall with PEO growing much faster than Employer Services which has got a meaningfully lower margin, how do we think about the sustainability of like 50 basis points a year over time? Like what\'s ultimately driving expansion against the PEO headwind? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. James, that is a fairly comprehensive margin question, I would say. So let me start, I think you are isolating some of the factors that create more margin pressure in the second half of our fiscal year. So number one is the easier compare that we had in the first half of the fiscal year due to our ACA related investments is clear. So in the beginning of 2016 fiscal year we had largely selling and implementation expense for ACA and then we started to receive revenues for these products in the third and fourth quarter of last fiscal year. And so the upcoming quarters don\'t have that easier compare and so the margin expansion that we experienced in the first two quarters is not going to repeat itself due to the growing into our more steady ACA revenue base. Secondly, we expect of course sales to grow as we indicated in our prepared remarks, and so that means of course also selling expense is anticipated to grow and in this case contribute to the margin pressure. And we\'re also continuing our investments into product and innovation, which is in this case at an equal basis contributing to the margin pressure. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think we also have – I think our expectation is a little bit of a return of the growth of the PEO pass-through cost, which I think that just mathematically also adds to – I think the last part of your question was a broad PEO margin pressure question about ADP, but in this first half, second half it is a factor. Based on our current forecast, just the expectation for our pass-through cost for the second half alone causes some pressure in the second half. And I think your broader question about overall pressure is a very, very good question which we spend a lot of time looking at and talking about. But this year in particular, because of lower benefits inflation costs, we actually, as you could tell from the first half of the year, it actually helped us. It took some of the pressure that we had historically had off. So even though the PEO has an absolute lower margin, the fact that its margin has been improving as much as it has combined with the slower growth of pass-through costs made this a moot point for the first two quarters of this year. And I think what you have from us is a commitment to really make sure that we have a lot of transparency around because we do a lot of what-if scenarios around the next two to three years what the PEO margin expectation is versus the ES margin expectation and the overall ADP. And we feel comfortable at least right now that we are in a place where we\'re able to still achieve the guidance that we\'ve provided on a long-term basis, but over time that could change. If we have a lot of inflation and pass-through costs, we might have to revisit that topic just because of the pure mathematics, not because of the quality of the business or the strength of the business, just because of the math that I think you\'re implying. But I think for now, I think we\'re in an okay position. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks a lot, that\'s really helpful. I know I threw a lot at you there. Just real quick, a much shorter question, just what\'s driving the unchanged EPS guide? That was obviously nice to see. You raised it last quarter, and you were able to keep it steady here despite declining top line. Is it just tax rate and a step up in buybacks versus prior expectations or maybe some conservatism on your end in the past, or something else that maybe I\'m missing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. No, I think that – Jan may have something to add, but we had a great quarter earnings-wise, so that helps because we obviously provide guidance based on what we really think is going to happen. And as I think we were clear in our comments, the second quarter exceeded our expectation. So in fairness, we got a little bit of tailwind from the second quarter going into "maintaining" our guidance for the year on earnings. So I think we feel good about where we are in terms of our expenses, even though Jan described very well this issue of we\'ve lapped our ACA revenues, and we had already lapped our ACA expenses for the last two quarters. So those kind of factors are what helped boost the margins in the first two quarters of the fiscal year which we don\'t get in the second two quarters of the fiscal year. But in general when we look at the quality and the trajectory of the business, we feel pretty good other than this issue in new business bookings, which ironically helps our margin in the first half of the fiscal year. Other than that factor, we feel pretty good about where we are. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks a lot. I appreciate your time. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC. Your line is now open. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. Good morning. Let me follow that up with one more question about margins. Can you give us a sense, how much of the margin improvement this quarter was the operating efficiencies versus the lower sales commissions? I noticed you said them in that order. So was that done by design based on the impact? And then what were the costs in the quarter and the first half I guess for the service alignment changes? And is it still that the vast majority of that cost has not happened yet happens in the back half? Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Let me start about the Service Alignment Initiative. The Service Alignment Initiative causes us in the fiscal year to take a restructuring charge of approximately $100 million throughout, and we took the first 40-some million dollars in the first quarter and just very little in the second quarter. In addition to those restructuring costs, we incur about a 20 bps margin pressure through dual operations, which is not part of the non-GAAP measure. And that is incurring throughout the fiscal year, so there\'s not a great variation in this throughout. The second question to you, about 0.5%, a little less than 0.5% of the margin improvement in the first half is due to our lower MDE – our lower selling expense – selling and marketing expense in the first half, and then about 120 basis points was operating efficiencies of scale. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. And then just a quick follow-up, on the bookings, is there any way to have any confidence that this is really short-term driven related to uncertainty around the election rather than the changes that come out of the new administration dampening demand for the product? So the overtime rules, ACA you\'ve already been clear on. I think we understand that. But do you get that kind of color from clients, or is it more you think just no one wanted to step up because there was and probably still is so much uncertainty? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. While we have noodled this question now a number of ways, I tried to add a few elements to it. If the changes in economic policy lead to sustained economic growth, that is the most important driver for our success of new business bookings. So if the belief that is currently I guess reflected in bullish equity markets and other things, business confidence comes true, I think that will be naturally a good thing because we are positively correlated to good economic environment, and good employment helps ADP. So the fundamental – that\'s the most important driver for our new business bookings growth is a healthy economic environment. Now economic – changes in the regulatory environment contribute maybe to economic growth and they also contribute to change in regulatory requirements in the HR space, which help ADP. I would guess that change will happen over time and the number of changes that are coming down to our clients is high, so I don\'t think there\'s a principal change in need for compliance solutions in the HR space to be foreseen in any near-term future. So net-net, I think, if the economic positive outcome materializes, I think that will be good news for ADP overall and we remain confident in our ability to sell. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Jan, I think to add to that, I think we have some historical data to support Jan\'s points like, obviously, we don\'t have any historical data to really be able to ascertain what\'s happening, what month and with what regulation. But the first point about the economy is indisputable that when ADP is obviously a very – from a recurring revenue model standpoint on our revenues and our profitability and so forth a relatively defensive steady company, but new business bookings is a little bit different. And when you look at 20 years of data, our new business bookings growth over the course of rolling four quarters because obviously any one quarter can have issues like we just experienced. We can have a new regulation that requires a new product. We had for example Y2K 20 years ago but, in general, follows very, very closely almost a smooth line what\'s happening with the economy, as does our pays per control growth. So our pays per control growth when unemployment is going up, tends to go down and vice versa. So we are in new business bookings, I think, somewhat tied to the strength of the economy and so, as Jan said – and we are, obviously, we try to be as transparent as possible. We were sitting here talking about potentially entering a recession. We would have to, I think, temper our optimism based on that 20 years of history. But since that doesn\'t appear to be the environment that we\'re entering at least for now, we feel that we\'re going to rely on this historical data and I think plan on returning to historical growth rates in our new business, and our new business bookings. In terms of this issue of the specific regulations and change and so forth, there\'s also a lot of history in ADP. There\'s more than 20 years of history where even though there are bumps along the road in terms of the amount of regulation and the type of regulation, in general the trajectory has been in one direction. And that\'s a global statement, not just a U.S. statement because governments try to effect public policy through employment and through employers, whether it\'s around safety, or taxes, or a variety of healthcare in this case. And so we like where we are, we like the space we operate in, and we\'re optimistic about, I think, the future, although obviously, we\'re not exactly happy about what\'s happening in the short term here. Gary Bisbee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great, thank you. I appreciate all color. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about the timeline and monetization model for the rollout of your reporting and benchmarking modules? Exactly where they are in terms of rolling out and just directionally what the magnitude is that you expect coming in from those modules in terms of new business bookings and revenues over time? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Lisa, yeah, our big data and analytics capabilities we view as one of our strategic differentiators in our product set. And we\'re planning actually to capture the benefit of this capability that is quite unique in a variety of methods. And the most fundamental is that we\'re going to be incorporating many of those analytics, benchmarking and predictive analytics, into our core product and differentiate the core bundle with a better solution. So for example, data and DataCloud is an integral part of our Vantage offering and is available to all Vantage clients, and is part of what makes Vantage a differentiated product. In the mid-market we\'re selling it as an incremental module for now, and clients buy it on a recurring revenue basis. We have a few thousand clients having bought the product in the last 12 months or so. So we\'re kind of in the very early stages of rolling out these capabilities to it. I encourage everybody to think about the data analytics capability as a broad differentiator that will not only affect our core product for our clients, will improve our service and implementation capabilities, and will be – we\'re kind of right now in the very beginning stages of seeing those benefits coming through. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And I think – I\'ll just add that I think we are working on these types of products and others in order to drive not just incremental revenue from the products themselves, but to gain market share and to win more new business. Because the reality is that when we wake up every morning we\'re thinking about how you grow over $1.75 billion in new business bookings. And to give you a specific answer like in the next year or two we don\'t plan on sharing on this call that it had the same impact as ACA. Because again, the numbers are just so large that unless we simultaneously generate incremental revenues from new products, while driving – using those new products to drive better differentiation and more net new wins in the marketplace to gain market share, then we\'re not going to be able to grow the business. I think Jan described it well which is it\'s a very broad strategy around differentiation and strengthening our products, as well as we don\'t mind earning a little bit of extra revenue and income from selling those types of products. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thanks, and then just quickly for my follow-up, can you give the 20 second update on the Workforce Now migrations and whether you\'re still on track to finish them by the end of the year? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yes, we\'re still on track. We feel pretty good. I think, Jan, may have the... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We\'re steered away from the digital numbers here, but we\'re committed to substantially complete the migrations in our-market space by the end of the fiscal year. And I think we\'re going to have a few stragglers into the first quarter, but substantially we are on plan with those migrations. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And very excited about it. Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Good morning. Just, I guess, on the bookings front, have you changed your assumption on bookings specific to selling additional ACA modules? I think in the past, you\'ve said that you\'ve sold about half your ACA base already there. Does this shift to flat bookings cover that? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yes, it does. So one big chunk, of course, is the adjustment to our selling expense expectations that we had for that product. As you might imagine that is significantly down and our new guidance incorporates that thinking. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Thanks, Jan. And then on the – just the acquisition of the Marcus research – Buckingham, is it more of a people-based, so I get the technology side of it. But it seems like they do some consulting and perhaps some people-based services as well at this Marcus Buckingham Company. I\'m just curious if you can give a little more on the addition there? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So we like it so much because there\'s a service component in addition to a technology component which actually fits well with our business model, so you\'re right. There is a – they have deep, deep data analytics and insights in their own business, and so there\'s a lot of research-based, data-driven decision-making in how they deliver their products. I think the belief by them and by us is that we have obviously a very big data set to be able to enhance the work that they do to really help people create a better workforce. And so I think the combination of the coaching, the data and the analytics along with combining that with ADP, I think, we think that we could really do something special here. So again, caution that given the $12 billion of revenue, if it wasn\'t obvious from our comments, this is not an immediate game changer from a revenue growth standpoint, but it\'s an immediate game changer from a strategic standpoint and from a brand standpoint. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Right. Yeah, no. It seems powerful to put on top of your platform. Thank you. Go ahead. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel. Your line is now open. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Thank you. So just to put the bookings provision in context, it seems that everything else being equal the impact is less than $100 million of annualized revenue given the booking space. Are we thinking about that right? And I know it\'s still early, but is there anything else we should think about in the context of next year\'s revenue growth trajectory other than obviously the easier comparison? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. No. I think that that\'s as good a math as – for example, when we had some challenges with retention in the last year, that\'s kind of the way to look at things is to use simple math to put things in perspective. And so we obviously fully expect to return to stronger new business bookings growth as these compares get a little bit easier and hopefully as some of this uncertainty wears off, but I think that your math is dead on, which is why you hear us still remaining optimistic. We would obviously prefer to have $100 million then to not have the $100 million, but I think in the context of what we\'re trying to accomplish for the company from a value generation standpoint, EPS, share buybacks, et cetera, it really doesn\'t – for now, it doesn\'t have a major impact. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And, David, while that quantitative estimate is that kind of scopes it, but obviously, key assumptions for revenue growth also are impacted by your belief in retention as well as we pointed out in this point of time of year, in particular around the pass-through revenue growth of the POE, those would be the two other factors that I think could have meaningful or somehow an impact on your revenue growth expectations for the longer term. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Right. And then just secondly, and I may have missed this, you may have mentioned this, but I was just looking, pays per control were roughly in line with trends, so just trying to understand the context of where the weakness was, if you can call this out? But was it primarily in unit growth? Or was it revenue per client? Or is it just kind of both without any real noticeable trend? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. You\'re referring to new business bookings? Or... David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Yes. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I\'m not sure I understand, sorry, the question. The... Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think we indicated that we had new business bookings weakness in the mid and up market. That was stronger impacted by the slowing of the buying decisions. And if you refer – I think, I can tell you that our client growth continues to be very solid, mostly driven by our success in the down market, so really very nice performance in the small business market with unit growth. So mathematically, I guess, what it boils down is a mix of all of that together. David Grossman - Stifel Financial Corp. Okay. So just then looking at the mid and up market then, Jan, was there any real distinction between unit growth and revenue per client in terms of the shortfall? Or was it just a combination of both? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. No. Not really. Not a change. I think both fell a little bit short. Clearly, it\'s always clouded right now by this difficult compare about the ACA, and we have emphasized this in a number of calls. The ACA modules themselves are easy to identify, but ACA has triggered a lot of buying decisions for broader product bundles. And it\'s hard to analytically differentiate between what was the true ACA impact and what was just enhanced buying cycles because this triggered a buying event in what was just regular course of business. So we\'re a little bit hesitant to say that. But overall, in the mid and upmarket, I think we have seen continuation of trends and new logo growth as we call it and upselling. It\'s just at a lower level. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Jan, I think that – sorry. Maybe I didn\'t at first understand the question, but I did look last night at sales force productivity over the last few years. And as you can imagine, now our average productivity per sales rep is down, but largely driven by ACA. If you exclude ACA, our sales productivity is still in line with our expectations. So I think what we\'ve had is we had – and I think we\'ve been every quarter I think very, very clear. We haven\'t been pretending that it was either sustainable or that we had done something magical to all of a sudden create such a huge increase in productivity in our sales force. I wish we had. Clearly, we got help from and lift from ACA sales. We had two years of 13% and 12% new business bookings growth, fiscal years, and I don\'t know the last time that we had ever done that. So clearly, maybe we didn\'t emphasize enough how much help we were getting. And certainly now it\'s difficult to go back to the sales force and remind them that we had help and now the help isn\'t there anymore. We\'ve got to now focus on fundamentals. We\'ve got to go back to selling new clients and the old-fashioned approach of ADP of having a reasonable mix of head count growth and productivity growth. And I think when I look through the numbers and try to normalize for ACA, we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of head count and also sales force productivity. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Ridley-Lane, Bank of America. Your line is now open. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Sure, good morning. Over the last few years, ADP has leaned pretty heavily on regulatory and compliance offerings. As the U.S. labor market looks to tighten and perhaps wage inflation picks up, what are some of the more growth-oriented offerings that you have for clients? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s actually a fantastic question because this afternoon I\'m actually going to speak to our midmarket sales force about some of the things that we can and need to do in terms of getting ourselves reset here for a different environment. I think, as we said multiple times today, we\'re not going to a zero regulation environment. So 99% of the laws and regulations that affect employers are still in place today that were in place two months ago, and they\'re probably going to be in place a year and five years from now, and there may be new ones. And so we have always been there to help our clients with compliance and with regulation. Having said that, we\'re clearly entering a period of time with tightening labor markets where I think many employers\' attention is going to turn to how to attract and retain a workforce. And this is something that we\'ve been building to over the last four to five, six, seven years by investing in our talent management suites. by investing in tools to help our clients use data and analytics to run their business better and manage a better workforce. So we\'ve been preparing fortunately for this strategic opportunity here for many years, and it\'s coming and it\'s coming fast because I believe we reported the ADP Employment Report this morning, and that\'s only going to add to I think the tighter labor markets. Because as we\'ve seen multiple times in the last 20 to 30 years, as unemployment gets to the level that it\'s at now and we understand that there might still be a little bit of slack as a result of labor force participation, but that slack will also inevitably come out of the system, whether it\'s in 6 months or in 12 months. It may have already come out, we don\'t know. But besides higher interest rates, which are going to be beneficial to ADP, we think this is going to be beneficial to ADP\'s new business bookings and to our approach to the market, which is to help our clients and products exactly with this topic. How do you attract and retain the best workforce when everyone else is trying to do the same thing? So we\'re not ready to say there\'s a war for talent yet, but clearly there are pockets of that. And I think when that happens, I think some of the products and solutions that we\'ve developed, this acquisition that we\'ve just done with TMBC, I think, position us well to help our clients with that. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. And then I know that the revenue contribution from the acquisition is pretty small, but bigger picture you\'ve been focused mainly on organic development over the last few years. Should we read this acquisition as potentially suggesting you\'re open to a bit more tuck-in acquisitions going forward? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think we always have maintained a position that we view our balance sheet and our capital strength as one of our assets, and we have been evaluating and looking at acquisitions all along. And so you should anticipate that we\'ll keep an open mind around those going forward, and they will need now a joint evaluation of augmenting us strategically, like the talent management acquisition of Marcus Buckingham fits right into this talent search, manage your workforce better, so strategically fitting well, but also not adding in a disproportionate way to the complexity of our operations as we have focused so much to simplify our varying environment. And we\'re going to, as a management team, evaluate those acquisitions to maximize the value really eventually for the shareholder over time. David E. Ridley-Lane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one more question. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi. This is Ashish Sabadra calling on behalf of Bryan Keane. Just to follow up on questions regarding the ACA, the new administration is pretty keen on repealing the ACA, and I was wondering. Is there a way to quantify what percentage of ADP\'s existing revenue may be directly or indirectly linked to ACA, like the ACA module or other revenues which may be linked to ACA and could be potentially impacted by the repeal? Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We have reported that last year we filed for approximately 10 million employees 1095 forms, so that gives you a rough revenue estimate, between $150 million and $200 million of ACA revenue in our business. But it is with very – we have to be very thoughtful about what will happen to them. Clearly, it could go away, but it could also maintain new solutions, certain reporting requirements which are at the core of the value proposition of the ACA. So we at this point are really not in a position to estimate what part of this revenue is at risk or if there could be even further growth in that ACA revenue, but it gives you a rough estimate about the size of our directly ACA-related revenues, about $150 million to $200 million. Ashish Sabadra - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the color. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So as we mentioned, obviously some of the uncertainties that have been created as a result of this change in administration and the talk about repeal and replace of ACA are certainly not helping us in terms of our new business bookings here in the second quarter, but we still are pretty positive about our business model. I think you\'ve heard that from us today that we\'re well positioned for helping our clients with what are becoming very, very tight labor markets, and we\'re also optimistic that there will be some change. We know there\'s going to be change, so repeal is clearly in the eye of the beholder, but given that there\'s a commitment to maintaining 20 million Americans on insurance we believe there will be some new form of tracking of regulation and that we will have something that we can help our clients with if not the current ACA products that we have today. In the meantime, we\'re going to rely on our historical track record of being able to navigate through obviously these uncertain times and wait for the inevitable pickup in the economic activity as well as government activity around some of these changes. We continue to invest in simplifying our portfolio, as Jan said, including using that as one of the criteria for acquisitions. You\'ve heard us talk about how we\'re aligning our service model. We\'re very excited about what that\'s going to do for the quality and long term cost of our service, and as you heard from us today, we\'re certainly not backing down on our distribution channel. So we continue to invest in our sales force and grow our sales force because we plan on continuing to grow. So we appreciate your time today. Thank you for joining us, and we appreciate your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I\'d like to welcome everyone to ADP\'s Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\'s Vice President, Investor Relations. I\'m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\'s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I\'d like to remind everyone that today\'s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. Today, we released our third quarter fiscal 2017 results, with reported revenue growth of 5% to $3.4 billion. This revenue growth includes about 1 percentage point of pressure from the second quarter disposition of our spending accounts in COBRA businesses. Our diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our performance in more detail shortly. Our new business bookings this quarter declined by 7%, as we continued to overcome the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. I\'d like to remind you that the Affordable Care Act factor was quite unique and that it helped accelerate various buying decisions across our mid- and upmarkets, both from new client share and our existing base. Nevertheless, our pipeline of HCM opportunities continues to be strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now. Now, let me discuss client retention. As we reported, retention declined 170 basis points for the quarter. The losses that contributed to this decline were concentrated on our legacy platforms, and we believe some of these losses were triggered by our upgrade activities in the mid- and upmarket. We maintain our core belief that these migrations are the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP. Our midmarket migrations are anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year, while the migration efforts upmarket will be phased in over time in partnership with our clients. Client satisfaction and retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are seeing that with our midmarket Workforce Now platform. The feedback from clients on this platform has been positive. In fact, a report from G2 Crowd, a leading business solutions review platform, recently added ADP Workforce Now to its Best Software 2017 list in the Core HR category. This list is based exclusively on feedback from users of the product. We ranked highest for ease-of-use, quality of support, which is especially gratifying given our focus on service and the user experience. ADP\'s success over the past 68 years is tied to our ability to keep pace with our clients\' evolving needs across economic cycles. As our recent workforce vitality report indicated, the labor market continues to be robust, and we see our clients becoming increasingly focused on talent, finding, retaining and engaging critical staff in a much more competitive environment. Our recent acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company, which we completed in the third quarter, is an example of our commitment to assist clients in meeting their talent needs. When it comes to talent and performance management, we know the needs of each client and each team are unique. By adding TMBC\'s content, coaching and technology solutions to the ADP portfolio, we now offer a suite of proven products to help leaders unleash the talent of their teams and create value for our clients. We\'ve talked before about our focus on the user experience and delivering solutions that our clients and their employees find easier and more intuitive to use. We\'ve applied that same thinking to our channel partners with the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect. We\'re particularly proud of the continued strength and robust growth of our downmarket, where we now have over 500,000 clients on our RUN platform. And this unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll as well as reporting and tax information for all our shared clients. This solution was developed in collaboration with our accountant channel partners to meet their needs and has already been recognized by Accountant Today (sic) [Accounting Today] (5:41) as one its 2017 top new products in the accountant resources category. We believe solutions like ADP Accountant Connect will help further enhance our relationships with this important referral channel while creating a better experience for our shared clients. We are also pleased to recently receive recognition from NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, who identified ADP as a leader in payroll services for the fourth consecutive year. In naming us a leader, the NelsonHall report highlighted our global reach and the breadth of our service offering, allowing clients ranging from small businesses to global enterprises to choose how much expertise they wish to retain in-house or to outsource. In its report, NelsonHall also recognized ADP\'s ability to help clients benchmark their workforce metrics against industry averages using the ADP data cloud. And they also recognize the ADP Marketplace, which helps clients access an ecosystem of enterprise applications from ADP and our partners to extend the value of their HCM solutions. It\'s great to be recognized in the industry, but it\'s also great when we see our company recognized more broadly, which is why I was especially proud to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies\' list for the 11th time and rank us number one in our category for the fifth straight time. I\'m particularly proud of this because it\'s a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our 57,000 associates. In closing, despite the pressure on new business bookings and retention, we remain confident in the enduring qualities of our business. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO and multinational solutions and with our improving service metrics within the midmarket. We are especially pleased with our success in the downmarket, which continues to demonstrate the value of our strategy to deliver great technology and great service. We are confident that this strategy is the right one to help our clients succeed, which will in turn drive sustained growth for ADP. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results and an update on the fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic. Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points, compared to 24.8% in last year\'s third quarter. Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative. Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate this quarter was aided by an incremental tax benefit related to prior period software development efforts, $0.04 of which was not previously anticipated and $0.02 tax benefit related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our new business bookings performance this quarter was disappointing. However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth. We\'re confident in the competitiveness of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution capabilities, and in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. As a result of improving employment, we have continued to see pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections impact client fund balances. This pressure was offset by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control metric. Employer Services margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative. PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter. The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. New business bookings this quarter were down 7%. And as a result, we now expect new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We have also updated certain other elements of our fiscal 2017 forecast, which I will now take you through. Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter\'s revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. This forecast continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our service alignment initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, we continue to anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis. Accordingly, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion of at least 100 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $15 million compared to the prior forecast of about $10 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a result of the software development related tax benefit, some of which was not previously contemplated in our prior guidance and the additional benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be 31.4% as compared to our prior forecasted rate of 32.4%. Based upon our revision of our effective tax rate guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14% compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. Our forecast also continues to contemplate a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1. 4 billion, subject to market conditions during fiscal year 2017. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. So, with that, I will turn the call back to our operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

I’d like to now introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain Alright, great. Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining ADI's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules, and the investor toolkit at their usual spot, at investor.analog.com. And specifically about the investor toolkit, it's something we post on our website two hours before the earnings call and it's actually a pretty good summary of our prepared remarks. So, for those that are interested in kind of getting the early scoop, that's probably good place to go, as we file our press release. With me on today's call are ADI’s CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI’s CFO, Dave Zinsner. Before we start, let’s do our disclosures. Please note the information we’re about to discuss, including objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-K. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our comments today will also include non-GAAP financial measures, which we've reconciled to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in today’s earnings release, which we’ve posted at investor.analog.com. And so with all that behind us, let's get started. And I'd like to turn the call over to Vincent Roche, our CEO. Vincent Roche Thank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. By almost any measure, ADI had an excellent fourth quarter. To put it in perspective, we achieved record revenue of $1 billion, expanded operating margins to a record 38% of sales and we generated record free cash flow margins of 44%. Throughout fiscal 2016, as you know, caution and uncertainty were the norm across the world. Nevertheless, we executed well in a tough business environment, investing and positioning ourselves for future growth while remaining disciplined and making smart investment tradeoffs. All told, the actions we took during the year drove free cash flow margins to 33.7%, a 520 basis-point improvement over the prior year. And I’m very proud of the stellar execution by our entire team. For ADI, it starts with an obsession for customers’ success as I personally spend, as you know, a lot of time talking to and listening to their needs. It’s obvious to me from these conversations that ADI is an exceptional Company and we're more relevant to our customers than ever before. What is also clear is that our customers are seeking true innovation partners, as they grow and develop their businesses in the midst of unprecedented levels of complexity. At the same time, our customers’ hardware engineering talent is stretched thin. As a result, they're increasingly focusing their design efforts on systems and software while turning the analog design challenge to ADI where we have economies of scale and of scope. With the analog design challenges set to become even more complicated and critical in the area of IoT and Industry 4.0 for example, helping our customers bridge the physical and digital domains in mission critical applications will, we believe, create tremendous opportunities for sustainable profitable growth for ADI long into the future. Customers choose us because we've been at this craft for over 50 years now. And in our industry, brand matters. The ADI brand is synonymous with high quality and high performance. And our customers rightly have full faith that ADI will support them today and well into the future. We've demonstrated an unwavering commitment to innovation that creates economic value for our customers by investing strongly in our own business. Since the great recession, ADI has invested $4 billion in research and development alone, primarily in the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure. We've also made investments in quality, manufacturing, supply chain and field operations because being able to effectively and efficiently deliver high reliability innovation and customer support is just as important as the innovation itself. In addition to these organic investments, we've been acquiring capability that not only builds our technology base but also enables ADI to move up the value stack. During the year, we announced the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology which once complete will create a high performance analog leader with the combined company having a top-two market share position across all the key building blocks of the analog market, namely data convertors; power management; amplifiers; interface; and high performance RF and microwave. Once the transaction closes, we will have the ability to meet all of our customers’ analog and mixed signal needs in sticky, long life cycle, high value applications in the industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets. During the year, we also acquired some very interesting early stage technologies which we believe will help ADI move up the value stack, as we say over time. The acquisition of SNAP Sensor gives ADI the ability to provide our customers with very high dynamic range imaging capabilities, important in smart city applications, as an example. For smart factory applications, we acquired Innovasic, a developer of the Deterministic Ethernet Switching and Software Solutions to extend our reach in this core market. We also acquired the Cyber Security Solutions of Sypris, giving ADI the ability to provide customers with a trusted sensor to cloud solution with security write down of the node. And just recently, we announced the acquisition of some exciting LIDAR technology from Vescent Photonics that will enable ADI to develop a true solid state scanning LIDAR system complementing our existing RADAR-based ADAS offerings. And these things are very important in autonomous driving applications. The investments we’ve made and continue to make are helping create economic value for our customers. And I’d like to share a few examples of where ADI’s technology is making a real difference. In the automotive space, our recently announced A2B Audio Bus structure provides vehicle manufacturers with high-end in-cabin audio fidelity while reducing vehicle weight. We estimate that our solution helps save car manufacturers approximately $30 per vehicle in combined CO2 taxes and fuel efficiency. In the area of factory and process automation, our software configurable input output solutions are solving significant channel density, physical space and thermal challenges while reducing system complexity and installation and wiring costs. And in the healthcare arena, ADI’s vital signs monitoring products are bringing clinical grade care into the home, enabling high-quality remote patient monitoring that reduces or even eliminates the need for and cost of the hospital stay. Ours is a customer value creation journey, 51 years in the making. We have the intellectual capital and more importantly, we have a talented, passionate and engaged team of ADI to help serve our customers needs today and well into the future. The combination with Linear Technology represents the next phase in this value creation journey. With our market-leading product portfolios tied to attractive markets, we believe we can create a free cash flow engine that will be unmatched in our industry and help provide investors with an attractive combination of growth and shareholder value from many years to come. So with that, I’d like to turn the call over to Ali for details on our performance by end market in the fourth quarter. Ali Husain Great, thanks Vince. So digging deeper into our results by end market. The industrial market of 39% of revenue increased 6% sequentially; a very strong result in what is typically a weaker period for the industrial business. Revenue from our broad base of small and medium sized customers was better than seasonal and in fact increased sequentially. And the expected rebound in the aerospace and defense sector was also pretty strong. And our healthcare business also posted record quarter as we are now beginning to see the early returns from our investments in the healthcare sector. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market showed actually pretty considerable strength, growing 8% over the prior year, and it was broad based strength across all of the industrial sectors, as we compare the year-on-year performance. The automotive market at 14% of revenue increased 5% sequentially and that was broad based growth across really all sectors within this market. But I’d say, more importantly, automotive revenues increased 7% compared to the prior year. Communications infrastructure sales at 17% of revenue decreased slightly from the prior quarter. Both, wireless and wireline application revenues decreased slightly sequentially but increased compared to the prior year, led by growth in a 100 gig plus optical networking applications. The consumer market at 29% of fourth quarter revenue increased 58% sequentially, and decreased 7% compared to the prior year with both sequential and year-over-year results, largely due to portable consumer application sales. So, now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2016. With the exception of revenue, Dave’s comments on fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 P&L line items will exclude special items, which in the aggregate totaled $39 million for the quarter. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures and our calculation of free cash flow are on schedules E and F in today’s release. So with that, Dave, it's all yours. Dave Zinsner Thanks, Ali. The fourth quarter was once again a very strong and profitable quarter, and we set records for revenue, operating margin, free cash flow generation and earnings per share. Revenue in the fourth quarter totaled $1 billion and diluted earnings per share was $1.05. Gross margins of 66.6% increased 60 basis points from the prior quarter and included a 120 basis-point benefit relating to the sale of previously reserved portable consumer application inventory. Excluding this item, gross margins were in line with guidance, decreasing 60 basis points from the prior quarter, due to mix. We continue to tightly manage inventories and as a result, inventory on a dollars basis in the fourth quarter decreased $16 million sequentially and inventory on the days basis decreased 17 days to a 105 days. Weeks of inventory and distribution were slightly below seven weeks and we're at the leanest level in six years. Operating expenses increased 3% sequentially, lagging well behind the 15% sequential increase in revenue. As a result, operating profit hit a record 38.1% of revenue expanding 400 basis points sequentially and 220 basis points over the prior year. Other expense in the fourth quarter was approximately $20 million. Our tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 10%, as we adjusted our full year tax rate to approximately 11%. Excluding special items, our business delivered strong operating leverage, even with low utilization rates. And diluted earnings per share grew 28% sequentially to the $1.05 per share, which was almost twice the rate of sequential revenue growth. We had a record cash generation quarter with free cash flow margins of 44%, expanding 600 basis points compared to the year ago period. Capital additions during the quarter were $41 million and we expect fiscal 2017 capital additions to be in the range of $125 million to $145 million. During the quarter, we paid a $130 in dividends and our long-term financial model incorporates annual dividend increases of 5% to 10%. At the current stock price, ADI's dividend yield of a $1.68 represents a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%, although maybe a little bit lower now that the stock rose today. Now, I'll take a moment to talk about our performance in 2016. Revenue of $3.4 billion was stable to the prior year and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share decreased 3% from the prior year, primarily due to lower gross margins and higher interest expense ahead of the Linear Tech deal close. The lower gross margins for the year were primarily the result of a very deliberate and disciplined inventory management program that reduced inventory on a dollars basis by $36 million or 9% and on a days’ basis reduced inventory in the fourth quarter by nine days to a 105 days. Nevertheless, gross margins remained relatively stable to the prior year as we minimized the impact of lower factory utilization rates through pricing and cost efficiencies. The good news is that inventory levels are now in excellent shape. All told, fiscal 2016 free cash flow margins expanded by over 500 basis points to 34%, setting a new Company record. During the year, we also returned almost $900 million or 77% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks. Of course, the biggest news of the year was the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology. To-date, we’ve received regulatory clearances in Israel, Germany, Japan and United States. And we now expect the transaction to close by the end of our second fiscal quarter of 2017. Our integration planning teams are hard at work and we are very pleased with their progress. Vincent put me in charge of the integration effort, and I am confident that our combined Company will be greater than some of its parts. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow, and for accretion levels to increase as we have begin realizing the planned $150 million of annualized run rate synergies within 18 months of the transaction close. During the quarter, we also made good progress on financing the transaction, locking up a $5 billion term loan facility. Based on our current expectations, we anticipate the all-in coupon rate related to the financing to be approximately 3%. So, now, turning to our outlook and expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, which with the exception of revenue expectations is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes known special items that are outlined in today's release. Order rates are currently stable across our business as we enter the seasonally slow January quarter. As a result, we expect revenue in the first quarter to decrease sequentially and be in the range of $840 million to $900 million, but to grow 9% to 17% over the prior year. With inventory levels and utilization rates in good shape, we anticipate gross margins in the first quarter to be between 65.5% and 66%. We expect operating expenses in the first quarter to increase slightly sequentially and for operating profit before tax to be well north of 30%. We are planning for our tax rate to be approximately 11%, which is our planned non-GAAP rate until we close the Linear transaction. In total, excluding special items, we expect diluted earnings per share in the first quarter to be between $0.68 to $0.78, which would represent year-over-year earnings per share growth of 21% to 39%. This was a great quarter for the Company, and we are very proud of our achievements. But as Vince always says, we should be often pleased but never satisfied. It is our job to make sure that we continue to exceed expectations. Our customers, employees and shareholders would expect nothing less and neither do we. So with that, operator, let’s open up the floor for questions. Ali Husain Just a reminder to folks on the line, please limit yourself to one question. If you have a follow-up, I would ask that you please re-queue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness that everybody who wants to ask a question gets to ask at least one of their questions. And we’re running this call till 11. So, I think that’s plenty of time to get to everyone's question. So, Jennifer, I think you have got the instructions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you. I know the rule but I had a quick fact check for Dave and then I had a longer term for Vince. Dave, I apologize if I am missing it, usually in your prepared press release, you do get the end-market breakdown for the coming quarter. I don’t think I saw at this time. Dave Zinsner Yes. Maybe we ordinarily do. Okay, I’ll give you two questions, Ambrish. I would say just kind of directionally the B2B businesses which we would consider industrial, automotive and communications will roughly be down mid-single digits. And of course consumer, I think would be roughly in the 30% down range. Does that answer your question, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava Yes, thank you. My other one was a bit of a longer term for you, Vince. And this is going back to a conversation you and I had a while ago. I know you’ve been on a path to transforming ADI and you’ve talked about inorganic as well as organic, and thinking more of a value creation as opposed to what we are used to, design-in, design-out. You kind of showed it in the consumer side so far that you are not a one socket win. But, give us a perspective of where we are. I know baseball season is over and I love cricket but cricket is bad analogy, there is only two innings. So, where are we in the transformation, Vince? And just help us with that perspective. Thank you.  Vincent Roche Yes, thanks Ambrish. Good questions. So, look, we are on a journey. We believe -- we said several years ago, we believe that there is enough impetus in our business and that we have the balance sheet as well to help us get this Company towards $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in a reasonable period of time. We are well on track. I believe over the next several years, we will be updating -- obviously when we integrate LTC, we will be updating all the benchmarks around what we expect our revenue to be over time, profits, free cash flow and so and so forth. So, I don’t know, I am not a cricket fan at all, Ambrish. I don’t know cricket. And I am only an amateur in terms of understanding baseball. But, I would say, we are still in the probably the first quarter of the transformation. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. That’s football. Vincent Roche So, we have plenty of upsides. As I said, what makes me very optimistic about this business is that the analog domain essentially sets the performance for all the systems that make up this massive information communications technology sector. It’s one of the foundational technologies. Our customers are asking us for more, more and more. And we are getting to the point now where we can be very, very choosey about the problems that we solve. And we can solve those problems across the board from microwave to mix signal to digital single processing, to power sensor technologies. So, I think there is a huge innovation upside that’s the root of this Company. We are in a better and better position with our customers. So, I am very optimistic that we can get this business well-beyond $5 billion in a reasonable period of time. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving, guys. Vincent Roche Many happy returns. Ali Husain Thanks, Ambrish. Next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Great execution, guys. Dave, can you remind us where utilization is right now? And what are your plans for the next quarter? Obviously you’ve done a great job bringing the inventory day down, but kind of as we look forward from here on, how should we think about utilization in inventories? Dave Zinsner So, utilization was in the kind of high 60s in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to be roughly in that range in the first quarter, which is somewhat atypical for us for our first quarter because generally we're working our inventory back down in the first quarter and with industrial usually having a sequential decline in the first quarter as well, it generally drives our utilization down a bit. But given that we've done so well, the operations group has done so well in terms of managing inventory this year, we can keep utilization a little bit higher going into the first quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Related question on the gross margin guidance, when we adjust for the sale of previously reserved product, you have a sequential trend in gross margin guidance that's better than seasonal. And you just mentioned the utilization rate being better than what you'd see typically in fiscal quarter. Is there anything else in terms of mix that also has an impact on the gross margin, maybe some weakness in base station or anything else that you could give us color on? Dave Zinsner I think it's generally utilization that's going to drive it. Because in reality, mix on a year-over-year basis is actually a little bit worse. Because if you remember the first quarter was a pretty difficult quarter for us with regard to consumer came down quite a bit. This year, it won't have as dramatic a decline. And so, mix is a little bit negative but utilization will offset. And I'd say the other thing just anecdotally as the operations group has done a very good job on the spending side, just really managing the expenses there. And so we've incrementally, I'd say, every year have been doing a bit better in terms of spending. And then on top of that there's obviously, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been focused on pricing as well. And so, I think those things have just had an incrementally little bit of a benefit every quarter. And then, of course utilization drives a lot of it and the offset would be mix. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach On industrial and understanding there is a big macro overlay to industrial but nice to see the broad based strength. Can you talk about, Vince, just maybe some of the applications or products that you're excited about in terms of where you're seeing some investment by your industrial customers? Vincent Roche Yes. I mentioned in the prepared remarks there, Craig, for example, in our core businesses, like robotics for example, there's a need to be able to push the speed and the accuracy of these robots to ever higher levels. That's a tremendous digital signal processing challenge. And we've been building complete solutions that are only coming to fruition now for that area to enable much higher speeds in the operation of the robots with lower power, much greater accuracy. So, it's a complete signal chain of digital signal processing technology and mix signal technology. I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well some of these software defined input-output structures that are enabling our customers to deepen the penetration of sensors into their environments and to dramatically reduce the complexity of installation and the costs. Energy is another area. It’s a slow burn market but it’s an area where we have tremendous technology in transmission and distribution and also in the metering of energy. So, those are just a couple of areas. And I should say as well, we combine, we just lump healthcare into the industrial sector as well. And we have seen -- this is the market where we have been investing, I would say, modestly but very determinedly over the last seven or eight years and we are beginning to really see the returns come good there in terms of revenue and profit. So, I'll give an example. Using integrated silicon photonics and signal processing technology, we've changed the way our customers can implement CT scanning and digital X-ray. We are bringing a clinical grade vital signs monitoring beyond the hospital into the clinic and the home. So, those are all things that are making a big difference to ADI. I should point out by the way as well, we are on a quarter -- we are on a quarter billion dollar run rate now with our healthcare business, with very, very good profits and a good outlook. Again, it’s a slower burn business, but it’s a terrific fit for the future for ADI. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely I wanted to ask the Trump question since I get it five or six times a day. So, who knows what this guy is going to come up with policy wise but maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on how you think this impacts you, what your concerns are, what you think any positives could come out of it for ADI and the industry? Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Vincent Roche It’s a good question, but we are getting into our 52nd year now as a company. So, we have gone through many regime changes across the world and many, many -- how many American presidents is that. So, I think it’s just wait and see. We don’t know. We hear like everybody else hear the rhetoric. We have yet got to see what the policy is going to look like, but maybe on the margins it will be good, at least for the American business environment. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Congrats on a really nice quarter here. I just want to go back to the Linear transaction for a second, maybe you have more time to go through this and review this. The number one question we tend to get is just how much of -- what sort of manufacturing optimization savings could you get from the transaction over time, and what sort of upside would that yield versus 150 million you talked about. So anything you can talk about just manufacturing integration optimization you can do and if that would be incremental to what you have talked about? Dave Zinsner Thanks Amit; that’s a good question. Let me start though since you asked -- opened up the Linear question, why don’t we just start at the beginning -- at the top here. We have actually spent the last several months really focusing on how integration will go as of day one. I would tell you that where we have gotten a lot more optimism is around revenue side. We were already coming into this and this is the reason we do an acquisition like this is to get revenue synergies. We are already coming into the acquisition thinking that we would get hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue upside over time because it takes a while to get that kind of revenue upside. But eventually, I would say that we are even more optimistic about getting revenue synergies, the teams have sat a number of times and talked through where there might be opportunities for the combined Company to really address markets and deliver products that we hadn’t in the past. And fruits of those conversations have been very, very positive. On the manufacturing side, I think that right now, we’re going to go in with the footprint that we have. And what we do and what we’ve always done is optimized that to our needs. And we’ll continue to look at it. So, I don’t know beyond -- I think we had roughly thought that there is about $50 million of manufacturing synergies through purchasing power and so forth. Whether there will be more several years down the road, we’ll just have to wait and see. But for now, I would call it about $50 million. And then, we expect there is probably another $100 million of OpEx synergies. There is a lot of early wins that we’ve identified through the efforts and planning the integration, obviously the public company expenses. But there is a lot of things that we spend in terms of outside services and so forth that we don’t need to spend two of. And so, I think we’ll get some very quick cost savings out of that activity. So, if anything, I think we’re very positive. I would tell you that the other thing we talked about when we announced the acquisition was that we thought our tax, blended tax rate will be 19.5%. I think today, now, we believe that’s more like 15%. So that actually pushes up the near-term accretion number from about 10% to probably about 15%. So, if anything, we’re more optimistic about the near-term and incredibly optimistic about the long-term. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Craig Ellis Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the excellent execution, guys. Just looking at the model, bottoms up and going back a bit to Ambrish’s question. So, if my model is correct, not only did you have record margins in the quarter but auto and industrial also had record quarters. And as I look at the outlook, the 13% midpoint year-on-year growth, relative to ADI’s history and global GDP growth, I think we’d typically look at the analog industry growing at a 2 to 2.5 times multiple of global GDP growth. You are growing at four times that. So, as we look at the business and where it is now and the early pay-off in some of the platform investments the Company has made, are we seeing the Company start to move into a phase where its growth rate relative to its own history and relative to the industry is now at a nice premium to what we would have seen in the post Lehmann and even pre-Lehmann periods? Vincent Roche  Yes. I think firstly, you’ve got to take growth over a longer period of time, it’s a longer integral.0 But, yes, as I’ve said, what makes me very optimistic about things is that we are innovating like never before and we’re solving big meaningful problems of greater impact. And our customer relationships are such that I think we’re very, very well-positioned to be able to partner with them to really uncover what they believe to be the most intractable challenges, both in terms of their innovation and their commercial impact. So, yes, I think we are innovating in a way that gives us tremendous opportunity for growth. And as I said, we’ve got the customers with us. So, I think I would expect -- we’ve said that our long-term growth model is two to three times GDP. I think we’re well positioned to at least deliver that organically. And as I said, when Ambrish asked the question earlier, we'll be updating our models over the coming couple of quarters, once we integrate LTC here. So, we'll give you more color and visibility. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon I guess I also had a housekeeping question. Dave, you mentioned that you thought consumer would be down in the ballpark of 30% sequentially next quarter. But, just mathematically, that doesn't give me the B2B down mid single-digits, B2B specific items will be down more than that. So, were you just sort of rounding on the consumer number or is there something else going on within that? Dave Zinsner No, it's surrounding on the consumer number. Stacy Rasgon So, you expect it to be down more? Dave Zinsner A little bit more. Stacy Rasgon Got it. So, that’s the housekeeping question, if I could ask the real question now. Just last year, you gave us a little bit of color on content increases for Apple and obviously the business consumer was down a little bit this year but not much with the content decrease offsetting the inventory reduction. What do you guys see for content increase on the next cycle for that product? Dave Zinsner I think it's too early to tell right now. I think we feel good about our content right now, whether there'll be any additional items, is I think difficult to say right now. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Actually just a follow-up there on the consumer side. The 30ish decline seems fairly normal, so just wondering if you can compare and contrast this year versus last year. And then, you have additional components, are you seeing any yield issues or anything else like you saw in this year or is it fairly smooth? Dave Zinsner Yes, we don't -- it's fairly smooth. I think what you saw kind of on a year-over-year basis, as we came down a little bit while increasing content. So, the driver of the opposite kind of force here was obviously the inventory build that happened last year that doesn't appear to be happening this year. So, it's kind of tracking as you would normally expect. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore On the OpEx side of things, I realize you only have a couple of quarters left before Linear comes into equation. But, Dave, can you walk us through why you're guiding it up sequentially? If I look historically, I can't find the quarter in the last four, five years where it was actually up. And then, how do you plan to manage the organic OpEx up until that Linear integration? Dave Zinsner Well, I'll take the second question first which is very carefully -- I mean, we're not looking to build or add a lot of resources right now because we're going to inherit a lot of resources from Linear Tech and we want to optimize the combined workforce that we're going to have going forward. So, we're very, very, very cautiously managing OpEx, I would say, for the most part keeping headcount flat, maybe there's one or two people here or there that we do need to add for one reason or the other. There's a dynamic within our compensation plan -- variable compensation plan that makes this phenomena happen every so often. And that's a situation where on a year-over-year basis we have pretty meaningful growth which is a component of our variable comp. And so, while, as you point out, we do a pretty good job with the fixed expenses, bringing them down in the first quarter on a sequential basis, and generally the same thing happens with the variable compensation. In this particular quarter, that's not going to be the case because of the year-over-year component is going to actually drive a higher bonus payout. So, that’s really the dynamic there. Otherwise, it would have been largely as you would have expected it to be managed in the first quarter. Ali Husain I think as you mentioned, Dave, in prepared remarks, the operating margin in the first quarter is still going to be I think in the midpoint around 32%, just pretty strong. I think we will have to go back five or six years to see those kinds of operating margins in the first quarter. Okay, good question. Next caller, please? Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong Your B2B segment, industrial, automotive, comms, they have all swung from year-over-year decline a couple of quarters ago to solid 6% to 7% growth in October. Sounds like your January comm guidance assumes about the same. Are you seeing any sub-segments of these accelerating or actually strengthening from that very good October level? Dave Zinsner I think they are all pretty much behaving, as you might expect. There are areas that we’re obviously seeing the strength in general. Vince mentioned the healthcare space, clearly aerospace and defense business has been good. Areas around IoT that we focused on have done well. There are sub-segments of the auto space like ADAS and powertrains and so forth. Vince mentioned A2B platform that we have in auto for infotainment area. So, all those things are doing probably on the margin little bit better. But I would say it is a very, very broad based situation with the B2B space and pretty much every sub-segment is doing well. Operator Your next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Steve Smigie I was hoping to get some quick color on LIDAR opportunity. What do you see that opportunity for you guys as and what does your acquisition bring to the table versus some of the competition out there? Vincent Roche Yes, good question. So, basically, the technology we have required is liquid crystal optical wave guide technology. And it’s a solid state approach to a very, very difficult problem, basically using a solid state approach to optical beam steering. That’s critical if you are going to really push the resolution of LIDAR in future. And in contrast to other beam steering methods, for example like MEMS mirrors, the spinners that you’ve seen running around highway 101, there are optical phase arrays. The technology we have acquired doesn’t have any sensitivity to vibration for example. So technically, we have got great frame rates, no blind spots, and we can run them and we steer the beam as well. So, this technology we believe puts us firmly on the LIDAR roadmap. And combined with our RADAR-based advanced driver systems technology at 24 and 77 gig really gives us two of the very critical technology modalities to enable not only greater safety which everybody craves in transportation but also puts us well on the path to enabling our customers to get closer to realizing autonomous driving as a major trend in the transportation sector. So that’s essentially what we see. And it’s a potentially beyond $1 billion semiconductor time for this thing for us. So, it could be potentially a wave. And that’s why we bought the technology. It is reasonably early stage but with the technology is working, now we’ve got to get it installed and make it work in the application. Operator And our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great, thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can address the reasoning behind the greater optimism for revenue synergies. Specifically is this more of an inside out view when you sit down with engineers and think about the products that you might be able to deliver or is it more customer driven where you’re hearing feedback that requests a combination of products, let’s say? Dave Zinsner I would say it is a combination. Vince can add some color if he wants. But I would say, it’s a combination of clearly the business units, call the engineering force and the business units do see opportunities for products that they could make that would be special. But I think a lot of it comes from just the sales force that the combined company looking at the other company’s portfolio and looking at their jobs what they could do with those products in their geographies, their customers and so forth. I think that’s really where we see a lot of kind of near side opportunities. Vincent Roche Yes. I think maybe as well in some -- particularly of the larger customers, there is an open door invitation to do more together with the portfolios that we have on hand as well as getting our engineering teams together to figure out how to create even more value in future together in terms of how we invest in R&D and apply it. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great execution and the recovery in the B2B segment. My question though is related to the consumer segment. And what is the right way to model that segment for the next two years? If you were in our shoes, would you model that segment to be flat, up or down? Just given the large influence of one of your customers in that segment, that’s really hard to model that. So, I was just wondering how you would be modeling it if you were in our shoes? Thank you. Vincent Roche Well, from a topline perspective, I’d say if we could get 10% growth compounded for the next few years in that business, we’d be very, very satisfied. Vivek Arya But, do you see -- do you have visibility for that, Vince? Vincent Roche Well, look, you really have visibility into anything. I mean, we work hard on building great products; we’re working very, very hard on deepening our penetration, not just in one customer but in several customers. It’s a rapid cycle business as well. And things can change, markets can change, products can hit, not hit products; products get -- can even at the customer level be brought to market or cancelled. So as best we can tell, we’re happy with the position we’re in, in terms of the products and technology we have, the relationships we’ve got with the critical customers in this space. So, I am optimistic that we can grow this business at the level I’ve said, and time will tell. We don’t know. We can’t predict because also it’s a market with relatively fickle customers on the other side of thing. But I think we’re well positioned to pick the upside and that’s pretty much what I’ve got to say about it. Dave Zinsner I mean, one thing I would add is that we do track kind of the opportunity set. We certainly have the opportunities to do what Vince said. And it is a matter of markets and applications taking off and so forth. But from an opportunity perspective, we're optimistic about what we can do in the consumer space. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer I guess, Vince, an earlier questioner rightly pointed out that within your B2B business, industrial and auto kind of established new all-time quarterly highs in the October quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the communications sector, still about 40 million below peak revenue run rate a few years ago. I know not all of Hittite gets wrapped up the comps but especially given the success at least on the design side from the Hittite acquisition, I'm just kind of curious as how you view the outlook for the comps business. Why is that the business that's still kind of struggling relative to past ties and what are kind of the growth drivers you see from here? Vincent Roche Well, again, I think you've got to take a very long-term view to the consumer space. We have been playing in this business from 1G into 4G; we're helping our customers with 4.5G. We’re at the early stages of helping them architect 5G technologies as well. It's an important market for ADI. And with Hittite, we're able to bring a level of completeness to our customer solutions. We're seeing the growth we expected out of Hittite that we had thought was there. We're getting the growth. We're well-positioned with our customers. And we're grinding out results in 4G. I think we're getting share in 4G. And on some of the older technologies, some of the 2.5, 3G technologies, clearly, there's price erosion, which offsets to some extent the growth that we got on 4G. But, I think the customers are facing increasingly difficult challenges in this space. We're helping them solve them at an increasing level of sophistication. So, it's a way for the future. And we'll grind out the results quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year. And I think as I said, we're in an increasingly good position to gain share in the space, particularly as we begin to push our products as well towards single chip radio solutions in future. So, I think there're very few companies standing in the radio who can build a sustainable business for the long term and ADI will be right at the top of that stack. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Caso with CLSA. Chris Caso I wondered if you could talk about what you consider to be normal seasonality for the April quarter. And I ask because last year was the first quarter of the substantial revenues from the consumer segment but that was undergoing the inventory adjustment. If we normalize for the inventory adjustment, what would your expectations be for normal April? Dave Zinsner It’s a good question, Chris. We're kind of in new territory. So, I'll take a crack at it but don't hold me to it. I would expect, as is typical, the industrial and automotive sectors to have pretty good sequential growth. I think the industrial sector usually has about 10% and usually the automotive sector is a little bit below 10% but they're both pretty strong. Comms will do what it does; it's more cyclical than seasonal I think in most cases. And then, the consumer business which is the big wild card, I am going to guess that it’s down probably the same kind of level sequentially as it was in the first quarter, probably in the 30% plus or minus or something like that in the second quarter again and of course will have rebound after that in the third and fourth quarter as it seasonally does. But it’s hard to say but that will be my guess. Operator Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. I had a question on your incremental gross margins. I think for the October quarter on a year-over-year basis, most of your revenue growth dropped through to the gross margin line. And also for the January quarter, if we take the midpoint of your revenue and gross margin guide, again, I think close to 90% or 100% of your revenue growth is dropping through the bottom line. So, I guess, I am curious, is this just product mix or are there other factors that play here? Thank you. Dave Zinsner Yes. I think drop-through works when there isn’t a lot of like a changes going on around working capital and so forth. And I think that kind of masking things a bit. Like for example in the fourth quarter, as I talked about, we had this inventory release which drove up the gross margin. So, you have to kind of strip that away before you even look at it. And then in the first quarter, we are -- because we normally have this kind of utilization decline in the first quarter, we are not going to have that because of such of the really good discipline we had through the year this year in terms of inventory management; it’s a utilization level that’s kind of atypical for us. So, I am not sure drop-through is the best way to look at it. It’s more a function of, at least in the first quarter, it’s a more function of utilization levels. And they are going to be in the mid to high 60s. And that’s going to be really beneficial relative to where we were last year, at this time, which is kind of unusual for us. Operator Your next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore. CJ Muse I was hoping to revisit the earlier comments regarding a 10% CAGR for consumer. If you look at your top customer in that bucket, I think 13% of your total revs in fiscal 2016 that would imply your other consumer business decline about 25% year-on-year. So, curious, the 10% CAGR, is that a reflection of your vision to rising content as you have very large customer there or is it reflection of seeing greater breadth with other consumer customers as you look out over the next one, two, three years? Vincent Roche Well, I think it’s a combination of all of the above. It’s a long term projection. As I said, we have certainly got the customer engagements. We have got the technologies and products. And I think we are solving problems that really matter. So, what I am indicating is that to my mind it’s probably more of a how the market performs than individual, if you like dynamics around engagements and individual customer. So, it's really more about the market. So, I think what we are talking about is a long-term expectation. We are investing at a rate that should enable us to get those kind of growth rates. I will say as well that we have funded our B2B business; I mean, we are spending more than 90% of the Company's R&D on our B2B businesses to make sure that we drive growth and capture the opportunity that’s available to us in those sectors. So, we’re all the time making trade-offs and investment between the various applications in the B2B area. And we are very carefully picking up the vital few opportunities in consumer where we think our technology makes an enormous difference to the user experience. Ali Husain Just a clarification, the outside of the portables business within consumer, so outside of portables consumer was up sequentially and was about stable to the prior year. Okay, next question? Operator Next question comes from Romit Shah with Instinet. Romit Shah Yes, hi. Just regarding the merger, it sounds like early indications are good. But one of the things that’s come up is just employee retention, something to that extent was mentioned in the proxy. And one of the -- for some of us who have followed Linear over the years know that it’s kind of a different culture West Coast company. So, I am just curious, how are you guys incentivizing the Linear people to stay at the organization? And Dave, as we put our merger models together, should we assume that OpEx and stock comp sort of step up on a like-for-like basis after the deal closes? Dave Zinsner Well, we do have our retention plan in place for them. So, near-term, we’re not too worried about it. But I would tell you that my own view on this, since I can probably opine is that engineers stay with the company or come to a company based on what they are doing and whether they are doing exciting things and have granted the opportunity to work on really difficult problems and do amazing things. And that’s the environment we intend to create for both the ADI and Linear Tech engineers. So, I am not particularly worried about it. Our compensation plan in the near-term for ADI and Linear Tech people is to maintain what both of them have. Over time, they will be how homogenized but I think in a way that we wouldn’t see a negative impact of. Vincent Roche Yes, I’ll just add a little more color to what Dave has said, Romit. I spend a lot of time as many of our leaders have with the LTC engineering community, the business community, the operations community and we share a very similar view of the world. We understand our each others’ businesses very, very well. We share a very similar value system, how we believe value gets created and captured. And I think there is tremendous excitement by the way, all through both companies incidentally about how we can combine the complementary technology suites of both companies to do really marvelous things in future. As Dave said earlier that our sales forces are really jumping at the bid to get the two bags, for the ADI people to get the LT power bag and the LT says people to get the ADI mix signal bag and really capture the opportunity that we think is a available to both of us over the next three to four years. And I think as Dave said, a part of retention is a sense of equity and fair treatment in terms of compensation. And we pay a lot of attention to that. But the soft side of the adventure that people can undertake here and work together to do amazing things into the future, solving really critical meaningful problems of the world, that’s what people want to do. And I will tell you as well, we pay lot of attention to retention. And I'm pleased to say that things are very, very stable on both sides of the fence. Operator Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing You mentioned pricing efficiencies helping gross margins year-over-year, looking for color on that. You've a pretty capable team in place now and for a while you've been -- I've been assuming you have been posting by value of solutions? Dave Zinsner I mean it's basically that. I mean we're -- as Vince mentioned I think in one of the questions, we're increasingly putting more and more robust technology in the products, some cases algorithms, some cases other software, some cases it's just hardware but it's just really solving a really challenging problem. And what we do is work to try to get commensurate price for that value that we create. And not surprisingly in a big organization, sometimes a little bit of that slips through the cracks. And what we've been doing over the last three years is plugging those holes. And so, we're not looking to gouge our customers by any means, we're looking to find the right optimal level of price per value and that’s what we do every day. I think we've done increasingly a better job at that over time. Operator Your next question is from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Harsh Kumar On that answer you gave, there seems to be some trend amongst semiconductor companies that they can actually get paid very well for what they're doing. Historically, it's always been downward pricing but now, I think some of the companies are trying to raise prices and maybe get paid fairly. I'm curious, you mentioned, you touched upon in the previous answer, but I'm curious where your philosophy is as a company with that and how much of an impact did pricing have in margins for the last quarter? Dave Zinsner So, I think, Harsh, I would say that some companies who have been drifting into the 40s and maybe very low 50s in terms of gross margin, they got to get a whole new kind of philosophy in place for pricing. I mean, we already had 60 plus percent gross margin, so we were actually pretty good at executing a strategy around this. It was more just cleaning up a little bit around the edges where we probably weren't executing as well. Hard to put a number on it for the quarter. I would say though that on the average over the last say four years, our ASPs are probably up 30%, 40% probably. So, it's obviously been a pretty big impact in terms of our gross margins. Operator Your next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree Maybe just any more color that you could give on the wireline business, and you made some comments about strength you're seeing in 100 gig? Vincent Roche So, we have a reasonably significant business in the optical space and providing precision measurement and control for the various parts of the optical system. So, it's grown well for the Company over several years. And I think as the need for data center, infrastructure build-out continues and medium and long-haul, backhaul connectivity continues to be pressured, we see it as a good bet for the future and probably at the higher end of the spectrum of growth that we've put into our model. Operator And our last question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin I had a quick question on wireless infrastructures. I know that was down in the quarter. Was that broad-based softness in that business or were there any pockets of the positive demand? And also related to that, how would you characterize the current I guess level of rollout 4G and 4.5G overall, are there any more greenfield or upgrade opportunity left around the world in next couple of years? Thanks. Vincent Roche Yes. So, I guess in the quarter the macro base station and the backhaul were down for the quarter. Our small selectivity was up. I think China is reasonably strong. And our transceiver pipeline by the way across the board, not just in base station technology but across the board is continuing to build a nice pipeline of opportunity. And also, we are converting a pipeline into decent revenue. I think we are still in the reasonably -- I mean 4G is going to be around for a long, long time to come. The largest part of the world by the way is still on 2G, 2.5G and 3G networks. So, 4G will have a long life ahead of it. And as I said, we will be grinding out share gains there in an increasingly thinning atmosphere here, if you like in terms of suppliers. 5G is on its way. As I said, we’re in the earlier stages of helping our customers to architect 5G solutions. But I think it’s going to be many, many years out yet. So, I think it will be -- I don’t expect to see capital deployments and the carriers change an awful lot. So, I think it will be a slow and steady increase in the build out of 4G. And I think that will be the environment till we get the 5G and see another specific step function ramp here. Ali Husain Alright, thanks Stephen. It looks like it's the end of the call. We had a good quarter. The deal here for Linear Tech continues to stay on track, progressing well here for close. Inventory, as Dave has talked about, is in great shape, gives us good gross margin leverage going into 2017. Our business is now showing some really good momentum, especially in the B2B markets. You guys saw the results of some pretty some operational execution this quarter with our free cash flow margins up pretty significantly. So, we appreciate you guys calling in. And we’ll look to talk to you soon. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you. I know the rule but I had a quick fact check for Dave and then I had a longer term for Vince. Dave, I apologize if I am missing it, usually in your prepared press release, you do get the end-market breakdown for the coming quarter. I don’t think I saw at this time. Dave Zinsner Yes. Maybe we ordinarily do. Okay, I’ll give you two questions, Ambrish. I would say just kind of directionally the B2B businesses which we would consider industrial, automotive and communications will roughly be down mid-single digits. And of course consumer, I think would be roughly in the 30% down range. Does that answer your question, Ambrish? Ambrish Srivastava Yes, thank you. My other one was a bit of a longer term for you, Vince. And this is going back to a conversation you and I had a while ago. I know you’ve been on a path to transforming ADI and you’ve talked about inorganic as well as organic, and thinking more of a value creation as opposed to what we are used to, design-in, design-out. You kind of showed it in the consumer side so far that you are not a one socket win. But, give us a perspective of where we are. I know baseball season is over and I love cricket but cricket is bad analogy, there is only two innings. So, where are we in the transformation, Vince? And just help us with that perspective. Thank you.  Vincent Roche Yes, thanks Ambrish. Good questions. So, look, we are on a journey. We believe -- we said several years ago, we believe that there is enough impetus in our business and that we have the balance sheet as well to help us get this Company towards $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in a reasonable period of time. We are well on track. I believe over the next several years, we will be updating -- obviously when we integrate LTC, we will be updating all the benchmarks around what we expect our revenue to be over time, profits, free cash flow and so and so forth. So, I don’t know, I am not a cricket fan at all, Ambrish. I don’t know cricket. And I am only an amateur in terms of understanding baseball. But, I would say, we are still in the probably the first quarter of the transformation. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. That’s football. Vincent Roche So, we have plenty of upsides. As I said, what makes me very optimistic about this business is that the analog domain essentially sets the performance for all the systems that make up this massive information communications technology sector. It’s one of the foundational technologies. Our customers are asking us for more, more and more. And we are getting to the point now where we can be very, very choosey about the problems that we solve. And we can solve those problems across the board from microwave to mix signal to digital single processing, to power sensor technologies. So, I think there is a huge innovation upside that’s the root of this Company. We are in a better and better position with our customers. So, I am very optimistic that we can get this business well-beyond $5 billion in a reasonable period of time. Ambrish Srivastava Okay, Thank you. Happy Thanksgiving, guys. Vincent Roche Many happy returns. Ali Husain Thanks, Ambrish. Next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Great execution, guys. Dave, can you remind us where utilization is right now? And what are your plans for the next quarter? Obviously you’ve done a great job bringing the inventory day down, but kind of as we look forward from here on, how should we think about utilization in inventories? Dave Zinsner So, utilization was in the kind of high 60s in the fourth quarter. I would expect it to be roughly in that range in the first quarter, which is somewhat atypical for us for our first quarter because generally we're working our inventory back down in the first quarter and with industrial usually having a sequential decline in the first quarter as well, it generally drives our utilization down a bit. But given that we've done so well, the operations group has done so well in terms of managing inventory this year, we can keep utilization a little bit higher going into the first quarter. Operator Your next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Related question on the gross margin guidance, when we adjust for the sale of previously reserved product, you have a sequential trend in gross margin guidance that's better than seasonal. And you just mentioned the utilization rate being better than what you'd see typically in fiscal quarter. Is there anything else in terms of mix that also has an impact on the gross margin, maybe some weakness in base station or anything else that you could give us color on? Dave Zinsner I think it's generally utilization that's going to drive it. Because in reality, mix on a year-over-year basis is actually a little bit worse. Because if you remember the first quarter was a pretty difficult quarter for us with regard to consumer came down quite a bit. This year, it won't have as dramatic a decline. And so, mix is a little bit negative but utilization will offset. And I'd say the other thing just anecdotally as the operations group has done a very good job on the spending side, just really managing the expenses there. And so we've incrementally, I'd say, every year have been doing a bit better in terms of spending. And then on top of that there's obviously, as I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we've been focused on pricing as well. And so, I think those things have just had an incrementally little bit of a benefit every quarter. And then, of course utilization drives a lot of it and the offset would be mix. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach On industrial and understanding there is a big macro overlay to industrial but nice to see the broad based strength. Can you talk about, Vince, just maybe some of the applications or products that you're excited about in terms of where you're seeing some investment by your industrial customers? Vincent Roche Yes. I mentioned in the prepared remarks there, Craig, for example, in our core businesses, like robotics for example, there's a need to be able to push the speed and the accuracy of these robots to ever higher levels. That's a tremendous digital signal processing challenge. And we've been building complete solutions that are only coming to fruition now for that area to enable much higher speeds in the operation of the robots with lower power, much greater accuracy. So, it's a complete signal chain of digital signal processing technology and mix signal technology. I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well some of these software defined input-output structures that are enabling our customers to deepen the penetration of sensors into their environments and to dramatically reduce the complexity of installation and the costs. Energy is another area. It’s a slow burn market but it’s an area where we have tremendous technology in transmission and distribution and also in the metering of energy. So, those are just a couple of areas. And I should say as well, we combine, we just lump healthcare into the industrial sector as well. And we have seen -- this is the market where we have been investing, I would say, modestly but very determinedly over the last seven or eight years and we are beginning to really see the returns come good there in terms of revenue and profit. So, I'll give an example. Using integrated silicon photonics and signal processing technology, we've changed the way our customers can implement CT scanning and digital X-ray. We are bringing a clinical grade vital signs monitoring beyond the hospital into the clinic and the home. So, those are all things that are making a big difference to ADI. I should point out by the way as well, we are on a quarter -- we are on a quarter billion dollar run rate now with our healthcare business, with very, very good profits and a good outlook. Again, it’s a slower burn business, but it’s a terrific fit for the future for ADI. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely I wanted to ask the Trump question since I get it five or six times a day. So, who knows what this guy is going to come up with policy wise but maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on how you think this impacts you, what your concerns are, what you think any positives could come out of it for ADI and the industry? Any thoughts there would be appreciated. Vincent Roche It’s a good question, but we are getting into our 52nd year now as a company. So, we have gone through many regime changes across the world and many, many -- how many American presidents is that. So, I think it’s just wait and see. We don’t know. We hear like everybody else hear the rhetoric. We have yet got to see what the policy is going to look like, but maybe on the margins it will be good, at least for the American business environment. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Congrats on a really nice quarter here. I just want to go back to the Linear transaction for a second, maybe you have more time to go through this and review this. The number one question we tend to get is just how much of -- what sort of manufacturing optimization savings could you get from the transaction over time, and what sort of upside would that yield versus 150 million you talked about. So anything you can talk about just manufacturing integration optimization you can do and if that would be incremental to what you have talked about? Dave Zinsner Thanks Amit; that’s a good question. Let me start though since you asked -- opened up the Linear question, why don’t we just start at the beginning -- at the top here. We have actually spent the last several months really focusing on how integration will go as of day one. I would tell you that where we have gotten a lot more optimism is around revenue side. We were already coming into this and this is the reason we do an acquisition like this is to get revenue synergies. We are already coming into the acquisition thinking that we would get hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue upside over time because it takes a while to get that kind of revenue upside. But eventually, I would say that we are even more optimistic about getting revenue synergies, the teams have sat a number of times and talked through where there might be opportunities for the combined Company to really address markets and deliver products that we hadn’t in the past. And fruits of those conversations have been very, very positive. On the manufacturing side, I think that right now, we’re going to go in with the footprint that we have. And what we do and what we’ve always done is optimized that to our needs. And we’ll continue to look at it. So, I don’t know beyond -- I think we had roughly thought that there is about $50 million of manufacturing synergies through purchasing power and so forth. Whether there will be more several years down the road, we’ll just have to wait and see. But for now, I would call it about $50 million. And then, we expect there is probably another $100 million of OpEx synergies. There is a lot of early wins that we’ve identified through the efforts and planning the integration, obviously the public company expenses. But there is a lot of things that we spend in terms of outside services and so forth that we don’t need to spend two of. And so, I think we’ll get some very quick cost savings out of that activity. So, if anything, I think we’re very positive. I would tell you that the other thing we talked about when we announced the acquisition was that we thought our tax, blended tax rate will be 19.5%. I think today, now, we believe that’s more like 15%. So that actually pushes up the near-term accretion number from about 10% to probably about 15%. So, if anything, we’re more optimistic about the near-term and incredibly optimistic about the long-term. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Craig Ellis Thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the excellent execution, guys. Just looking at the model, bottoms up and going back a bit to Ambrish’s question. So, if my model is correct, not only did you have record margins in the quarter but auto and industrial also had record quarters. And as I look at the outlook, the 13% midpoint year-on-year growth, relative to ADI’s history and global GDP growth, I think we’d typically look at the analog industry growing at a 2 to 2.5 times multiple of global GDP growth. You are growing at four times that. So, as we look at the business and where it is now and the early pay-off in some of the platform investments the Company has made, are we seeing the Company start to move into a phase where its growth rate relative to its own history and relative to the industry is now at a nice premium to what we would have seen in the post Lehmann and even pre-Lehmann periods? Vincent Roche  Yes. I think firstly, you’ve got to take growth over a longer period of time, it’s a longer integral.0 But, yes, as I’ve said, what makes me very optimistic about things is that we are innovating like never before and we’re solving big meaningful problems of greater impact. And our customer relationships are such that I think we’re very, very well-positioned to be able to partner with them to really uncover what they believe to be the most intractable challenges, both in terms of their innovation and their commercial impact. So, yes, I think we are innovating in a way that gives us tremendous opportunity for growth. And as I said, we’ve got the customers with us. So, I think I would expect -- we’ve said that our long-term growth model is two to three times GDP. I think we’re well positioned to at least deliver that organically. And as I said, when Ambrish asked the question earlier, we'll be updating our models over the coming couple of quarters, once we integrate LTC here. So, we'll give you more color and visibility. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon I guess I also had a housekeeping question. Dave, you mentioned that you thought consumer would be down in the ballpark of 30% sequentially next quarter. But, just mathematically, that doesn't give me the B2B down mid single-digits, B2B specific items will be down more than that. So, were you just sort of rounding on the consumer number or is there something else going on within that? Dave Zinsner No, it's surrounding on the consumer number. Stacy Rasgon So, you expect it to be down more? Dave Zinsner A little bit more. Stacy Rasgon Got it. So, that’s the housekeeping question, if I could ask the real question now. Just last year, you gave us a little bit of color on content increases for Apple and obviously the business consumer was down a little bit this year but not much with the content decrease offsetting the inventory reduction. What do you guys see for content increase on the next cycle for that product? Dave Zinsner I think it's too early to tell right now. I think we feel good about our content right now, whether there'll be any additional items, is I think difficult to say right now. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Actually just a follow-up there on the consumer side. The 30ish decline seems fairly normal, so just wondering if you can compare and contrast this year versus last year. And then, you have additional components, are you seeing any yield issues or anything else like you saw in this year or is it fairly smooth? Dave Zinsner Yes, we don't -- it's fairly smooth. I think what you saw kind of on a year-over-year basis, as we came down a little bit while increasing content. So, the driver of the opposite kind of force here was obviously the inventory build that happened last year that doesn't appear to be happening this year. So, it's kind of tracking as you would normally expect. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore On the OpEx side of things, I realize you only have a couple of quarters left before Linear comes into equation. But, Dave, can you walk us through why you're guiding it up sequentially? If I look historically, I can't find the quarter in the last four, five years where it was actually up. And then, how do you plan to manage the organic OpEx up until that Linear integration? Dave Zinsner Well, I'll take the second question first which is very carefully -- I mean, we're not looking to build or add a lot of resources right now because we're going to inherit a lot of resources from Linear Tech and we want to optimize the combined workforce that we're going to have going forward. So, we're very, very, very cautiously managing OpEx, I would say, for the most part keeping headcount flat, maybe there's one or two people here or there that we do need to add for one reason or the other. There's a dynamic within our compensation plan -- variable compensation plan that makes this phenomena happen every so often. And that's a situation where on a year-over-year basis we have pretty meaningful growth which is a component of our variable comp. And so, while, as you point out, we do a pretty good job with the fixed expenses, bringing them down in the first quarter on a sequential basis, and generally the same thing happens with the variable compensation. In this particular quarter, that's not going to be the case because of the year-over-year component is going to actually drive a higher bonus payout. So, that’s really the dynamic there. Otherwise, it would have been largely as you would have expected it to be managed in the first quarter. Ali Husain I think as you mentioned, Dave, in prepared remarks, the operating margin in the first quarter is still going to be I think in the midpoint around 32%, just pretty strong. I think we will have to go back five or six years to see those kinds of operating margins in the first quarter. Okay, good question. Next caller, please? Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David Wong Your B2B segment, industrial, automotive, comms, they have all swung from year-over-year decline a couple of quarters ago to solid 6% to 7% growth in October. Sounds like your January comm guidance assumes about the same. Are you seeing any sub-segments of these accelerating or actually strengthening from that very good October level? Dave Zinsner I think they are all pretty much behaving, as you might expect. There are areas that we’re obviously seeing the strength in general. Vince mentioned the healthcare space, clearly aerospace and defense business has been good. Areas around IoT that we focused on have done well. There are sub-segments of the auto space like ADAS and powertrains and so forth. Vince mentioned A2B platform that we have in auto for infotainment area. So, all those things are doing probably on the margin little bit better. But I would say it is a very, very broad based situation with the B2B space and pretty much every sub-segment is doing well. Operator Your next question is from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Steve Smigie I was hoping to get some quick color on LIDAR opportunity. What do you see that opportunity for you guys as and what does your acquisition bring to the table versus some of the competition out there? Vincent Roche Yes, good question. So, basically, the technology we have required is liquid crystal optical wave guide technology. And it’s a solid state approach to a very, very difficult problem, basically using a solid state approach to optical beam steering. That’s critical if you are going to really push the resolution of LIDAR in future. And in contrast to other beam steering methods, for example like MEMS mirrors, the spinners that you’ve seen running around highway 101, there are optical phase arrays. The technology we have acquired doesn’t have any sensitivity to vibration for example. So technically, we have got great frame rates, no blind spots, and we can run them and we steer the beam as well. So, this technology we believe puts us firmly on the LIDAR roadmap. And combined with our RADAR-based advanced driver systems technology at 24 and 77 gig really gives us two of the very critical technology modalities to enable not only greater safety which everybody craves in transportation but also puts us well on the path to enabling our customers to get closer to realizing autonomous driving as a major trend in the transportation sector. So that’s essentially what we see. And it’s a potentially beyond $1 billion semiconductor time for this thing for us. So, it could be potentially a wave. And that’s why we bought the technology. It is reasonably early stage but with the technology is working, now we’ve got to get it installed and make it work in the application. Operator And our next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great, thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can address the reasoning behind the greater optimism for revenue synergies. Specifically is this more of an inside out view when you sit down with engineers and think about the products that you might be able to deliver or is it more customer driven where you’re hearing feedback that requests a combination of products, let’s say? Dave Zinsner I would say it is a combination. Vince can add some color if he wants. But I would say, it’s a combination of clearly the business units, call the engineering force and the business units do see opportunities for products that they could make that would be special. But I think a lot of it comes from just the sales force that the combined company looking at the other company’s portfolio and looking at their jobs what they could do with those products in their geographies, their customers and so forth. I think that’s really where we see a lot of kind of near side opportunities. Vincent Roche Yes. I think maybe as well in some -- particularly of the larger customers, there is an open door invitation to do more together with the portfolios that we have on hand as well as getting our engineering teams together to figure out how to create even more value in future together in terms of how we invest in R&D and apply it. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great execution and the recovery in the B2B segment. My question though is related to the consumer segment. And what is the right way to model that segment for the next two years? If you were in our shoes, would you model that segment to be flat, up or down? Just given the large influence of one of your customers in that segment, that’s really hard to model that. So, I was just wondering how you would be modeling it if you were in our shoes? Thank you. Vincent Roche Well, from a topline perspective, I’d say if we could get 10% growth compounded for the next few years in that business, we’d be very, very satisfied. Vivek Arya But, do you see -- do you have visibility for that, Vince? Vincent Roche Well, look, you really have visibility into anything. I mean, we work hard on building great products; we’re working very, very hard on deepening our penetration, not just in one customer but in several customers. It’s a rapid cycle business as well. And things can change, markets can change, products can hit, not hit products; products get -- can even at the customer level be brought to market or cancelled. So as best we can tell, we’re happy with the position we’re in, in terms of the products and technology we have, the relationships we’ve got with the critical customers in this space. So, I am optimistic that we can grow this business at the level I’ve said, and time will tell. We don’t know. We can’t predict because also it’s a market with relatively fickle customers on the other side of thing. But I think we’re well positioned to pick the upside and that’s pretty much what I’ve got to say about it. Dave Zinsner I mean, one thing I would add is that we do track kind of the opportunity set. We certainly have the opportunities to do what Vince said. And it is a matter of markets and applications taking off and so forth. But from an opportunity perspective, we're optimistic about what we can do in the consumer space. Operator Your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer I guess, Vince, an earlier questioner rightly pointed out that within your B2B business, industrial and auto kind of established new all-time quarterly highs in the October quarter. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the communications sector, still about 40 million below peak revenue run rate a few years ago. I know not all of Hittite gets wrapped up the comps but especially given the success at least on the design side from the Hittite acquisition, I'm just kind of curious as how you view the outlook for the comps business. Why is that the business that's still kind of struggling relative to past ties and what are kind of the growth drivers you see from here? Vincent Roche Well, again, I think you've got to take a very long-term view to the consumer space. We have been playing in this business from 1G into 4G; we're helping our customers with 4.5G. We’re at the early stages of helping them architect 5G technologies as well. It's an important market for ADI. And with Hittite, we're able to bring a level of completeness to our customer solutions. We're seeing the growth we expected out of Hittite that we had thought was there. We're getting the growth. We're well-positioned with our customers. And we're grinding out results in 4G. I think we're getting share in 4G. And on some of the older technologies, some of the 2.5, 3G technologies, clearly, there's price erosion, which offsets to some extent the growth that we got on 4G. But, I think the customers are facing increasingly difficult challenges in this space. We're helping them solve them at an increasing level of sophistication. So, it's a way for the future. And we'll grind out the results quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year. And I think as I said, we're in an increasingly good position to gain share in the space, particularly as we begin to push our products as well towards single chip radio solutions in future. So, I think there're very few companies standing in the radio who can build a sustainable business for the long term and ADI will be right at the top of that stack. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Caso with CLSA. Chris Caso I wondered if you could talk about what you consider to be normal seasonality for the April quarter. And I ask because last year was the first quarter of the substantial revenues from the consumer segment but that was undergoing the inventory adjustment. If we normalize for the inventory adjustment, what would your expectations be for normal April? Dave Zinsner It’s a good question, Chris. We're kind of in new territory. So, I'll take a crack at it but don't hold me to it. I would expect, as is typical, the industrial and automotive sectors to have pretty good sequential growth. I think the industrial sector usually has about 10% and usually the automotive sector is a little bit below 10% but they're both pretty strong. Comms will do what it does; it's more cyclical than seasonal I think in most cases. And then, the consumer business which is the big wild card, I am going to guess that it’s down probably the same kind of level sequentially as it was in the first quarter, probably in the 30% plus or minus or something like that in the second quarter again and of course will have rebound after that in the third and fourth quarter as it seasonally does. But it’s hard to say but that will be my guess. Operator Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on a very strong quarter. I had a question on your incremental gross margins. I think for the October quarter on a year-over-year basis, most of your revenue growth dropped through to the gross margin line. And also for the January quarter, if we take the midpoint of your revenue and gross margin guide, again, I think close to 90% or 100% of your revenue growth is dropping through the bottom line. So, I guess, I am curious, is this just product mix or are there other factors that play here? Thank you. Dave Zinsner Yes. I think drop-through works when there isn’t a lot of like a changes going on around working capital and so forth. And I think that kind of masking things a bit. Like for example in the fourth quarter, as I talked about, we had this inventory release which drove up the gross margin. So, you have to kind of strip that away before you even look at it. And then in the first quarter, we are -- because we normally have this kind of utilization decline in the first quarter, we are not going to have that because of such of the really good discipline we had through the year this year in terms of inventory management; it’s a utilization level that’s kind of atypical for us. So, I am not sure drop-through is the best way to look at it. It’s more a function of, at least in the first quarter, it’s a more function of utilization levels. And they are going to be in the mid to high 60s. And that’s going to be really beneficial relative to where we were last year, at this time, which is kind of unusual for us. Operator Your next question comes from CJ Muse with Evercore. CJ Muse I was hoping to revisit the earlier comments regarding a 10% CAGR for consumer. If you look at your top customer in that bucket, I think 13% of your total revs in fiscal 2016 that would imply your other consumer business decline about 25% year-on-year. So, curious, the 10% CAGR, is that a reflection of your vision to rising content as you have very large customer there or is it reflection of seeing greater breadth with other consumer customers as you look out over the next one, two, three years? Vincent Roche Well, I think it’s a combination of all of the above. It’s a long term projection. As I said, we have certainly got the customer engagements. We have got the technologies and products. And I think we are solving problems that really matter. So, what I am indicating is that to my mind it’s probably more of a how the market performs than individual, if you like dynamics around engagements and individual customer. So, it's really more about the market. So, I think what we are talking about is a long-term expectation. We are investing at a rate that should enable us to get those kind of growth rates. I will say as well that we have funded our B2B business; I mean, we are spending more than 90% of the Company's R&D on our B2B businesses to make sure that we drive growth and capture the opportunity that’s available to us in those sectors. So, we’re all the time making trade-offs and investment between the various applications in the B2B area. And we are very carefully picking up the vital few opportunities in consumer where we think our technology makes an enormous difference to the user experience. Ali Husain Just a clarification, the outside of the portables business within consumer, so outside of portables consumer was up sequentially and was about stable to the prior year. Okay, next question? Operator Next question comes from Romit Shah with Instinet. Romit Shah Yes, hi. Just regarding the merger, it sounds like early indications are good. But one of the things that’s come up is just employee retention, something to that extent was mentioned in the proxy. And one of the -- for some of us who have followed Linear over the years know that it’s kind of a different culture West Coast company. So, I am just curious, how are you guys incentivizing the Linear people to stay at the organization? And Dave, as we put our merger models together, should we assume that OpEx and stock comp sort of step up on a like-for-like basis after the deal closes? Dave Zinsner Well, we do have our retention plan in place for them. So, near-term, we’re not too worried about it. But I would tell you that my own view on this, since I can probably opine is that engineers stay with the company or come to a company based on what they are doing and whether they are doing exciting things and have granted the opportunity to work on really difficult problems and do amazing things. And that’s the environment we intend to create for both the ADI and Linear Tech engineers. So, I am not particularly worried about it. Our compensation plan in the near-term for ADI and Linear Tech people is to maintain what both of them have. Over time, they will be how homogenized but I think in a way that we wouldn’t see a negative impact of. Vincent Roche Yes, I’ll just add a little more color to what Dave has said, Romit. I spend a lot of time as many of our leaders have with the LTC engineering community, the business community, the operations community and we share a very similar view of the world. We understand our each others’ businesses very, very well. We share a very similar value system, how we believe value gets created and captured. And I think there is tremendous excitement by the way, all through both companies incidentally about how we can combine the complementary technology suites of both companies to do really marvelous things in future. As Dave said earlier that our sales forces are really jumping at the bid to get the two bags, for the ADI people to get the LT power bag and the LT says people to get the ADI mix signal bag and really capture the opportunity that we think is a available to both of us over the next three to four years. And I think as Dave said, a part of retention is a sense of equity and fair treatment in terms of compensation. And we pay a lot of attention to that. But the soft side of the adventure that people can undertake here and work together to do amazing things into the future, solving really critical meaningful problems of the world, that’s what people want to do. And I will tell you as well, we pay lot of attention to retention. And I'm pleased to say that things are very, very stable on both sides of the fence. Operator Your next question comes from Ian Ing with MKM Partners. Ian Ing You mentioned pricing efficiencies helping gross margins year-over-year, looking for color on that. You've a pretty capable team in place now and for a while you've been -- I've been assuming you have been posting by value of solutions? Dave Zinsner I mean it's basically that. I mean we're -- as Vince mentioned I think in one of the questions, we're increasingly putting more and more robust technology in the products, some cases algorithms, some cases other software, some cases it's just hardware but it's just really solving a really challenging problem. And what we do is work to try to get commensurate price for that value that we create. And not surprisingly in a big organization, sometimes a little bit of that slips through the cracks. And what we've been doing over the last three years is plugging those holes. And so, we're not looking to gouge our customers by any means, we're looking to find the right optimal level of price per value and that’s what we do every day. I think we've done increasingly a better job at that over time. Operator Your next question is from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Harsh Kumar On that answer you gave, there seems to be some trend amongst semiconductor companies that they can actually get paid very well for what they're doing. Historically, it's always been downward pricing but now, I think some of the companies are trying to raise prices and maybe get paid fairly. I'm curious, you mentioned, you touched upon in the previous answer, but I'm curious where your philosophy is as a company with that and how much of an impact did pricing have in margins for the last quarter? Dave Zinsner So, I think, Harsh, I would say that some companies who have been drifting into the 40s and maybe very low 50s in terms of gross margin, they got to get a whole new kind of philosophy in place for pricing. I mean, we already had 60 plus percent gross margin, so we were actually pretty good at executing a strategy around this. It was more just cleaning up a little bit around the edges where we probably weren't executing as well. Hard to put a number on it for the quarter. I would say though that on the average over the last say four years, our ASPs are probably up 30%, 40% probably. So, it's obviously been a pretty big impact in terms of our gross margins. Operator Your next question is from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree Maybe just any more color that you could give on the wireline business, and you made some comments about strength you're seeing in 100 gig? Vincent Roche So, we have a reasonably significant business in the optical space and providing precision measurement and control for the various parts of the optical system. So, it's grown well for the Company over several years. And I think as the need for data center, infrastructure build-out continues and medium and long-haul, backhaul connectivity continues to be pressured, we see it as a good bet for the future and probably at the higher end of the spectrum of growth that we've put into our model. Operator And our last question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin I had a quick question on wireless infrastructures. I know that was down in the quarter. Was that broad-based softness in that business or were there any pockets of the positive demand? And also related to that, how would you characterize the current I guess level of rollout 4G and 4.5G overall, are there any more greenfield or upgrade opportunity left around the world in next couple of years? Thanks. Vincent Roche Yes. So, I guess in the quarter the macro base station and the backhaul were down for the quarter. Our small selectivity was up. I think China is reasonably strong. And our transceiver pipeline by the way across the board, not just in base station technology but across the board is continuing to build a nice pipeline of opportunity. And also, we are converting a pipeline into decent revenue. I think we are still in the reasonably -- I mean 4G is going to be around for a long, long time to come. The largest part of the world by the way is still on 2G, 2.5G and 3G networks. So, 4G will have a long life ahead of it. And as I said, we will be grinding out share gains there in an increasingly thinning atmosphere here, if you like in terms of suppliers. 5G is on its way. As I said, we’re in the earlier stages of helping our customers to architect 5G solutions. But I think it’s going to be many, many years out yet. So, I think it will be -- I don’t expect to see capital deployments and the carriers change an awful lot. So, I think it will be a slow and steady increase in the build out of 4G. And I think that will be the environment till we get the 5G and see another specific step function ramp here. Ali Husain Alright, thanks Stephen. It looks like it's the end of the call. We had a good quarter. The deal here for Linear Tech continues to stay on track, progressing well here for close. Inventory, as Dave has talked about, is in great shape, gives us good gross margin leverage going into 2017. Our business is now showing some really good momentum, especially in the B2B markets. You guys saw the results of some pretty some operational execution this quarter with our free cash flow margins up pretty significantly. So, we appreciate you guys calling in. And we’ll look to talk to you soon. Thanks. Happy Thanksgiving. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.

Operator Good morning, and welcome to the Analog Devices First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I'd like to now introduce your host for today's call Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining the Analog Device's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You can find our press release, relating financial schedules and the CFO commentary at investor.analog.com. With me on today's call are ADI's CEO, Vincent Roche; and ADI's CFO, Dave Zinsner. So before we start, let's get through some disclosures. Please note the information we're about to discuss including our objectives, outlook and the proposed acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. With the exception of revenue, our commentary about ADI's first quarter financial results will exclude special items which, in the aggregate, totaled $85 million for the quarter. When comparing our first quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also excluded from the prior quarter and year-over-year results, and reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in Schedules E and F in today's earnings release which we have posted at investor.analog.com. So with that, let's get started and I'll turn the call over to Vince. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks very much, Ali, and good morning, everyone. So by any measure, our January quarter results were stellar. Revenue of $984 million was well above the high-end of our guidance, growing 28% over the prior year, and we had broad strength across all our markets. And we expanded operating margins over 700 basis points from the prior year to 35% of sales. Earnings per share of $0.94 was up 68% from the prior year, and $0.16 better than the high-end of our guidance. Importantly, we have generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months. So this was a terrific start to the fiscal year and we continue to see momentum in our business and in our customer engagements. Our R&D efforts are squarely focused on the most exciting trends in the industrial, automotive, communications infrastructure, healthcare and consumer markets. And I'd like to give you just a few examples of where ADI's technology is making a real difference. So in the area of data converters, which are in many ways the backbone of our mixed-signal franchise, for example, where we're the market leader, we've once again established new performance benchmarks with our next generation of high-speed ADCs and DACs that exploit 28 nanometer CMOS technology combined with proprietary architectures and algorithms. By providing four times improvement in critical high dynamic range parameters, these converter platforms are enabling the next wave of gigahertz bandwidth, software defined systems for 4G and 5G communications, for test equipment and also in several aerospace and defense applications. It's the radio or radar equivalent of going from watching television using the old bunny ears to watching high-definition TV. We can now give our customers the ability to see things that they did not know were even there, and this is a real game-changer. In addition, our previously introduced high-speed signal processing platforms achieved record revenue based on our integrated transceiver platforms, which helped our communications infrastructure customers and beyond efficiently address the challenges of accelerating global data consumption. These solutions are equally well-suited to and are increasingly finding their way into a diversity of applications in the industrial instrumentation, aerospace and defense, and indeed the automotive markets. In factory automation, our software configurable input/output solutions are enabling our customers to create flexible and agile platforms that can be readily expanded and reconfigured to support more sensing and control channels on automated factory floors. In addition, in motor control and robotics applications, our measurement, control and isolation products are driving improvements in motor efficiency, precision and reliability, while maintaining the highest levels of safety and industrial robustness. ADI's healthcare solutions span both B2B and consumer applications. On the B2B side, we're enabling higher channel counts and throughput in high-performance imaging systems that lower our customers' overall cost per channel but importantly drive higher ADI content per system. And on the consumer side of healthcare, our vital signs monitoring technology is enabling highly accurate and ultra-low-power measurements of critical health parameters, improving personal wellness and overall quality of life for the end consumer. Healthcare for ADI is now a high-growth business with its annualized growth rate running in the double digits. In automotive, our 77 gigahertz RF CMOS radar solution offers a robust platform for ADAS and autonomous driving, giving customers the ability to capture objects earlier, more reliably and with greater precision, and over much longer distances. And our investments in cost-effective, high-performing silicon-based LIDAR solutions are turbocharging our efforts in this area. These are the types of innovations that ADI is bringing to the market to better serve our customers' needs, and our industry and the market is taking notice indeed. In recognition of our overall innovation efforts, ADI received the 2017 IEEE Innovation Award and was once again selected by Thomson Reuters as one of the 100 most innovative companies in the world. It has been said that innovation distinguishes between a leader and a follower, and ADI is very much at the cutting edge of innovation. This value forms the bedrock of our company's culture and belief system, and is shared equally by Linear Technology. So with that, let me give you a brief update on the status of the proposed acquisition of LTC. Thus far, we have received six out of seven regulatory approvals needed to close the transaction, and our integration planning teams have been hard at work to combine the best of both ADI and Linear Tech in order to present one face to the customer on day one. I also am delighted that Bob Swanson, the Founder and Chief – the Executive Chairman of Linear Tech plans to join ADI's board after the deal closes. So we're all very excited about the combination of ADI and Linear Tech, which we believe will create an analog industry powerhouse that will accelerate innovation and revenue growth opportunities in our core markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure markets, which indeed are the most lucrative markets in our industry. The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to ADI's non-GAAP earnings per share and free cash flow. And it makes ADI the number one or number two player in all the major analog product categories, enabling us to solve our customers' analog system problems from end to end. So overall, this was a remarkable quarter across multiple dimensions and we see the momentum continuing into the second quarter. So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ali for some more details on our performance by end market in the quarter just passed. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Thanks, Vince. So just digging deeper in our results by end market, the industrial market was 41% of revenue. It increased 1% sequentially, which was really very strong in what's typically a much seasonal and slower first quarter compared to the fourth. We didn't really see much of a slowdown over the holidays, and I'd say January order rates were also very strong. Within the industrial business, industrial instrumentation applications outperformed our expectations, and I'll highlight the ATE market as one that was particularly strong. And also the factory automation sector within industrial had a very good quarter. Compared to the prior year, the industrial market showed considerable strength. It grew 15% and really was broad-based strength across all of the industrial sectors, so that's a very good result. On the automotive side, the automotive market at 14% of sales was also better than seasonal. It decreased really only slightly from the prior quarter, but grew a very strong 10% over the prior year, led by really content-rich applications such as infotainment, powertrain and ADAS. On the communications infrastructure side, revenue there in that market was 18% of sales. Again, it was also ahead of expectations, increased slightly sequentially, and was up 4% over the prior year, led by optical networking. The consumer market was 27% of sales in the first quarter. It decreased 8% sequentially, which was much better than seasonality, as we saw continued strength in portable consumer applications. And consumer more than doubled over the prior year in the first quarter. So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave for details of our financial performance in the first quarter and our guidance for next quarter. With the exception of revenue, Dave's comments on the P&L line items are on a non-GAAP basis. So, Dave, it's all yours. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ali. Fiscal 2017 starts out on solid footing, with ADI delivering very strong revenue, profitability, earnings per share and free cash flow. Revenue in the first quarter, as we mentioned, totaled $984 million, and diluted earnings per share was $0.94. Gross margins at 66.1% were above our guidance on a better mix of business and higher revenues. Inventory, on a dollars basis, decreased $11 million sequentially and days of inventory were within our model range at 101 days, down from 105 days in the prior quarter. Utilization rates in the first quarter were in the high 60s and we're planning to increase utilization to the mid-70s in the second quarter. Weeks of inventory in distribution were lean at approximately seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we recorded a $49 million restructuring charge primarily related to a voluntary early retirement program for certain U.S. employees. Excluding this and other special items, operating expenses increased 7% sequentially, with the entirety of the increase tied to our variable compensation program, which is based on year-over-year revenue growth and operating margin metrics. Nevertheless, operating margins at 35% of sales expanded over 700 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth and prudent expense management by the team. Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $26 million. The result of a partial quarter with the permanent financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place, we expect our net interest expense to be approximately $30 million per quarter until we close the Linear Tech acquisition. Our first quarter tax rate was approximately 8%, which we expect will be our tax rate until we close, again, on the acquisition. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share increased 68% over the prior year to $0.94, as I said. The first quarter was also a strong free cash flow quarter. We generated $286 million in free cash flow, which was an increase of 46% over the prior year. And over the past 12 months, ADI has grown free cash flow 20% to $1.2 billion or 34% of sales. Capital additions in the first quarter totaled $28 million, and we're planning for the capital additions in 2017 to be in the range of $130 million to $145 million. In line with our shareholder value creation strategy, our Board of Directors approved a 7% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.45 per share, which represents an annual dividend increase to $1.80 per share. Now turning to our outlook and expectations for the second quarter of 2017, which, with the exception of revenue expectations, is on a non-GAAP basis and excludes known special items that are outlined in today's release. After a record-setting first quarter revenue performance, which was also well above the high end of our guidance range, we're planning for the B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, in the aggregate, to grow in the mid to high digits sequentially in the second quarter and to increase in the high single-digits over the prior year. In consumer, we're expecting that normal seasonal patterns will prevail and that this business will likely decrease between 40% and 50% sequentially. Nevertheless, we expect consumer to be up significantly over the prior year in the second quarter. In the aggregate, we're planning for revenue in the second quarter to be in the range of $870 million to $950 million, which at the midpoint represents year-over-year revenue growth of 17% and would represent the fourth consecutive quarter of year-on-year revenue growth. Gross margins are expected to increase to be between approximately 66.5% and approximately 67% on higher utilization rates and a more favorable mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be down approximately 3% to up approximately 1% sequentially in the second quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding any special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $0.74 to $0.86, which at the midpoint would represent very strong year-over-year earnings per share growth of about 25%. So to wrap it up, the first quarter was a very good start to the year. We had a strong year-on-year revenue growth with quality earnings and cash generation, and we expect this momentum to continue into the second quarter. So with that, we'll take any questions you have. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Thanks, Dave. And so just a reminder for folks on the line, please limit yourself to one question. And again, if you have a follow-up question, we ask that you re-queue. And again, we do this in the spirit of fairness so that everybody on the call gets to ask at least one of their questions. So, operator, it's all yours. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting ask a question. Congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Guys, relative to your initial guidance, the big upside in the Jan quarter came out of consumer. Just kind of curious what changed throughout the quarter? Was this really just kind of a better mix with your large consumer customer where that would give you more content on a larger screen? And as you think about kind of the opportunity of that customer, how do we think about content going into the back half of this calendar year? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. So, yeah, I would say that in general, with the consumer customer, sometimes it's hard to totally predict kind of the weekly shipment level through the entire quarter, and so we make an estimate based on what we think will turn through the quarter plus what we come into the quarter with backlog. And there's varying scenarios, I would say, related to how that would go, and this was obviously the most optimistic scenario. So it just turned out better. I would point out though that we didn't expect nearly the strength we saw in the B2B markets either, and so they contributed to the upside as well. So we're really happy that every end market did a bit better than expectation. So that was awesome. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. So just to add to what Dave has said there, John, we, as you know, have been working hard to diversify our position and decrease dependence on any single socket. And we have more content in these applications today than we had this time last year, so that certainly helps as well. So we've got more ASP per system, and we continue on the track of diversifying to get more and more sockets in that area. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right, John. Thanks for the question. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. It looks like you announced a new distribution agreement overnight. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And maybe this is an opportunity to just talk about the strategy in disty going forward. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we've had a three decade relationship with the distribution – maybe 25 years with the distribution channel in general. And what we're striving to do, Tore, fundamentally, is we're trying to deepen the level of support and give a better breadth of service for our customers, we have many tens of thousands of customers. So the channel plays an important role, I think, in the broad breadth of logistics, services across the entire suite of customers and, particularly, with the smaller customers, providing a lot of design service. So basically, we've decided to simplify the structure to enable us to bring the level of support that we desire. And we expect basically to be able to leverage the more focused channel team that we've got and essentially draw on a more comprehensive suite of, in a more focused way, end to end support services that could range from design, design help, also prototyping and of course logistics support over the long term. So we're also – we've been investing for all our customers, big and small, over the last several years, by bringing on more direct resource and really understanding the role of the channel. So we're in a good place right now. And of course, when we combine with LTC, we will also have the opportunity to bring more field applications and sales resource to a broader breadth of customers. So overall it's about – it's part of our fundamental strategy which is about innovation, diversity and operation efficiency, and the moves we're making here play to all three of those facets of our business model. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Tore. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next caller? Operator Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thank you very much. Thanks for the update on Linear, Vince. And, Dave, last quarter you had given us an update on the accretion and the tax rate. Now that you've spent quite a fair bit of time in rainy California, I was just wondering how should we think about the top line? And where I was going with this was, at CES, we had some early view on how a go-to-market would look like on a board with Linear and with ADI in a auto (20:26) example. So question is really when should we be expecting it to show up and in what end market should it show up first? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I would say we get more and more enthusiastic about the opportunities for combining technologies of Linear and ADI every time we meet together as a team. We have kind of loosely built in some expectation that we will get several hundred million dollars worth of revenue synergies with the combined business. Some of that will take some time. I think a lot of it's going to be in areas where the design cycles and the time to revenue is quite long. So it might be out in the 2024, 2025 timeframe where you really start to see us hit our stride. But within the first few years, we'll start to hit and see some revenue synergies and I would point out, that's kind of similar to the path we're on right now with Hittite. We're starting to see it trickle in a little bit in the early stages. We certainly have seen it build up in the opportunity pipeline for the subsequent years here. So we just get, I think, every time we meet, more optimistic about what we can do as a company in terms of delivering technology. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Most of the business of LT and ADI combined is targeted at the core markets of B2B, so we see opportunity. I think at CES you saw how ADAS, for example, combines the power technology of LTC with the mixed-signal technology and RF technology of ADI. But we have examples of that in the industrial automation, the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense. So basically, everywhere we play, including communications infrastructure where ADI is much stronger on the wireless side, LT is stronger on the wired side. There's good symbiosis between the companies, particularly in the B2B space. And I think the first couple of years of the combination of ADI and LTC are really about how well together we take the pipeline of opportunity that's at unprecedented levels in terms of size at this point in time and convert that pipeline and service the heck out of our customers. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'd also point out that just on the expense side, as we've had time to solidify the plans there, I think we feel very, very confident about our $150 million expense synergy. I talked about this kind of restructuring charge we took this quarter related to this voluntary retirement. Part of that is to kind of make some room as we integrate the Linear Tech people within the company. So in the 10-Q, it talks about a $28 million savings for just the salary and fringe related to those employees. But we find that there's some extraneous savings like travel and so forth that also are reduced. So I think we have made a pretty meaningful down payment on the $150 million already in advance of even integrating and then, of course, the public company expenses go away pretty quickly too, and that's $20 million, $25 million of expense. So we are very confident now having worked on this and really penciled it out that the $150 million is very achievable. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, guys. Good luck. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ambrish. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. Dave, you piqued my interest on the Hittite revenue synergy side. Can you give a little bit more detail or anecdotes in terms of some of the things you're seeing from a design or revenue ramp perspective on Hittite? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, Vince will probably do a better job of this. But I would tell you that in areas like aerospace and defense where they were particularly strong, we have pulled a lot of ADI content onto those systems and subsystems. That's been a big win for us. I think we did not appreciate how much opportunity we had in the aerospace and defense area until we really acquired Hittite and had that opportunity. There's a lot of radar capability that's required for the automotive space and we're taking a lot of the capability we got from Hittite to be able to drive into that. The next generation which we've talked about in the past is 77 GHz for ADAS, and I think a lot of the capability that we've pulled in from Hittite has helped in that regard. Also, I think that Hittite really just didn't have an opportunity to really address the larger OEMs given their size. Around the edges, they might have won a little bit of business but they really weren't breaking into those OEMs in any meaningful way. That's all changed since they became part of ADI, and these are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million opportunities if you do them right. So I think we estimate that we probably have filled in the pipeline to the tune of $100 million of opportunities because of having the two entities combined that we would not have won otherwise. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we were running, at the time of acquisition of Hittite, which was just about two and a half years ago now, the revenue stream was roughly $70 million a quarter. So we're running on a percentage basis at a substantially higher level than that right now. And I think to add to what Dave has said, the conversation with our customers has changed over that period of time. I think Hittite and ADI have gone from being very potent component-level suppliers to really now being able to architect our customer systems in these new, for example, digitally-oriented beam steering systems for radar, for mobile communications infrastructure. We're very much now working at the application level in rather than the component level out. So I think it's been really a win-win. And as our customers in the analog space in general are dealing with thinner and thinner levels of resource and capability in terms of engineering their analog solutions, we're very, very well positioned. Hittite helps enormously on the RF and microwave side of things, and LT will help us on the analog systems side with the power side of things primarily. So that's I think how to look at it. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Considering the upside in the January quarter and then the guidance for the April quarter, what should we be thinking about conceptually for seasonal revenue growth in the July quarter? And then maybe give us your expectations, if only relative, for the four basic food groups of end markets for revenue growth this year. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, seasonally, usually sequentially, the third quarter is up. You tend to see a stronger consumer environment and the rest of the markets either are up or flattish. And then the fourth quarter, generally, is sequentially up again pretty meaningfully because you really start to see the consumer hit. I'd almost say in this case, we love all our children equally. I mean, I think every end market has the opportunity to grow meaningfully from the prior year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year kind of shakes out, but we start off in a great situation. Our expectations for the second quarter as we look at our backlog, look really good. So this continues into the third and fourth quarter, I think every end market is going to do pretty well for us. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Chris. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Hi. Thank you. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Question on the consumer side. It's clearly been better than your expectations. Could you just talk about how do you think about the segment over the next 12 months in terms of portables versus the rest of the consumer opportunity you have? And I think this gen (29:03) with your largest customer, you had talked about picking up 30% more content. Do you think that's possible again as they go through, I guess, a super-cycle product for the next year or do you see opportunity with your largest customer more in sync with the unit trajectory they have? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, our consumer business is really a tale of two stories. We have prosumer, which is a more – it's a business more akin to a B2B type dynamic. So with many customers, many, many very high performance building blocks from DSP to mixed-signal in areas like audio and video signal processing. So we saw some downturn of that business over the last couple of years, but we've kind of hit the bottom. We believe we're at an inflection point there. So that's at least giving us stability. And that's kind of the bedrock of our consumer business in many ways. And so we're at an inflection there. On the portable side of things, we're clearly in a much better position than we were a year ago. We're working hard, as I said earlier, to diversify to get more sockets and things like the image processing control system, sensing in general. And also, we're engaging with many more customers than we did, I should say, on a pretty constrained, highly-leveraged R&D budget. So look, is it possible that we get another 30% increase? Of course it is, and that's what we're working hard to do, to make sure we grab all available high-quality sockets that our technology is well matched to. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC You're welcome. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the segment dynamics, and first, just looking at industrial and communications. Industrial looks like it's at record revenues, at least in my model, and it seems like there should still be some incremental strength that would come from areas like energy extraction, which I suspect may not be as strong as it's been in the past. And on communications, the business has been barely stable for the last four quarters. Is the strength that you're seeing now leading to a more material increase versus trailing fourth quarter levels or are we really just seeing a seasonal bump and nothing more than that? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Let me take a shot at it. I'm sure Vince will provide better color than I can give. But I would say you're right in that the industrial business, I think, did hit a record this quarter, which is interesting and the fact that it happened in a first quarter, which tends not to be the strongest industrial quarter for us. So we'll likely hit an even bigger record next quarter in the second quarter, since we expect it to be sequentially up. I think it had kind of a relatively pedestrian last year and maybe not as strong as we would've liked to see it. There was a few things on the macro side that impacted it. I think those have abated, and when you look at every subcategory within the industrial space, all of them are showing good strength. So I think that while it's early and we're always cautious about this, it does look like it's moving into a period of time where we start to see some meaningful growth. And quite honestly we should. We've made a lot of investments in the market, and there are a lot of opportunities for analog content. And so I think we're starting to see the benefits of a lot of development over a lot of years. On the communications side, that business had been up. It came back down quite a bit in the prior periods. It had somewhat stabilized in the back half of last year, and we're in kind of what I think is a relatively stable period. Having said that, I do think there's a lot of opportunity in the comm infrastructure space for us. We have this new transceiver – integrated transceiver that I think is doing quite well. I think we will see our performance on the wireless side be relatively better on the macro side than some of the competition. On top of that, we think that this small cell deployment that has been long advertised and late to the party seems to have really started to gain some momentum here. And so we do expect to see some real traction in 2017 from that. And then lastly, an area that tends not to get as much focus is our wireline business. And with this kind of 100G deployments – 100 gig deployments that are going on right now, we're benefiting from that. And so our wireline business actually did particularly well this quarter. And so I think there's some expectation that for the next – rest of the year it will do quite well. So I don' know exactly how the year will totally shake out yet, we always lack a bit of visibility out beyond the quarter. But I think the fact that it was pretty solid in the first quarter and we're expecting a reasonably good second quarter leads us to believe it'll be a pretty good year for the comms business. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, something we don't talk an awful lot about in our wired business as well is cable infrastructure. And a lot of our new mixed-signal and data converter technologies are enabling the carriers there to realize 4K/8K video. And without our technology, it is impossible, and to be able to do it within constrained physical space as well as power budgets. So that's an area that's doing very, very well for ADI in the signal path along with, as Dave said, in the optical control chain. So I think our wired business is poised – as long as the markets behave well, our wireline business is poised for, I think, very decent growth in the years ahead. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. You mentioned you've got six of the seven clearances you need for the Linear deal. Can you remind us which the six are and what the seventh is you're waiting on, and update of when you expect the deal to close? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'll butcher the six, so let me just tell you the one that we don't have. We certainly have the U.S. We have all the Europe ones. We have all of Asia except for one, which is China. So we're waiting for China to approve it. I think it's well documented that that's a long process, which is why we expected this thing to close around the end of April is because we knew that that would be a long process. It's going very well. They do ask for a lot of information, and we have to go back and pull the stuff together, present it in a way that is in the format in which they want to see it. And so we think it's going fine, and we would expect that we are on schedule to close this by the end of April at this point. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Great. Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, David. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch My question is, Vince, on the automotive segment. It's very good to see the sales acceleration over the last couple of quarters despite, I know in the past, you've had some headwind in some products. But when I look at some of your analog peers, say Texas Instruments, they grew their auto business by 20% last year. So my question is when do you think those legacy headwinds will start to abate and you can close the growth gap with some of your peer group? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're – better and better positions with our customers and across the various applications. But just for the record, our infotainment business grew in double digits over the past year, as did much of our powertrain and battery control technologies as well. So some of our segments have performed well in the double digit area. I think we've talked before very openly about the fact that we've withdrawn from parts of the MEMS-based safety market, but we still have an important role to play particularly with very, very high-end inertial and gyro-sensing technologies for active safety control. And our ADAS technology continues – the RF and microwave technology there continues to do very, very well, and we're very excited by the 77-gig technology that we're bringing to market as well that we showcased at CES. And that's a whole new level of performance that we're bringing to market there with 77-gig. So I think we're better and better positioned. We're doing a lot more business in Asia than we used to do. And so that kind of evens out the distribution or the diversity of our business across the globe. So those are the facts and we continue to invest heavily in the space because we think it is a growth driver for many, many years to come for ADI. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I would tell you that Linear Tech's technology in the battery management system is quite good, and they have seen growth probably in excess of 20% probably in certain years. So I think that we bring that into the fold, that certainly will help just organically drive the growth, but also we should get some pretty good synergies. Where they have good customer traction is in places where we don't, and vice versa. So I think we'll be able to pull each other into customers and engagements that we don't have today. So it should be, I think, a really good growth driver for us going forward. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Vivek. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter in the guide and then also a little bit longer term, I was surprised in the January quarter that it was as strong as it was given that the consumer side was so strong. So I would have thought mix, all else being equal, would have been a little bit of headwind. And then the inverse, I thought, would've been true in the April quarter where the combination of mix being a tailwind and you just said utilization was going to rise, I thought that might actually lead to a little more upside. So that's kind of the near-term part of the question, if you could give details on that. And then the longer-term one, if we just put Linear and ADI's gross margins together, talk about the deltas above and below that, synergy values, anything else you can capture that makes it more than just one plus one. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So let's start with this quarter. Well, I would say that if you remember through all of last year, 2016, we kept utilization relatively in check and really worked the inventories down because we really wanted to get the days down below 110 days, and we did achieve that by the end of the year. So like normally coming into the first quarter, we're not as well positioned in terms of inventory levels. And so we end up having to bring utilization down pretty meaningfully in the first quarter, and that didn't happen. So that ended up kind of helping the gross margins. On top of that, the industrial business just did really well through the whole quarter, and so there was really hardly any reason to kind of crank down the fabs in any meaningful way. The mix part, it actually did impact us a little but I would tell you that, that particular piece of business actually has pretty good gross margins, comparatively speaking, relative to other consumer companies out there. And so it's not quite the headwind when we get it and it's not quite the tailwind when it goes away that you might expect. It might impact it 20 basis points or something. For the second quarter, as you point out, we should have a little bit better mix and we are bringing up the utilization, although kind of modestly, we'll probably be in kind of the mid-70s. There's obviously – if the mix goes where the consumer kind of comes down as meaningfully as I said, 40% to 50%, and we do get to the kind of mid-70s kind of gross margins, it's possible that we would be at the really high end of that range. And we'd be up to the 67% range. So that's obviously a scenario. I think we're just hedging ourselves a little bit just in case we can't quite crank the utilization up to those levels, because it does require us to – well, we have the equipped capacity. We still have to crank through the wafers and sometimes that takes a little while to get cranking. Okay. Oh, on the longer-term side. Yeah, Ross, sorry about that. So then I think on a blended basis, we're kind of in the high 60s gross margins just kind of out of the gate. And then about $50 million of the near-term synergies that we're expecting will be in the gross margin line. So we should expect to get into the 70% range pretty easily, I think, with the near-term synergies identified. Honestly, I think longer-term we have the potential to get into low the 70s for gross margins. We will get some – we inherit some processes from Linear Technology that I think are quite strong. I think that will help out in the entire business. I think we will, over time, get more and more efficient in terms of our manufacturing spending. And so I think that will be beneficial to the gross margin line as well. And of course, I think as Vince had talked a lot about, we are really focused in this B2B space and just quite honestly, because of the design cycles and the technology required to deliver what those customers want, it just carries better gross margins. And so I think we will benefit from that as well. So we're optimistic we can get the gross margins into the low 70s. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ross. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good morning, and congratulations on the solid execution. On the aerospace and defense, obviously, that drives very good diversification within your business. Fundamentals here appear to be fairly solid. I think there're some pretty large radar, some sat com programs that are firing both in defense and in the commercial sectors. I know you guys talked a little bit about the synergies from Hittite, but just wondering in general, how is the A&D sub-segment tracking, growth-wise, on a year-over-year basis relative to the sort of 10% to 15% growth trend in the industrial segment now? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so I'll just take the last question first. So it's been growing, obviously, at a very healthy clip over the last year or two in kind of the high single digits. I'd say in this quarter, it was probably in kind of the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest the question was what, exactly? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC How do you guys see this business going for the full year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Oh. Oh, for the full year this year? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Probably in that range. I think this is kind of a multiple of GDP kind of growth. It'll be very correlated to how GDP grows. So probably mid to high single digits. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thanks a lot. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the results. I just wanted to follow up on a question. The B2B business is growing high single digits. If you take out comm, it's more like double digits. You've seen a lot of your analog peers see similar, and it's really a function of the kind of really no seasonality and then kind of growing off that base. Just give us your perspective on the broader markets here as you talk to customers. Why is this market tracking at these double digits? And how do you see that affecting seasonality as you go through the year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I'll talk macro and then I'm sure Vince talks to all of these customers, so he can probably give you some more specific color. But I think last year, it didn't grow that much, and so part of it is just rebounding off of a much slower environment in 2016. So I don't think it's altogether surprising that we would see it start to come back. I would tell you though that I think we have – earlier in the period in which people have been focusing on this, back in the 2009, maybe even 2008, before I even got here timeframe, we really did focus our R&D efforts largely in this space. And I think we made it fairly public that we moved a lot of our consumer R&D into the B2B space to really focus on that market and particularly the industrial markets. And so eventually all that development does translate into revenue, as promised. And so I think some of what you're seeing in the results this quarter is that, it's the opportunities starting to translate into revenue more than anything. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, also, while America and Europe are very, very important, they're the bedrock, if you like, of our B2B business, we've been particularly pleased on the industrial side with the growth in our business in Asia as well over the last two or three quarters. So it's broad based and strong in Europe and America, but even stronger on a growth basis in Asia at this point in time. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The one thing that helps us get some confidence around this – I don't want to oversell it just yet because one quarter doesn't make a pattern – but as you look out in terms of the inventory, particularly using disties as a proxy, it's actually fairly lean at seven weeks. In fact we normally run seven and a half to eight weeks. And for the last, I don't know, maybe four or five quarters, we've been down at this seven-week level and we haven't seen a build. So that's good because that's getting consumed in various regions, particularly in Asia. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Also, if you look at the PMIs of the big CapEx spending economies, they've been strong and strengthening over the last several quarters. So that certainly helps the B2B business. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Great. Thanks, Blayne. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next question. Operator And your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, especially on the strength in industrial in the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. I had a question about the Linear Tech pending acquisition, and it relates to the biggest concern I hear from investors, which is that there's a view that there are significant cultural differences between the two companies. I'm wondering what you've learned as you've built the plan to integrate the two businesses about the differences and similarities culture-wise and what you see as the biggest risks and biggest opportunities now that you're presumably quite far along in that integration planning. Thank you. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yes. So good question. I would say that something I'm very, very clear about is that what we stand for as companies around the notion that innovation drives business success, that we drive diversity. Diversity gives us tremendous resilience in the markets that we choose, lots of customers, lots of products, lots of different applications. And also we're companies that focus really on getting great free cash flows from our business through operational efficiency, good price management. So those things we share together. Those are kind of the core business values that underpin both companies. So I would say, clearly there are differences in the way we achieve our goals in terms of the behaviors in the companies, the routines to get the results that we get. And our approach to trying to create something better than the sum of the parts really is to leverage the best of both cultures. And that means basically pooling our business and operating processes together, and we're working hard to figure out what is the best of both on the side of manufacturing supply chain. Obviously, day one it's critical that we have a single voice to the customer, so we're working very, very hard on that. Also, from an ongoing technology and customer management, manufacturing standpoint, pooling our collective knowledge and wisdom and where we're combining the leadership structures, we're going to start combining the organizations to enable us to achieve those goals. And we're also looking for ways to get the blood of both companies flowing in each other's veins through cross-pollination, through physical co-location as best we can. And I think what will be very, very clear is that our measurement and reward system will emphasize what we both care about, which is long-term, profitable growth. So that's essentially how we're approaching things. And I would say I'm very impressed with how both companies are leaning into each other and how we're working to truly try to get the best of both. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, if there's anything we're concerned about, which was one part of your question, I would say we were so enthusiastic about this on both sides and now we've got to wait for all this bureaucracy to kind of take care of itself. So we're a bit anxious to get going and it's just painful to wait as long as we've had to wait to get it done. But I think as soon as it closes, we will be off to the races in terms of making the sum of the parts – or making the combination more than the sum of the parts. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Will, thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about your recently acquired LIDAR business. I was hoping you could talk about how its current position stacks up against the competition and how big of a revenue opportunity you think this could be over the next few years. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so, I mean, at an application level, to be able to realize these future semi-autonomous and autonomous driving systems, you need lots of different types of eyes out there – they're looking for the signal, so to speak. So today, radar and camera, the image processing from cameras, they're the important modalities, but LIDAR is becoming a very important modality. And today, that's realized with mechanical systems essentially. Our approach is to – so we acquired Vescent Photonics, which enables us to bring a more silicon-based technology to bear, which is fundamentally – it's inherently more mechanically robust and enables us to apply a level of signal processing to the core sensing and actuation technology to get the kind of resolution and the kind of reliability and performance that we need to get. So I think it'll be a very important part of the realization of these autonomous driving systems. In fact, I believe that semiconductor process technologies will enable this type of technology to become more broadly deployed. So that's I think the way to look at it. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC Thanks, guys, for taking my questions, and congratulations. Vince, you've talked about the underlying health of global GDP trends. I guess I'm just curious where you see yourself gaining share in some of the sub applications in B2B versus maybe that underlying market support? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so if you take core Industrial, I mentioned the fact that we were very pleased with our performance in Asia. I think that's been the result of many, many, many years of customer engagement, good deployment of R&D, and that's working well for us. So I think a certain amount – a rising tide will lift all boats, so a certain amount of what we're seeing is driven by what's happening in the macroeconomy, but another part of it is driven by what we are doing to position ourselves to take advantage of these markets as they strengthen. So I'm particularly pleased with industrial, particularly in the automation sector. Dave has talked about A&D and how important Hittite has been to that part of our story. Instrumentation, ATE had a good quarter last one as well. So we're well positioned with high margin, high value, high performance products in that area. Automotive we've talked a lot about, and the foundation of our B2B business is industrial and healthcare. And both of those areas are performing well, driven by our innovation efforts, our customer engagement efforts and the cooperation of the markets David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I think there is a belief by us that the industrial markets are going through a change much like the automotive market is already experiencing, this electrification of cars. There is more and more kind of sensor, signal processing, these kind of IoT-like applications going into the industrial space. So the unit volume of the end product, whatever that might be, a robotics system or whatever, may be still the same number of units, but the amount of analog content and semiconductor content, broadly, within those systems is just increasing as they try to sense these things in richer ways, get better data out of them. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. To that point, our customers are becoming more and more and more software-oriented, which opens up a tremendous opportunity for us as a leader in the application of analog technology. So the dependence on ADI is increasing where we are essentially, if you like, filling the vacuum for our customers and providing a lot of the analog engineering solutions to these customers. And as they become more software-oriented in areas like – I mentioned during the prepared remarks here that we have solved a very, very important problem for our customers, where we can take many, many different types of inputs and outputs across various standards where we've been able to do a level of integration in these universal input/output systems, which enable our customers to leverage their software across a bigger swath of analog input/output technology. So that's some of the stuff that's going as we move towards smarter, more software-oriented machines and process automation and factory automation, for example. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC All right. Thank you, and congrats. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Yes. Thank you. So I had a question about the B2B outlook for the April quarter. So I thought industrial is typically up 10-plus percent in April, and I think you guys have said that auto's not too dissimilar. So the fact that you're guiding B2B up mid to high single digits with all the momentum that you're seeing today would sort of suggest that you've got some room to do better. So am I mischaracterizing seasonality? Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so it's more a function of when you're coming off such strong numbers in the first quarter, you're probably not going to have quite the sequential improvement in the second quarter. I think it still drives year-over-year growth that's pretty meaningful, so I don't think there's anything really to read into that other than just the growth off of a very strong first quarter drives it to be a little bit lighter, I think, seasonally. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. And remember, we're at record levels in our industrial business. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Right. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Next question. Operator And your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, can you share on the OpEx side, you did a great job of managing OpEx in a flat revenue environment in fiscal 2016, curious now that revenues appear to be tracking low double digits at least, how we should think about OpEx. And then secondly, now that business is tracking better, free cash flow's coming in stronger, and before you talked about net leverage of 3.8 times at deal close, I would imagine that number would look better. Would love to get an update from you on that. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So on the OpEx front, we're obviously going to lag the revenue growth. Probably we'll outgrow it (59:49) at half the rate, maybe we do a little bit better. Of course all this is prior to the Linear Tech integration, and then we'll probably operate in a similar modality after that. As it relates to the net leverage, we'll probably be a little bit better coming in. Partially we also have accumulated a lot of cash in the last couple of quarters and we expect to have a pretty good quarter next quarter for cash flow. So I would suspect that we will come in a little bit under what we originally anticipated. I think maybe more importantly is we think the free cash flow is going to be quite strong in this combined business going forward. And so I think we will end up seeing a little bit more rapid paydown of the debt than we originally anticipated. And so in that respect, we should see some benefit on the interest expense line over time, and that certainly will benefit earnings as well. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Next question. Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just the follow-up on a question on industry conditions and obviously, demand appears pretty favorable now that inventory's low. Do you see any evidence, either within your own business or the industry, of tightening supply conditions? Anything that you think would incentivize the customers and distributors to start bringing the inventory levels a bit higher here? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. No, I think when you look across the supply chain as far as we can tell, when we look at our inventory levels in distribution, they're really at the low end of where we would expect them to be. When you look at the lead times, and we have a goal here of delivering product within four to six weeks, and we're still delivering basically the entirety of our orders within the stated lead times. So I think you always have little pockets here and there but I'd say, overall, things look pretty good. So next question. Operator Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also had a follow-up on inventories. You guys mentioned the relatively lean level of seven weeks that the distribution channels were running at. But I was wondering for your direct customers' sales, which is I think about half of your business, can you talk about how the visibility on those inventories look? And also related to it, going back to the distribution channel, I think traditionally, people look at disty channel inventory as a good sort of real-time or lead indicator of how the overall cycle is doing further downstream. But just with the better kind of just-in-time manufacturing methods and ERP systems, do you guys still think that a lower kind of in-line inventory level in the disty channel is still a good sort of a lead indicator? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The answer to the second is yes. It's a decent indicator, although at the end of the day, it's the customer's inventory level of the distributors that really matters. We don't have tons of visibility into that. We look at the same data you do, which is what they report in terms of their overall inventory levels, which includes our products but also includes a whole bunch of other suppliers into those customers. And they look in the range of pretty healthy levels. So I think that at least as we see it today, that doesn't seem to be anything that would lead you to believe there's an inventory issue out there. I think really how we do and how the industry does is more based on how the macro does and how world GDP does over the course of the next few years. I'd say that's a bigger determinant of how things go. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. All right. So next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Richard Sewell - Stephens, Inc. Guys, this is Richard in for Harsh. Just wanted to touch on the small cell commentary you had. I know that this has been kind of a well-advertised, but it continues to kind of get pushed out. What's giving you confidence that this is picking up? What are you hearing from customers? And then how does your content look compared to your traditional wireless infrastructure market? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're getting orders, so that's how we know that the small cell is starting to deploy. It's more than just commentary. This is actually, we're getting physical orders and forecasts. So I think we feel pretty confident, unless some – there was some end demand perturbation or something like that. The content is good. It's reasonably similar to what we see on the macro side on a per-radio basis. The difference is that a macro base station could have 16... Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. A lot more (01:04:33) channels. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. 24 channels, and there's only one channel usually for one small cell. So the idea there is that there'll just be a whole lot more of them deployed in a given region or given area, and that's where we – we make it up in volume. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the ramp up of small cell is really beginning to happen now. But I think it'll hit a different pace over the next year or two years. So it'll be a bigger factor in two or three years' time, but our business is still pretty much dominated by macro cell right now. But as Dave said, the channel ASP, the per-channel ASP is about the same, whether it's a small cell or a macro small. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, and I'd just add, as Vince mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a record quarter this quarter in our software defined integrated transceiver platforms. And actually, a lot of that was driven by these small cell deployments there are taking place, I'd say particularly in China right now. Okay. Looks like we've got one more caller and then we'll close it down. Operator Our final question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah, thanks. I just had one last follow-up and this is on automotive. So instead of looking at sort of the relative growth rates the last year, is there a way for you to talk about dollar content, especially with the Linear acquisition? So what I'm trying to get is, perhaps, maybe now, the content is sort of in the tens of dollars, but then with all these new technologies, you'll eventually be in the hundreds of dollars. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, the LT, again, look, we have a huge range of ASPs per car given the type of technology we deploy and how much of it gets deployed per car. LT, so we have – ADI's business is spread across basically gas-driven cars, combustion engines as well as EV and hybrid. LT's is largely electric and hybrid. So it gives us greater diversity, but it depends very much on the type of car, the brand of car. So it's very, very hard to put a number on it, Tore, but it certainly – we get more diversification, more ASP, on average, virtually in every car that we supply technology to. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I would say we did like a quick back of the napkin on it. And I think on a low end, we would get somewhere in the $55 range per car; and on the high end, we could do as well as $500. But if we add Linear to the mix, they should add about $100 worth of content, at least from a SAM perspective. Now obviously, we don't win all that business at every car, but – so it's quite strong. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. All right, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. That's very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. For sure. Okay. Great call, great quarter. Hopefully, we'll talk to you guys on the road. That was definitely our last question. Thanks for joining the call this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon. Vincent T.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting ask a question. Congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Guys, relative to your initial guidance, the big upside in the Jan quarter came out of consumer. Just kind of curious what changed throughout the quarter? Was this really just kind of a better mix with your large consumer customer where that would give you more content on a larger screen? And as you think about kind of the opportunity of that customer, how do we think about content going into the back half of this calendar year? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. So, yeah, I would say that in general, with the consumer customer, sometimes it's hard to totally predict kind of the weekly shipment level through the entire quarter, and so we make an estimate based on what we think will turn through the quarter plus what we come into the quarter with backlog. And there's varying scenarios, I would say, related to how that would go, and this was obviously the most optimistic scenario. So it just turned out better. I would point out though that we didn't expect nearly the strength we saw in the B2B markets either, and so they contributed to the upside as well. So we're really happy that every end market did a bit better than expectation. So that was awesome. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. So just to add to what Dave has said there, John, we, as you know, have been working hard to diversify our position and decrease dependence on any single socket. And we have more content in these applications today than we had this time last year, so that certainly helps as well. So we've got more ASP per system, and we continue on the track of diversifying to get more and more sockets in that area. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right, John. Thanks for the question. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. It looks like you announced a new distribution agreement overnight. Could you maybe elaborate a little bit on that? And maybe this is an opportunity to just talk about the strategy in disty going forward. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we've had a three decade relationship with the distribution – maybe 25 years with the distribution channel in general. And what we're striving to do, Tore, fundamentally, is we're trying to deepen the level of support and give a better breadth of service for our customers, we have many tens of thousands of customers. So the channel plays an important role, I think, in the broad breadth of logistics, services across the entire suite of customers and, particularly, with the smaller customers, providing a lot of design service. So basically, we've decided to simplify the structure to enable us to bring the level of support that we desire. And we expect basically to be able to leverage the more focused channel team that we've got and essentially draw on a more comprehensive suite of, in a more focused way, end to end support services that could range from design, design help, also prototyping and of course logistics support over the long term. So we're also – we've been investing for all our customers, big and small, over the last several years, by bringing on more direct resource and really understanding the role of the channel. So we're in a good place right now. And of course, when we combine with LTC, we will also have the opportunity to bring more field applications and sales resource to a broader breadth of customers. So overall it's about – it's part of our fundamental strategy which is about innovation, diversity and operation efficiency, and the moves we're making here play to all three of those facets of our business model. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Tore. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next caller? Operator Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thank you very much. Thanks for the update on Linear, Vince. And, Dave, last quarter you had given us an update on the accretion and the tax rate. Now that you've spent quite a fair bit of time in rainy California, I was just wondering how should we think about the top line? And where I was going with this was, at CES, we had some early view on how a go-to-market would look like on a board with Linear and with ADI in a auto (20:26) example. So question is really when should we be expecting it to show up and in what end market should it show up first? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I would say we get more and more enthusiastic about the opportunities for combining technologies of Linear and ADI every time we meet together as a team. We have kind of loosely built in some expectation that we will get several hundred million dollars worth of revenue synergies with the combined business. Some of that will take some time. I think a lot of it's going to be in areas where the design cycles and the time to revenue is quite long. So it might be out in the 2024, 2025 timeframe where you really start to see us hit our stride. But within the first few years, we'll start to hit and see some revenue synergies and I would point out, that's kind of similar to the path we're on right now with Hittite. We're starting to see it trickle in a little bit in the early stages. We certainly have seen it build up in the opportunity pipeline for the subsequent years here. So we just get, I think, every time we meet, more optimistic about what we can do as a company in terms of delivering technology. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Most of the business of LT and ADI combined is targeted at the core markets of B2B, so we see opportunity. I think at CES you saw how ADAS, for example, combines the power technology of LTC with the mixed-signal technology and RF technology of ADI. But we have examples of that in the industrial automation, the instrumentation, the aerospace and defense. So basically, everywhere we play, including communications infrastructure where ADI is much stronger on the wireless side, LT is stronger on the wired side. There's good symbiosis between the companies, particularly in the B2B space. And I think the first couple of years of the combination of ADI and LTC are really about how well together we take the pipeline of opportunity that's at unprecedented levels in terms of size at this point in time and convert that pipeline and service the heck out of our customers. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'd also point out that just on the expense side, as we've had time to solidify the plans there, I think we feel very, very confident about our $150 million expense synergy. I talked about this kind of restructuring charge we took this quarter related to this voluntary retirement. Part of that is to kind of make some room as we integrate the Linear Tech people within the company. So in the 10-Q, it talks about a $28 million savings for just the salary and fringe related to those employees. But we find that there's some extraneous savings like travel and so forth that also are reduced. So I think we have made a pretty meaningful down payment on the $150 million already in advance of even integrating and then, of course, the public company expenses go away pretty quickly too, and that's $20 million, $25 million of expense. So we are very confident now having worked on this and really penciled it out that the $150 million is very achievable. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you, guys. Good luck. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ambrish. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. Dave, you piqued my interest on the Hittite revenue synergy side. Can you give a little bit more detail or anecdotes in terms of some of the things you're seeing from a design or revenue ramp perspective on Hittite? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, Vince will probably do a better job of this. But I would tell you that in areas like aerospace and defense where they were particularly strong, we have pulled a lot of ADI content onto those systems and subsystems. That's been a big win for us. I think we did not appreciate how much opportunity we had in the aerospace and defense area until we really acquired Hittite and had that opportunity. There's a lot of radar capability that's required for the automotive space and we're taking a lot of the capability we got from Hittite to be able to drive into that. The next generation which we've talked about in the past is 77 GHz for ADAS, and I think a lot of the capability that we've pulled in from Hittite has helped in that regard. Also, I think that Hittite really just didn't have an opportunity to really address the larger OEMs given their size. Around the edges, they might have won a little bit of business but they really weren't breaking into those OEMs in any meaningful way. That's all changed since they became part of ADI, and these are $10 million, $20 million, $30 million opportunities if you do them right. So I think we estimate that we probably have filled in the pipeline to the tune of $100 million of opportunities because of having the two entities combined that we would not have won otherwise. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so we were running, at the time of acquisition of Hittite, which was just about two and a half years ago now, the revenue stream was roughly $70 million a quarter. So we're running on a percentage basis at a substantially higher level than that right now. And I think to add to what Dave has said, the conversation with our customers has changed over that period of time. I think Hittite and ADI have gone from being very potent component-level suppliers to really now being able to architect our customer systems in these new, for example, digitally-oriented beam steering systems for radar, for mobile communications infrastructure. We're very much now working at the application level in rather than the component level out. So I think it's been really a win-win. And as our customers in the analog space in general are dealing with thinner and thinner levels of resource and capability in terms of engineering their analog solutions, we're very, very well positioned. Hittite helps enormously on the RF and microwave side of things, and LT will help us on the analog systems side with the power side of things primarily. So that's I think how to look at it. Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Considering the upside in the January quarter and then the guidance for the April quarter, what should we be thinking about conceptually for seasonal revenue growth in the July quarter? And then maybe give us your expectations, if only relative, for the four basic food groups of end markets for revenue growth this year. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, seasonally, usually sequentially, the third quarter is up. You tend to see a stronger consumer environment and the rest of the markets either are up or flattish. And then the fourth quarter, generally, is sequentially up again pretty meaningfully because you really start to see the consumer hit. I'd almost say in this case, we love all our children equally. I mean, I think every end market has the opportunity to grow meaningfully from the prior year. We'll have to see how the rest of the year kind of shakes out, but we start off in a great situation. Our expectations for the second quarter as we look at our backlog, look really good. So this continues into the third and fourth quarter, I think every end market is going to do pretty well for us. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Chris. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks. Good morning, guys, and congrats on the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Hi. Thank you. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Question on the consumer side. It's clearly been better than your expectations. Could you just talk about how do you think about the segment over the next 12 months in terms of portables versus the rest of the consumer opportunity you have? And I think this gen (29:03) with your largest customer, you had talked about picking up 30% more content. Do you think that's possible again as they go through, I guess, a super-cycle product for the next year or do you see opportunity with your largest customer more in sync with the unit trajectory they have? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, our consumer business is really a tale of two stories. We have prosumer, which is a more – it's a business more akin to a B2B type dynamic. So with many customers, many, many very high performance building blocks from DSP to mixed-signal in areas like audio and video signal processing. So we saw some downturn of that business over the last couple of years, but we've kind of hit the bottom. We believe we're at an inflection point there. So that's at least giving us stability. And that's kind of the bedrock of our consumer business in many ways. And so we're at an inflection there. On the portable side of things, we're clearly in a much better position than we were a year ago. We're working hard, as I said earlier, to diversify to get more sockets and things like the image processing control system, sensing in general. And also, we're engaging with many more customers than we did, I should say, on a pretty constrained, highly-leveraged R&D budget. So look, is it possible that we get another 30% increase? Of course it is, and that's what we're working hard to do, to make sure we grab all available high-quality sockets that our technology is well matched to. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on the strong results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley & Co. LLC You're welcome. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the segment dynamics, and first, just looking at industrial and communications. Industrial looks like it's at record revenues, at least in my model, and it seems like there should still be some incremental strength that would come from areas like energy extraction, which I suspect may not be as strong as it's been in the past. And on communications, the business has been barely stable for the last four quarters. Is the strength that you're seeing now leading to a more material increase versus trailing fourth quarter levels or are we really just seeing a seasonal bump and nothing more than that? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Let me take a shot at it. I'm sure Vince will provide better color than I can give. But I would say you're right in that the industrial business, I think, did hit a record this quarter, which is interesting and the fact that it happened in a first quarter, which tends not to be the strongest industrial quarter for us. So we'll likely hit an even bigger record next quarter in the second quarter, since we expect it to be sequentially up. I think it had kind of a relatively pedestrian last year and maybe not as strong as we would've liked to see it. There was a few things on the macro side that impacted it. I think those have abated, and when you look at every subcategory within the industrial space, all of them are showing good strength. So I think that while it's early and we're always cautious about this, it does look like it's moving into a period of time where we start to see some meaningful growth. And quite honestly we should. We've made a lot of investments in the market, and there are a lot of opportunities for analog content. And so I think we're starting to see the benefits of a lot of development over a lot of years. On the communications side, that business had been up. It came back down quite a bit in the prior periods. It had somewhat stabilized in the back half of last year, and we're in kind of what I think is a relatively stable period. Having said that, I do think there's a lot of opportunity in the comm infrastructure space for us. We have this new transceiver – integrated transceiver that I think is doing quite well. I think we will see our performance on the wireless side be relatively better on the macro side than some of the competition. On top of that, we think that this small cell deployment that has been long advertised and late to the party seems to have really started to gain some momentum here. And so we do expect to see some real traction in 2017 from that. And then lastly, an area that tends not to get as much focus is our wireline business. And with this kind of 100G deployments – 100 gig deployments that are going on right now, we're benefiting from that. And so our wireline business actually did particularly well this quarter. And so I think there's some expectation that for the next – rest of the year it will do quite well. So I don' know exactly how the year will totally shake out yet, we always lack a bit of visibility out beyond the quarter. But I think the fact that it was pretty solid in the first quarter and we're expecting a reasonably good second quarter leads us to believe it'll be a pretty good year for the comms business. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, something we don't talk an awful lot about in our wired business as well is cable infrastructure. And a lot of our new mixed-signal and data converter technologies are enabling the carriers there to realize 4K/8K video. And without our technology, it is impossible, and to be able to do it within constrained physical space as well as power budgets. So that's an area that's doing very, very well for ADI in the signal path along with, as Dave said, in the optical control chain. So I think our wired business is poised – as long as the markets behave well, our wireline business is poised for, I think, very decent growth in the years ahead. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Craig. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. You mentioned you've got six of the seven clearances you need for the Linear deal. Can you remind us which the six are and what the seventh is you're waiting on, and update of when you expect the deal to close? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I'll butcher the six, so let me just tell you the one that we don't have. We certainly have the U.S. We have all the Europe ones. We have all of Asia except for one, which is China. So we're waiting for China to approve it. I think it's well documented that that's a long process, which is why we expected this thing to close around the end of April is because we knew that that would be a long process. It's going very well. They do ask for a lot of information, and we have to go back and pull the stuff together, present it in a way that is in the format in which they want to see it. And so we think it's going fine, and we would expect that we are on schedule to close this by the end of April at this point. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Great. Thanks. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, David. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations on the great results. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch My question is, Vince, on the automotive segment. It's very good to see the sales acceleration over the last couple of quarters despite, I know in the past, you've had some headwind in some products. But when I look at some of your analog peers, say Texas Instruments, they grew their auto business by 20% last year. So my question is when do you think those legacy headwinds will start to abate and you can close the growth gap with some of your peer group? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're – better and better positions with our customers and across the various applications. But just for the record, our infotainment business grew in double digits over the past year, as did much of our powertrain and battery control technologies as well. So some of our segments have performed well in the double digit area. I think we've talked before very openly about the fact that we've withdrawn from parts of the MEMS-based safety market, but we still have an important role to play particularly with very, very high-end inertial and gyro-sensing technologies for active safety control. And our ADAS technology continues – the RF and microwave technology there continues to do very, very well, and we're very excited by the 77-gig technology that we're bringing to market as well that we showcased at CES. And that's a whole new level of performance that we're bringing to market there with 77-gig. So I think we're better and better positioned. We're doing a lot more business in Asia than we used to do. And so that kind of evens out the distribution or the diversity of our business across the globe. So those are the facts and we continue to invest heavily in the space because we think it is a growth driver for many, many years to come for ADI. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I would tell you that Linear Tech's technology in the battery management system is quite good, and they have seen growth probably in excess of 20% probably in certain years. So I think that we bring that into the fold, that certainly will help just organically drive the growth, but also we should get some pretty good synergies. Where they have good customer traction is in places where we don't, and vice versa. So I think we'll be able to pull each other into customers and engagements that we don't have today. So it should be, I think, a really good growth driver for us going forward. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks, Vivek. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross C. Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congrats on the results. I wanted to ask a question about gross margins. In the quarter in the guide and then also a little bit longer term, I was surprised in the January quarter that it was as strong as it was given that the consumer side was so strong. So I would have thought mix, all else being equal, would have been a little bit of headwind. And then the inverse, I thought, would've been true in the April quarter where the combination of mix being a tailwind and you just said utilization was going to rise, I thought that might actually lead to a little more upside. So that's kind of the near-term part of the question, if you could give details on that. And then the longer-term one, if we just put Linear and ADI's gross margins together, talk about the deltas above and below that, synergy values, anything else you can capture that makes it more than just one plus one. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So let's start with this quarter. Well, I would say that if you remember through all of last year, 2016, we kept utilization relatively in check and really worked the inventories down because we really wanted to get the days down below 110 days, and we did achieve that by the end of the year. So like normally coming into the first quarter, we're not as well positioned in terms of inventory levels. And so we end up having to bring utilization down pretty meaningfully in the first quarter, and that didn't happen. So that ended up kind of helping the gross margins. On top of that, the industrial business just did really well through the whole quarter, and so there was really hardly any reason to kind of crank down the fabs in any meaningful way. The mix part, it actually did impact us a little but I would tell you that, that particular piece of business actually has pretty good gross margins, comparatively speaking, relative to other consumer companies out there. And so it's not quite the headwind when we get it and it's not quite the tailwind when it goes away that you might expect. It might impact it 20 basis points or something. For the second quarter, as you point out, we should have a little bit better mix and we are bringing up the utilization, although kind of modestly, we'll probably be in kind of the mid-70s. There's obviously – if the mix goes where the consumer kind of comes down as meaningfully as I said, 40% to 50%, and we do get to the kind of mid-70s kind of gross margins, it's possible that we would be at the really high end of that range. And we'd be up to the 67% range. So that's obviously a scenario. I think we're just hedging ourselves a little bit just in case we can't quite crank the utilization up to those levels, because it does require us to – well, we have the equipped capacity. We still have to crank through the wafers and sometimes that takes a little while to get cranking. Okay. Oh, on the longer-term side. Yeah, Ross, sorry about that. So then I think on a blended basis, we're kind of in the high 60s gross margins just kind of out of the gate. And then about $50 million of the near-term synergies that we're expecting will be in the gross margin line. So we should expect to get into the 70% range pretty easily, I think, with the near-term synergies identified. Honestly, I think longer-term we have the potential to get into low the 70s for gross margins. We will get some – we inherit some processes from Linear Technology that I think are quite strong. I think that will help out in the entire business. I think we will, over time, get more and more efficient in terms of our manufacturing spending. And so I think that will be beneficial to the gross margin line as well. And of course, I think as Vince had talked a lot about, we are really focused in this B2B space and just quite honestly, because of the design cycles and the technology required to deliver what those customers want, it just carries better gross margins. And so I think we will benefit from that as well. So we're optimistic we can get the gross margins into the low 70s. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Thanks, Ross. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good morning, and congratulations on the solid execution. On the aerospace and defense, obviously, that drives very good diversification within your business. Fundamentals here appear to be fairly solid. I think there're some pretty large radar, some sat com programs that are firing both in defense and in the commercial sectors. I know you guys talked a little bit about the synergies from Hittite, but just wondering in general, how is the A&D sub-segment tracking, growth-wise, on a year-over-year basis relative to the sort of 10% to 15% growth trend in the industrial segment now? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so I'll just take the last question first. So it's been growing, obviously, at a very healthy clip over the last year or two in kind of the high single digits. I'd say in this quarter, it was probably in kind of the mid to high single digits on a year-over-year basis. And then the rest the question was what, exactly? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC How do you guys see this business going for the full year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Oh. Oh, for the full year this year? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Probably in that range. I think this is kind of a multiple of GDP kind of growth. It'll be very correlated to how GDP grows. So probably mid to high single digits. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Thanks a lot. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Sure. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and I'll echo the congrats on the results. I just wanted to follow up on a question. The B2B business is growing high single digits. If you take out comm, it's more like double digits. You've seen a lot of your analog peers see similar, and it's really a function of the kind of really no seasonality and then kind of growing off that base. Just give us your perspective on the broader markets here as you talk to customers. Why is this market tracking at these double digits? And how do you see that affecting seasonality as you go through the year? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, I'll talk macro and then I'm sure Vince talks to all of these customers, so he can probably give you some more specific color. But I think last year, it didn't grow that much, and so part of it is just rebounding off of a much slower environment in 2016. So I don't think it's altogether surprising that we would see it start to come back. I would tell you though that I think we have – earlier in the period in which people have been focusing on this, back in the 2009, maybe even 2008, before I even got here timeframe, we really did focus our R&D efforts largely in this space. And I think we made it fairly public that we moved a lot of our consumer R&D into the B2B space to really focus on that market and particularly the industrial markets. And so eventually all that development does translate into revenue, as promised. And so I think some of what you're seeing in the results this quarter is that, it's the opportunities starting to translate into revenue more than anything. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, also, while America and Europe are very, very important, they're the bedrock, if you like, of our B2B business, we've been particularly pleased on the industrial side with the growth in our business in Asia as well over the last two or three quarters. So it's broad based and strong in Europe and America, but even stronger on a growth basis in Asia at this point in time. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The one thing that helps us get some confidence around this – I don't want to oversell it just yet because one quarter doesn't make a pattern – but as you look out in terms of the inventory, particularly using disties as a proxy, it's actually fairly lean at seven weeks. In fact we normally run seven and a half to eight weeks. And for the last, I don't know, maybe four or five quarters, we've been down at this seven-week level and we haven't seen a build. So that's good because that's getting consumed in various regions, particularly in Asia. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Also, if you look at the PMIs of the big CapEx spending economies, they've been strong and strengthening over the last several quarters. So that certainly helps the B2B business. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Great. Thanks, Blayne. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Next question. Operator And your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats, especially on the strength in industrial in the quarter. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. William Stein - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. I had a question about the Linear Tech pending acquisition, and it relates to the biggest concern I hear from investors, which is that there's a view that there are significant cultural differences between the two companies. I'm wondering what you've learned as you've built the plan to integrate the two businesses about the differences and similarities culture-wise and what you see as the biggest risks and biggest opportunities now that you're presumably quite far along in that integration planning. Thank you. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yes. So good question. I would say that something I'm very, very clear about is that what we stand for as companies around the notion that innovation drives business success, that we drive diversity. Diversity gives us tremendous resilience in the markets that we choose, lots of customers, lots of products, lots of different applications. And also we're companies that focus really on getting great free cash flows from our business through operational efficiency, good price management. So those things we share together. Those are kind of the core business values that underpin both companies. So I would say, clearly there are differences in the way we achieve our goals in terms of the behaviors in the companies, the routines to get the results that we get. And our approach to trying to create something better than the sum of the parts really is to leverage the best of both cultures. And that means basically pooling our business and operating processes together, and we're working hard to figure out what is the best of both on the side of manufacturing supply chain. Obviously, day one it's critical that we have a single voice to the customer, so we're working very, very hard on that. Also, from an ongoing technology and customer management, manufacturing standpoint, pooling our collective knowledge and wisdom and where we're combining the leadership structures, we're going to start combining the organizations to enable us to achieve those goals. And we're also looking for ways to get the blood of both companies flowing in each other's veins through cross-pollination, through physical co-location as best we can. And I think what will be very, very clear is that our measurement and reward system will emphasize what we both care about, which is long-term, profitable growth. So that's essentially how we're approaching things. And I would say I'm very impressed with how both companies are leaning into each other and how we're working to truly try to get the best of both. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, if there's anything we're concerned about, which was one part of your question, I would say we were so enthusiastic about this on both sides and now we've got to wait for all this bureaucracy to kind of take care of itself. So we're a bit anxious to get going and it's just painful to wait as long as we've had to wait to get it done. But I think as soon as it closes, we will be off to the races in terms of making the sum of the parts – or making the combination more than the sum of the parts. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Will, thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Steve Smigie with Raymond James. Vincent Celentano - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks. This is Vince Celentano on for Steve. I had a question about your recently acquired LIDAR business. I was hoping you could talk about how its current position stacks up against the competition and how big of a revenue opportunity you think this could be over the next few years. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so, I mean, at an application level, to be able to realize these future semi-autonomous and autonomous driving systems, you need lots of different types of eyes out there – they're looking for the signal, so to speak. So today, radar and camera, the image processing from cameras, they're the important modalities, but LIDAR is becoming a very important modality. And today, that's realized with mechanical systems essentially. Our approach is to – so we acquired Vescent Photonics, which enables us to bring a more silicon-based technology to bear, which is fundamentally – it's inherently more mechanically robust and enables us to apply a level of signal processing to the core sensing and actuation technology to get the kind of resolution and the kind of reliability and performance that we need to get. So I think it'll be a very important part of the realization of these autonomous driving systems. In fact, I believe that semiconductor process technologies will enable this type of technology to become more broadly deployed. So that's I think the way to look at it. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Thanks. Next question. Operator Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Drexel Hamilton. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC Thanks, guys, for taking my questions, and congratulations. Vince, you've talked about the underlying health of global GDP trends. I guess I'm just curious where you see yourself gaining share in some of the sub applications in B2B versus maybe that underlying market support? Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so if you take core Industrial, I mentioned the fact that we were very pleased with our performance in Asia. I think that's been the result of many, many, many years of customer engagement, good deployment of R&D, and that's working well for us. So I think a certain amount – a rising tide will lift all boats, so a certain amount of what we're seeing is driven by what's happening in the macroeconomy, but another part of it is driven by what we are doing to position ourselves to take advantage of these markets as they strengthen. So I'm particularly pleased with industrial, particularly in the automation sector. Dave has talked about A&D and how important Hittite has been to that part of our story. Instrumentation, ATE had a good quarter last one as well. So we're well positioned with high margin, high value, high performance products in that area. Automotive we've talked a lot about, and the foundation of our B2B business is industrial and healthcare. And both of those areas are performing well, driven by our innovation efforts, our customer engagement efforts and the cooperation of the markets David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. And I think there is a belief by us that the industrial markets are going through a change much like the automotive market is already experiencing, this electrification of cars. There is more and more kind of sensor, signal processing, these kind of IoT-like applications going into the industrial space. So the unit volume of the end product, whatever that might be, a robotics system or whatever, may be still the same number of units, but the amount of analog content and semiconductor content, broadly, within those systems is just increasing as they try to sense these things in richer ways, get better data out of them. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. To that point, our customers are becoming more and more and more software-oriented, which opens up a tremendous opportunity for us as a leader in the application of analog technology. So the dependence on ADI is increasing where we are essentially, if you like, filling the vacuum for our customers and providing a lot of the analog engineering solutions to these customers. And as they become more software-oriented in areas like – I mentioned during the prepared remarks here that we have solved a very, very important problem for our customers, where we can take many, many different types of inputs and outputs across various standards where we've been able to do a level of integration in these universal input/output systems, which enable our customers to leverage their software across a bigger swath of analog input/output technology. So that's some of the stuff that's going as we move towards smarter, more software-oriented machines and process automation and factory automation, for example. Cody Acree - Drexel Hamilton LLC All right. Thank you, and congrats. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Romit Shah with Nomura. Romit Shah - Nomura Securities International, Inc. Yes. Thank you. So I had a question about the B2B outlook for the April quarter. So I thought industrial is typically up 10-plus percent in April, and I think you guys have said that auto's not too dissimilar. So the fact that you're guiding B2B up mid to high single digits with all the momentum that you're seeing today would sort of suggest that you've got some room to do better. So am I mischaracterizing seasonality? Could you just talk about that a little bit? Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, so it's more a function of when you're coming off such strong numbers in the first quarter, you're probably not going to have quite the sequential improvement in the second quarter. I think it still drives year-over-year growth that's pretty meaningful, so I don't think there's anything really to read into that other than just the growth off of a very strong first quarter drives it to be a little bit lighter, I think, seasonally. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. And remember, we're at record levels in our industrial business. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Right. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. Next question. Operator And your next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yeah, good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. I guess two quick questions. The first one, can you share on the OpEx side, you did a great job of managing OpEx in a flat revenue environment in fiscal 2016, curious now that revenues appear to be tracking low double digits at least, how we should think about OpEx. And then secondly, now that business is tracking better, free cash flow's coming in stronger, and before you talked about net leverage of 3.8 times at deal close, I would imagine that number would look better. Would love to get an update from you on that. Thank you. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Okay. So on the OpEx front, we're obviously going to lag the revenue growth. Probably we'll outgrow it (59:49) at half the rate, maybe we do a little bit better. Of course all this is prior to the Linear Tech integration, and then we'll probably operate in a similar modality after that. As it relates to the net leverage, we'll probably be a little bit better coming in. Partially we also have accumulated a lot of cash in the last couple of quarters and we expect to have a pretty good quarter next quarter for cash flow. So I would suspect that we will come in a little bit under what we originally anticipated. I think maybe more importantly is we think the free cash flow is going to be quite strong in this combined business going forward. And so I think we will end up seeing a little bit more rapid paydown of the debt than we originally anticipated. And so in that respect, we should see some benefit on the interest expense line over time, and that certainly will benefit earnings as well. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. Next question. Thanks. Operator Your next question is from Chris Caso with CLSA. Christopher Caso - CLSA Americas LLC Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Just the follow-up on a question on industry conditions and obviously, demand appears pretty favorable now that inventory's low. Do you see any evidence, either within your own business or the industry, of tightening supply conditions? Anything that you think would incentivize the customers and distributors to start bringing the inventory levels a bit higher here? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. No, I think when you look across the supply chain as far as we can tell, when we look at our inventory levels in distribution, they're really at the low end of where we would expect them to be. When you look at the lead times, and we have a goal here of delivering product within four to six weeks, and we're still delivering basically the entirety of our orders within the stated lead times. So I think you always have little pockets here and there but I'd say, overall, things look pretty good. So next question. Operator Your next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS. Stephen Chin - UBS Securities LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I also had a follow-up on inventories. You guys mentioned the relatively lean level of seven weeks that the distribution channels were running at. But I was wondering for your direct customers' sales, which is I think about half of your business, can you talk about how the visibility on those inventories look? And also related to it, going back to the distribution channel, I think traditionally, people look at disty channel inventory as a good sort of real-time or lead indicator of how the overall cycle is doing further downstream. But just with the better kind of just-in-time manufacturing methods and ERP systems, do you guys still think that a lower kind of in-line inventory level in the disty channel is still a good sort of a lead indicator? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. The answer to the second is yes. It's a decent indicator, although at the end of the day, it's the customer's inventory level of the distributors that really matters. We don't have tons of visibility into that. We look at the same data you do, which is what they report in terms of their overall inventory levels, which includes our products but also includes a whole bunch of other suppliers into those customers. And they look in the range of pretty healthy levels. So I think that at least as we see it today, that doesn't seem to be anything that would lead you to believe there's an inventory issue out there. I think really how we do and how the industry does is more based on how the macro does and how world GDP does over the course of the next few years. I'd say that's a bigger determinant of how things go. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. All right. So next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Stephens. Richard Sewell - Stephens, Inc. Guys, this is Richard in for Harsh. Just wanted to touch on the small cell commentary you had. I know that this has been kind of a well-advertised, but it continues to kind of get pushed out. What's giving you confidence that this is picking up? What are you hearing from customers? And then how does your content look compared to your traditional wireless infrastructure market? David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, we're getting orders, so that's how we know that the small cell is starting to deploy. It's more than just commentary. This is actually, we're getting physical orders and forecasts. So I think we feel pretty confident, unless some – there was some end demand perturbation or something like that. The content is good. It's reasonably similar to what we see on the macro side on a per-radio basis. The difference is that a macro base station could have 16... Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. A lot more (01:04:33) channels. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. 24 channels, and there's only one channel usually for one small cell. So the idea there is that there'll just be a whole lot more of them deployed in a given region or given area, and that's where we – we make it up in volume. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah. I'd say the ramp up of small cell is really beginning to happen now. But I think it'll hit a different pace over the next year or two years. So it'll be a bigger factor in two or three years' time, but our business is still pretty much dominated by macro cell right now. But as Dave said, the channel ASP, the per-channel ASP is about the same, whether it's a small cell or a macro small. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Yeah, and I'd just add, as Vince mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did have a record quarter this quarter in our software defined integrated transceiver platforms. And actually, a lot of that was driven by these small cell deployments there are taking place, I'd say particularly in China right now. Okay. Looks like we've got one more caller and then we'll close it down. Operator Our final question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yeah, thanks. I just had one last follow-up and this is on automotive. So instead of looking at sort of the relative growth rates the last year, is there a way for you to talk about dollar content, especially with the Linear acquisition? So what I'm trying to get is, perhaps, maybe now, the content is sort of in the tens of dollars, but then with all these new technologies, you'll eventually be in the hundreds of dollars. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Well, the LT, again, look, we have a huge range of ASPs per car given the type of technology we deploy and how much of it gets deployed per car. LT, so we have – ADI's business is spread across basically gas-driven cars, combustion engines as well as EV and hybrid. LT's is largely electric and hybrid. So it gives us greater diversity, but it depends very much on the type of car, the brand of car. So it's very, very hard to put a number on it, Tore, but it certainly – we get more diversification, more ASP, on average, virtually in every car that we supply technology to. David A. Zinsner - Analog Devices, Inc. I would say we did like a quick back of the napkin on it. And I think on a low end, we would get somewhere in the $55 range per car; and on the high end, we could do as well as $500. But if we add Linear to the mix, they should add about $100 worth of content, at least from a SAM perspective. Now obviously, we don't win all that business at every car, but – so it's quite strong. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. Great. All right, Tore. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. That's very helpful. Thank you. Ali Husain - Analog Devices, Inc. All right. For sure. Okay. Great call, great quarter. Hopefully, we'll talk to you guys on the road. That was definitely our last question. Thanks for joining the call this morning, and we'll talk to you again soon. Vincent T. Roche - Analog Devices, Inc. Thank you. Operator This concludes today's Analog Devices conference call. You may now disconnect.

Muse - Evercore Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley Tore Svanberg - Stifel William Stein - SunTrust Chris Danely - Citigroup Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets Craig Ellis - B. Riley Tristan Gerra - Baird Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Operator Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I’d like to now introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain Alright. Good morning and thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. So let’s get through our disclosures. Note the information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our commentary about ADI’s second quarter financial results, are adjusted for special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also adjusted in the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today’s earnings release and on our web schedules which we have posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. As many of you know, we have completed the Linear Tech acquisition about halfway through our fiscal second quarter. And so we have included reconciliations in our Investor page that provide a greater level of detail into our standalone and combined results for the quarter. But at a high level, I will say that Linear contributed $208 million to our non-GAAP second quarter revenue. This number includes $60 million of purchase accounting adjustments that were made for U.S. GAAP purposes and relate to Linear Tech inventory that was in the distribution channel in North America and Japan when we closed the acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, there remains an additional $30 million of Linear inventory in the distribution channel, which we expect will be sold in its entirety in the third quarter. We have included this adjustment in our non-GAAP revenue expectations for the third quarter and no such adjustments are anticipated starting in the fourth quarter. And then the last point I will make and its information you should be mindful of is that the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter. Okay. So, with all that behind us, about to get the show on the road, I will turn it over to ADI’s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince’s comments on the second quarter are for standalone ADI unless he specifies otherwise. And our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter relates to the combined company. Okay. Vince, all yours. Vincent Roche Thank you very much, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Well, it’s been a very busy period for ADI and I am pleased to share our results with you. Not only were our second quarter financial results stellar, but we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech in March and our integration work is going very well. So, let’s start with our financial results for the second quarter. ADI’s standalone revenue came in at $1 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 28% increase over the prior year. These results were above our revised guidance on broad-based strength and we continue to see signs of a good business environment, particularly in the industrial market. Gross margins expended to 67.6%, which was above the high end of our guidance and the combination of higher sales, higher gross margins and tight control over operating expenses helped to expand operating margins to a robust 36% of sales. In addition, free cash flow margins, as a combined company, were also strong at 39% of revenue in the second quarter. As Ali mentioned, Linear Tech was part of ADI for about half the quarter and contributed $208 million in sales on a non-GAAP basis. And we are looking forward to a full quarter’s contribution in our third quarter. Now, let me give you some details of our performance by end market during the quarter and note that my remarks relate only to standalone ADI. The industrial markets at 46% of sales grew 15% sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and continued its year-over-year growth trajectory, increasing 20% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was broad-based across all industrial sectors and indeed regions. While business conditions are certainly more positive than they were at this point last year, our success is also the result of smart R&D investments across diverse industrial applications within factory automation, instrumentation, aerospace and defense and healthcare. Over several decades, ADI has carved as a leadership position in high performance signal processing, serving our tens of thousands of industrial customers where applications demand the highest levels of performance both in terms of signal chain and in terms of power optimization. In the near-term, our industrial customers are excited to gain access to the highly complementary portfolios of ADI and Linear Tech and are even more excited at the future of value creation opportunities made possible by our combination. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the second quarter and grew 8% sequentially and 9% over the prior year. Both sequential and year-over-year growth was broad-based across all automotive application areas and was strongest in safety and ADAS applications, while powertrain revenue increased, but at a slower pace. We supply thousands of products into dozens of automotive sub-applications and are gaining more dollar content as we further automate and electrify. The combination with LT dramatically strengthens our technology offerings in this market and expands additional dollar content opportunities across our very complementary customer base. The communications infrastructure market, at 18% of sales, grew 5% sequentially and 4% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth in this market was led by wireless infrastructure applications where we are making very good progress with our RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing and integrated transceiver solutions. While we are, of course, only in the very early stages of 5G cellular infrastructure deployment, we believe that our optimized radio signal processing and power management solutions will be a very key driver of growth as channel counts increase and customers moved to phase their antennas to make the most efficient use of available spectrum with the highest reliability and performance. Of course, the wireless infrastructure market is one where Linear largely didn’t play and thus this market represents an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in the medium term. On a year-over-year basis, communications infrastructure growth was led by the wireline sector where ADI’s customers are benefiting from our position clocking, timing and control technologies in the 100-gig and beyond optical networking applications. And finally, consumer market revenues at 21% of sales decreased 24% sequentially as prosumer applications revenue increased and portable applications revenue came in better than planned. Compared to the prior year, both prosumer and portable applications revenue increased. So while our combined financial results were excellent, our near and long-term outlooks are equally bright. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech, creating the high-performance analog market leader. As we said from the beginning, we are taking a best of both approach combining the best from ADI and LTC to come up with a new operating system to drive long-term profitable growth for our combined company and I am very pleased with the progress we have already made. We are optimizing processes across our selling, new product development, manufacturing and operations activities. On the sales side, the integration of our two sales forces has brought with it a tremendous degree of excitement and we have already identified many sales synergy opportunities. On the engineering side, our teams have come together at remarkable speed and have begun identifying product roadmap combinations that we expect over the long-term will accelerate our growth. On the manufacturing side, our teams have been focused on ensuring that we meet the upside demand and continue to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. Overall, our $150 million cost synergy target within 18 months of the acquisition is firmly on track. To give you some background, during the integration planning phase, the vast majority of actions needed to realize the synergy target were identified. And while many of the related actions have already been taken, we are only in the early stages of seeing the benefits of those synergies in our P&L. In addition we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion in our first full quarter as a combined company to be 15% and we expect earnings accretion to accelerate into fiscal 2018 as we begin to more fully realize the synergies from the transaction. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. Ali Husain Great. Thanks Vince. Good morning everybody. Since the acquisition of Linear Tech occurred about half way through our second quarter, Linear Tech’s contributions to ADI’s results were limited to approximately seven weeks and my prepared remarks will exclude Linear’s results and other special items unless I specify otherwise. Note that a schedule reconciling our standalone and combined performance can be found in our Investor page at investor.analog.com and a reconciliation of our combined GAAP performance to our combined non-GAAP performance can be found in schedules E and F of today’s earnings release. So revenue in the second quarter increased to $1 billion growing 2% sequentially and 28% over the prior year and was above our revised guidance. Sequential revenue growth was led by our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, which in the aggregate grew 11% sequentially and importantly 14% over the prior year. Gross margins in the second quarter were 67.6%, up 150 basis points from the 66.1% we achieved in the prior quarter, primarily the result of higher utilization rates. Days of inventory increased 3 days to 104 days and dollars of inventory increased $12 million sequentially as we increased production to match strong demand. Deferred revenue for shipments in the distribution increased 6% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were at seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expense of $318 million increased 4% sequentially due to the natural lift from higher activity in the second quarter and as compared to the first and higher variable compensation in the second quarter as our bonus program responded a better year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit in the quarter. As a result, operating margins of 36% of sales expanded 500 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth, higher gross margins and prudent expense management by the team. So now for P&L line items below the operating margin line, I will talk to results on a combined company basis, excluding special items, outlined in today’s release. Other expense in the second quarter was $59 million, the result of a partial quarter with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million per quarter thereafter. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 10% and that’s the rate we expect for the remaining two quarters of the year. We are also planning for a non-GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 15%, so note that will be higher than the 10% rate this year. Our diluted share count increased in the quarter due to the equity consideration related to the acquisition. Since this is a weighted average calculation, the diluted share count in 2Q increased to 346 million shares and we expect diluted share count in the third quarter, which will be our first full quarter as a combined company to be approximately 375 million shares. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.03. The second quarter was also a very strong free cash flow quarter. As a combined company, we generated $475 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And for the reported trailing 12 months, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which translates to free cash flow margins of 37%. Now this level of free cash flow generation is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it reflects the strength of our business model and our brand. Second, it means that our EBITDA generation was also very strong. And this means that we are better positioned from a leverage ratio standpoint at the current time than we had – than we have communicated to you earlier. So as a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio based on reported combined company results is in fact approximately 3x, which is significantly lower than the 3.8x net debt to EBITDA number that we had estimated when we announced the deal. So moving to capital additions, which in the second quarter were $47 million for the combined company and are planned to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million for the year in 2017. During the quarter, we also paid $139 million in dividends and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 9. And that represents an annual dividend payment to shareholders of $1.80 per share. Okay. So with that, I will turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which again is on a combined company basis and excludes special items outlined in today’s release. Vincent Roche Thanks Ali. After a strong second quarter performance, we are planning for a continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and for revenue to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. By end market, we are planning for continued sequential revenue growth in industrial and for the communications end market to remain stable to the prior quarter. In automotive, we anticipate that seasonal trends would prevail, which would suggest a mid single-digit sequential decline in the third quarter. In the consumer market, we are planning for modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 69% and 70% as we keep utilization levels stable to their second quarter rates and benefit from higher industrial revenue mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be between $430 million and $440 million. Notably, this translates into an operating margin range of 38% to 40% in the third quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.21. While we continue to see good business conditions, we are always pragmatic and cautious in how we manage our business and in how we convert our precious resources into free cash flow. On this point, with the combination complete, ADI’s free cash flow margin now ranks within the top 5% of the S&P 500. At our Investor Day on June 20, we will outline our plan to drive the long-term profitable growth for ADI, leveraging the customer value creation capabilities of our innovation and business diversity and our focus on best-in-class operational efficiencies to continue to drive our free cash flow to even higher levels. So with that, we are ready now to take your questions. Ali Husain Alright. Thanks Vince. So before we get to the Q&A session, just a couple of quick housekeeping items for me. So note that we will be hosting an Investor Day on June 20. It’s accessible via live webcast. I invite you all to tune in on June 20 to hear more about our long-term strategy and the new financial model for the company. And so let’s get to the Q&A session. We will try our best to get to all of our callers, so please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up. So operator, can we have our first question, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

Shantanu Narayen Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. FY ‘16 was another great year for Adobe. Our record growth and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4, was $0.80 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY ‘16, was $2.32 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. In Digital Media, we are advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design. And in FY ‘16, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our Creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. Earlier this week, we released two public betas, Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion dollar stock image category. In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock contributor site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world’s largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment to the Adobe Stock service. With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teens in China. China is one of the world’s largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach broader consumer audience as part of Creative Cloud. The world’s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels, whether its financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. Adobe’s winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We are seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, UnitedHealthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. In Q4, Adobe managed record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world’s leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights’ Holiday Shopping Report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand side video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in digital marketing and ad tech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our ad tech capabilities will enable Adobe’s customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. Adobe’s success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today’s complex experience challenges. Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei’s services address the critical demands of our creative document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to-date and we are increasingly significant our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. Adobe’s success over the decades is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor’s 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe’s brand momentum has never been stronger and we were honored to be one of the five fastest growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. FY ‘16 was a great year for Adobe. We are driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark? Mark Garrett Thanks Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2016 results. In FY ‘16, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy and noteworthy achievements including growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY ‘16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR, record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represent 33% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of 316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and up-sells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in three key areas growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. Some highlights against these goals during the year include 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe Stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value, or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY ‘16 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an overachievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY ‘16, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY ‘16 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY ‘16. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY ‘16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY ‘15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe’s effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as the result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year ago quarter and 45 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buyback stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. Entering FY ‘17, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our three cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. At our November 2 Financial Analyst Meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY ‘17 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY ‘15 to FY ‘18 financial targets today. Since the Analyst Meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we will be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY ‘17 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today’s FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY ‘17. As a result, we are providing the following FY ‘17 targets. We expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY ‘16, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY ‘16 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY ‘17. By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY ‘17 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY ‘17, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY ‘17 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY ‘16 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY ‘16, all Q1 FY ‘17 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $13 million on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY ‘17 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all three of our cloud solutions and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market. We are excited about what lies ahead for Adobe and look forward to sharing more progress with you in the coming year. Mike? Mike Saviage Thanks Mark.

And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Ashley Thanks so much for taking my question. I was going to look at the Creative Media business, you are hitting on all cylinders, I mean the Creative business is strong, you have strengthened education, Document is coming up the curve, I was going to ask about the consumer opportunity there, can you remind us what you have today in consumer and if there is an opportunity to maybe push out and expand how far you are pushing the consumer market in the future? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I am happy to take that, Steve. You are right and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we are executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we are targeting new customers. I would point out two or three different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we are increasingly seeing those consumers adopt Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. Second category that I will talk about are products like Adobe Spark, we are seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you will see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I have continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It’s our next-generation or whether it’s K-12 students or higher ed, as they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future. Steve Ashley Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kirk Materne Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year to you all. Shantanu, the last time we met you, it’s right the week before the election and I think there is a lot of folks, wondering what you guys have seen sort of post the results from a macro perspective, I know you guys are sort of operating and serve your own cadence right now through your products and your strategy, but I was just kind of curious, I guess especially in the Digital Marketing world where you guys are obviously talking to a lot of enterprises, is there any change in tone or I guess projected spend or anything like that, I was just curious, if you could give us kind of an update on that? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen Sure. Kirk, I have seen a rally in the stock market as well, which I think all of us have certainly experienced. But in addition to that, I would just continue to emphasize this notion of how all enterprises are being transformed by what’s happening in digital and the urgency with which they really need to think about technology that they can leverage to become more of an experienced business. I think that continues to be unabated. As you saw, we had a pretty strong Q4 revenue growth over 30% year-over-year in the Digital Marketing business. And I think the opportunity continues to be one that we are excited about not just in the U.S. but internationally as well, so nothing that we have seen either just before the election or post election changes are belief in the large opportunity and our continued execution in that space, Kirk. Kirk Materne Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sterling Auty Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the overage or the higher than expected demand on-premise perpetual in the Digital Marketing side, how much of that happens in the fourth quarter and if you normalize, how would you kind of characterize the bookings and revenue relative to what your expectations were? Shantanu Narayen Sterling, when we look at the entire year first, let me reflect that we continue to think that we both have the most comprehensive offering. And we are pleased with both the revenue and the bookings growth for the year. I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a not. The fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it’s a competitive advantage. And globally, it’s hard to predict which option customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it’s all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY ‘16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it’s really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. Sterling Auty Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill Thanks. Shantanu, the Asian business has been very strong in the last couple of quarters and I was curious if you could just talk through the fall through that you are seeing there, I know you have also made a bigger push into China where many software companies have not been successful for a lot of reasons, can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing there so far, as you push more aggressively to China? Shantanu Narayen Sure. Brent, I think the two things that we factor in, the first is as we have always stated when we first released Creative Cloud, adoption of Creative Cloud in Asia lagged adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S. and UK for example, as markets. We now are pleased with the adoption that we are seeing. Australia was always a strong market. Australia continues to be a very strong market. So as it relates to Creative Cloud, as we said even having it in China right now, it was long overdue and the fact that we now have Creative Cloud for teams in China, I think shows our commitment to the Chinese digital economy, which we continue to think is one of the largest, so we feel good about it. The other large opportunity as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that’s driven by two different phenomena. The first phenomenon is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect the climate of our solutions, whether it’s in retail, financial services or other places to also be true in China and in India and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that’s continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There is excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it’s all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It’s both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there. Brent Thill Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about the ETLA performance in the fourth quarter and your expectations in terms of ETLA as a part of that $1 billion in incremental ARR next year? And specifically trying to figure out if that – if the new ETLA business is still growing. I know you are kind of coming up on some renewals and so forth there. I just wanted to get a sense of the trajectory? Shantanu Narayen Net summary, Walter, very strong quarter in Q4, I think driven by two different phenomena. The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers it was really more a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I would call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we are using. Starting in fiscal ‘16, we move to a more complete solution which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete and clearly resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY ‘17. Walter Pritchard Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shankar Iyer Hi, this is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on your overall margin profile as you look into the next few years. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the increased investment that you are going to make in Sensei and Adobe Spark and whole lot of other products. But if you also look at the large down potential and the potential that as your partnership that can drive your Marketing Cloud and also your margins down over time, what’s the leverage in the model and can we expect an operating margin to be in the 40% to 45% range there by the end of the decade? Mark Garrett Hey, it’s Mark. Thanks for the question. I am glad I got one. I was getting ready to go home. So first, we are extremely proud of our ability to be one of the only, if not the only cloud companies that can grow significantly on top line and bottom line and the fact that we got to $3.01 this year and being well ahead of our guidance is something that we are very proud of. We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year’s guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you are going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for ‘18. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I am not going to say at this point that we are going to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008, but you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model and we feel very good about that. Shankar Iyer Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stan Zlotsky Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith Weiss. So, I actually wanted to ask a question on the Document Services business, the ARR that you added in Q4 was very impressive. You guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks, the fastest and the most that you have added all year, so what was the driver of that outperformance in the quarter? And more broadly, as you moved the Document Services business to subscription, how are you thinking about that versus the kind of strategy that you adopted moving to Creative Cloud business to subscription as well? So, thank you. Shantanu Narayen Yes, I think two comments come to mind there. First is it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment, ARR, it probably under-represents the momentum that we have with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they are using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we are seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality where it’s I would say one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation I think in that space just reflects as paper to digital is this macro trend. We are very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that. Mike Saviage Next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. Mark, don’t go home yet. I have a question for you. So the question concerns cash flow. Mike Saviage Jay, it’s Mike. I am glad you are in our call, not the Oracle call like others. Thanks. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay, you are very welcome. So, you just grew your GAAP operating cash flow by about $800 million in ‘16. And the question is how are you thinking about cash flow in ‘17? Do you think you could achieve a similar increment even considering all the investments of course that you are talking about, particularly in terms of geographic expansion in Asia, and of course, R&D? Mark Garrett Yes, Jay. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we had extremely strong cash flow on the year, really good cash flow in Q4. As I look into next year, I expect very strong cash flow again. I will say, I am glad you asked the question, I will say just so everybody understands cash flow from Q4 to Q1 always naturally declines. We have a lot of payments that get made in the first quarter for commissions and bonuses and things like that. So you should expect a pretty substantial decline just sequentially, but I do fully expect another strong cash flow year next year. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, could you talk about perhaps the non net income components of that? I mean, how are you thinking in terms, for example, of deferred in particular? Mark Garrett Again, I expect deferred to continue to increase as we drive bookings faster than we are driving revenue. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay, good. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan Thanks for taking my question. Mark, when we look at ARR, big picture I guess is that we added about $1.1 billion this year, ‘16, about the same level as fiscal ‘15. We are talking about $1 billion in ‘17, so there is really very little decay in the rate of new ARR being added. And I know you are not yet talking about the year even further out. But how should we be thinking about that kind of pace of moderation shall we see in that ARR increment? And the question really goes to this sort of notion of where we are both in terms of new user adds and base transition? I am just curious to just your high level thoughts. Mark Garrett I mean, we have – like you say, we have been consistently adding around $1 billion. And we feel very good about that number. We continue to attract new users. We continue to drive higher ARPU. We are getting people off of promotions on to full price. We are adding value-add services like Stock, all of those things help drive that ARR number. Retention helps drive that ARR number. So, there is lots of different ways that we can do that. And as you know, we are addressing a much bigger TAM than we were addressing a number of years ago. So all of that plays into our ability, we believe to continue to drive that kind of net new ARR. Ross MacMillan And then just one other just follow-up quickly, just on the seasonality of ARR this year, I think this will be the first year where we actually see decline in fiscal Q3. Is that just the base effect like the numbers are getting bigger, are there any particular things this year we should think about as we transition Q2 to Q3 that maybe we didn’t see last year or the prior year? Mark Garrett Yes, there is nothing new. We are just trying to make sure we incorporate seasonality. I mean Q3 is a slower seasonal quarter for buying for us and we just want to factor that in. Ross MacMillan Okay, thanks again. Congratulations. Shantanu Narayen Thank you. Mark Garrett Thanks Ross. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Wieser Thanks for taking the question. Following the TubeMogul acquisition, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about any other aspects of that type you think you maybe emphasizing investment in whether internal or external and may be relatedly, Tube made a pretty strong focus as an independent company on the demand side orientation, given the business you have on Primetime, I am wondering if you expect it will have some supply side orientation as well? Shantanu Narayen I think at this point Brian, what I would say is we are excited about the TubeMogul acquisition. And we are excited about the long-term video as well as data opportunity. Just to highlight from our point of view, TubeMogul enables – it’s more heft in our Ad Tech platform, which is a key part of as we are targeting the CMO or the Chief Revenue Officer or the Chief Digital Officer at an enterprise and adding to what we have in display, search and social, so that’s good. To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what’s perhaps more strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMV, we are seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry leading audience manager DMV. That has really become in fiscal ‘16, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers. And to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have. So excited about it and we will say more about that after we close. Brian Wieser Great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Cogan Thanks. It’s Jack Cogan filling in for Heather. So you mentioned Creative Cloud ARPU continues to grow sequentially, I just wondered if you could rank order the drivers behind this, I know you mentioned that users on promo pricing, renewing at full price, new offerings like Stock, maybe if you can just put into context what sort of the biggest drivers are and how long we should expect a tailwind like the promo users renewing at full price to exist? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen All of them are clearly driving the transition of the business to ARR. I would say people are migrating off of the promotional pricing. And as long as they continue to retain to full price, that’s certainly one of the large drivers. I think we talked about enterprise as one of the large drivers. The mix as it moves from single app to complete is another driver. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And that’s why our strategy of getting more and more people on to the platform, we actually did fewer promotions in the quarter, they were more targeted promotions, so they were successful. And that gives you some color, I think. Stock and Sign are starting to become reasonable ARR and we expect continued growth in both those areas as well. Jack Cogan Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on the last one, so some recent survey work that we have done suggest that the majority of enterprises have yet to upgrade to Windows 10, but they plan to do so within the next 12 months to 24 months, so I am just curious, how much of the as yet converted suite days is running Windows versus iOS and do you expect because I didn’t hear you mention in the last answer that those Windows 10 upgrades would drive some of the ARR growth in fiscal ‘17? Shantanu Narayen I think big picture, what I would say in that particular space is whenever there are hardware transitions or software transitions with significant new functionality, they always represent opportunities for us to accelerate migration. When people look at Windows in particular, I think what’s most exciting to them is in addition to the incredible hardware that Microsoft and other companies are doing, the fact that it’s touch-enabled, has really made a very significant difference. Video capabilities also in that platform are just so powerful that there is clearly migration from the high end proprietary video systems into PCs, so that hopefully gives you some color. I think Apple continues to innovate. But with Windows 10, as people migrate, it always is an opportunity for us to work with that transition team, to make sure that they also migrate to Creative Cloud. Michael Nemeroff Thank you very much. Mike Saviage Operator, we are coming up on to the top of the hour. Why don’t we take one more question? Operator Your last question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samad Samana Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. I apologize if my question has already been asked. I jumped on late. But could you give us any idea, you gave that 1 million use of Photoshop subs that you added on your photography package, maybe any color on just what the full year trend looks like for full Creative Cloud adds and if there is any change in either the retention rate that you saw there or the add-on rates for the Adobe Stock package that the Creative Cloud packs that included Stock? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen I think with respect to both the addition of subs as well as the migration of the business, all of them just continue to be really powerful. If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core Creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes – if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it’s also higher than 80%. So as we look at retention, it’s actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we are pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. Shantanu Narayen And since that was the last question, for me my summary remarks would be while FY ‘16 was clearly a great year, in many ways I am even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the two big areas of focus for Adobe empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represent massive opportunities in our content and data platform really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we are innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth. I would like to thank our customers, partners, employees and investors and wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us. Mike Saviage And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Ashley Thanks so much for taking my question. I was going to look at the Creative Media business, you are hitting on all cylinders, I mean the Creative business is strong, you have strengthened education, Document is coming up the curve, I was going to ask about the consumer opportunity there, can you remind us what you have today in consumer and if there is an opportunity to maybe push out and expand how far you are pushing the consumer market in the future? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I am happy to take that, Steve. You are right and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we are executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we are targeting new customers. I would point out two or three different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we are increasingly seeing those consumers adopt Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. Second category that I will talk about are products like Adobe Spark, we are seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you will see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I have continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It’s our next-generation or whether it’s K-12 students or higher ed, as they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future. Steve Ashley Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kirk Materne Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year to you all. Shantanu, the last time we met you, it’s right the week before the election and I think there is a lot of folks, wondering what you guys have seen sort of post the results from a macro perspective, I know you guys are sort of operating and serve your own cadence right now through your products and your strategy, but I was just kind of curious, I guess especially in the Digital Marketing world where you guys are obviously talking to a lot of enterprises, is there any change in tone or I guess projected spend or anything like that, I was just curious, if you could give us kind of an update on that? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen Sure. Kirk, I have seen a rally in the stock market as well, which I think all of us have certainly experienced. But in addition to that, I would just continue to emphasize this notion of how all enterprises are being transformed by what’s happening in digital and the urgency with which they really need to think about technology that they can leverage to become more of an experienced business. I think that continues to be unabated. As you saw, we had a pretty strong Q4 revenue growth over 30% year-over-year in the Digital Marketing business. And I think the opportunity continues to be one that we are excited about not just in the U.S. but internationally as well, so nothing that we have seen either just before the election or post election changes are belief in the large opportunity and our continued execution in that space, Kirk. Kirk Materne Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sterling Auty Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the overage or the higher than expected demand on-premise perpetual in the Digital Marketing side, how much of that happens in the fourth quarter and if you normalize, how would you kind of characterize the bookings and revenue relative to what your expectations were? Shantanu Narayen Sterling, when we look at the entire year first, let me reflect that we continue to think that we both have the most comprehensive offering. And we are pleased with both the revenue and the bookings growth for the year. I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a not. The fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it’s a competitive advantage. And globally, it’s hard to predict which option customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it’s all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY ‘16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it’s really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. Sterling Auty Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill Thanks. Shantanu, the Asian business has been very strong in the last couple of quarters and I was curious if you could just talk through the fall through that you are seeing there, I know you have also made a bigger push into China where many software companies have not been successful for a lot of reasons, can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing there so far, as you push more aggressively to China? Shantanu Narayen Sure. Brent, I think the two things that we factor in, the first is as we have always stated when we first released Creative Cloud, adoption of Creative Cloud in Asia lagged adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S. and UK for example, as markets. We now are pleased with the adoption that we are seeing. Australia was always a strong market. Australia continues to be a very strong market. So as it relates to Creative Cloud, as we said even having it in China right now, it was long overdue and the fact that we now have Creative Cloud for teams in China, I think shows our commitment to the Chinese digital economy, which we continue to think is one of the largest, so we feel good about it. The other large opportunity as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that’s driven by two different phenomena. The first phenomenon is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect the climate of our solutions, whether it’s in retail, financial services or other places to also be true in China and in India and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that’s continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There is excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it’s all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It’s both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there. Brent Thill Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about the ETLA performance in the fourth quarter and your expectations in terms of ETLA as a part of that $1 billion in incremental ARR next year? And specifically trying to figure out if that – if the new ETLA business is still growing. I know you are kind of coming up on some renewals and so forth there. I just wanted to get a sense of the trajectory? Shantanu Narayen Net summary, Walter, very strong quarter in Q4, I think driven by two different phenomena. The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers it was really more a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I would call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we are using. Starting in fiscal ‘16, we move to a more complete solution which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete and clearly resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY ‘17. Walter Pritchard Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shankar Iyer Hi, this is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on your overall margin profile as you look into the next few years. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the increased investment that you are going to make in Sensei and Adobe Spark and whole lot of other products. But if you also look at the large down potential and the potential that as your partnership that can drive your Marketing Cloud and also your margins down over time, what’s the leverage in the model and can we expect an operating margin to be in the 40% to 45% range there by the end of the decade? Mark Garrett Hey, it’s Mark. Thanks for the question. I am glad I got one. I was getting ready to go home. So first, we are extremely proud of our ability to be one of the only, if not the only cloud companies that can grow significantly on top line and bottom line and the fact that we got to $3.01 this year and being well ahead of our guidance is something that we are very proud of. We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year’s guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you are going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for ‘18. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I am not going to say at this point that we are going to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008, but you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model and we feel very good about that.

So you mentioned Creative Cloud ARPU continues to grow sequentially, I just wondered if you could rank order the drivers behind this, I know you mentioned that users on promo pricing, renewing at full price, new offerings like Stock, maybe if you can just put into context what sort of the biggest drivers are and how long we should expect a tailwind like the promo users renewing at full price to exist? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen All of them are clearly driving the transition of the business to ARR. I would say people are migrating off of the promotional pricing. And as long as they continue to retain to full price, that’s certainly one of the large drivers. I think we talked about enterprise as one of the large drivers. The mix as it moves from single app to complete is another driver. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And that’s why our strategy of getting more and more people on to the platform, we actually did fewer promotions in the quarter, they were more targeted promotions, so they were successful. And that gives you some color, I think. Stock and Sign are starting to become reasonable ARR and we expect continued growth in both those areas as well. Jack Cogan Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on the last one, so some recent survey work that we have done suggest that the majority of enterprises have yet to upgrade to Windows 10, but they plan to do so within the next 12 months to 24 months, so I am just curious, how much of the as yet converted suite days is running Windows versus iOS and do you expect because I didn’t hear you mention in the last answer that those Windows 10 upgrades would drive some of the ARR growth in fiscal ‘17? Shantanu Narayen I think big picture, what I would say in that particular space is whenever there are hardware transitions or software transitions with significant new functionality, they always represent opportunities for us to accelerate migration. When people look at Windows in particular, I think what’s most exciting to them is in addition to the incredible hardware that Microsoft and other companies are doing, the fact that it’s touch-enabled, has really made a very significant difference. Video capabilities also in that platform are just so powerful that there is clearly migration from the high end proprietary video systems into PCs, so that hopefully gives you some color. I think Apple continues to innovate. But with Windows 10, as people migrate, it always is an opportunity for us to work with that transition team, to make sure that they also migrate to Creative Cloud. Michael Nemeroff Thank you very much. Mike Saviage Operator, we are coming up on to the top of the hour. Why don’t we take one more question? Operator Your last question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samad Samana Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. I apologize if my question has already been asked. I jumped on late. But could you give us any idea, you gave that 1 million use of Photoshop subs that you added on your photography package, maybe any color on just what the full year trend looks like for full Creative Cloud adds and if there is any change in either the retention rate that you saw there or the add-on rates for the Adobe Stock package that the Creative Cloud packs that included Stock? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen I think with respect to both the addition of subs as well as the migration of the business, all of them just continue to be really powerful. If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core Creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes – if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it’s also higher than 80%. So as we look at retention, it’s actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we are pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. Shantanu Narayen And since that was the last question, for me my summary remarks would be while FY ‘16 was clearly a great year, in many ways I am even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the two big areas of focus for Adobe empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represent massive opportunities in our content and data platform really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we are innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth. I would like to thank our customers, partners, employees and investors and wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us. Mike Saviage And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.

Shantanu Narayen Thanks Mike and good afternoon. Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with record revenue of $1.68 billion and record profit, GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.94. We continue to execute well against our strategy, and are driving momentum across our entire business. Digital transformation has created a tailwind for Adobe among a diverse spectrum of customers in a broad number of industries, from students, to designers, to the public sector, and the world’s largest brands. Once the domain solely of professionals, today everyone is a creator; from the teenager doing a school photography project; to the small business owner, prototyping her Web site to the film-maker; working on his first documentary; and designers become a critical element in the fabric of our lives. Design is the starting point for every connection we make, and great design requires innovative technology. At the same time, massive amounts of data, the proliferation of devices and skyrocketing customer expectations, are forcing enterprises to completely rethink their business strategies. To forge stronger customer connections that lead to brand loyalty and growth, forward-looking enterprises are reimagining the experience they provide to their customers. At Adobe, we’ve have always known that a great customer experience is the differentiator that separates market leaders from the pack. At the center of every great experience are customer intelligence and amazing design, and these are Adobe’s core competencies. Our mission to help our customers design and deliver great experiences has never been more relevant as is reflected in our outstanding Q1 results. In Digital Media, we continue to be the undisputed leader in helping customers inject creativity into their jobs, schoolwork and their daily lives. We achieved a record $1.14 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q1 and exited the quarter with over $4.25 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q1 was $265 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud business. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creatives the world over and we continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments, and adding value through new services. In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers. This year, two of Adobe’s iconic creative apps are celebrating anniversaries. In March, Adobe Illustrator, the industry-standard vector graphics app that lets you create logos, typography, and complex illustrations for print, web, video, and mobile, celebrated its 30th anniversary. 30 years of Illustrator projects are visible everywhere across the world, from billboards on U.S. highways to magazine covers in Tokyo. More than 180 million graphics are created monthly with Illustrator. Earlier this week, we celebrated Premiere Pro’s 25th anniversary. Premiere Pro is the world’s leading video production solution, and continues to grow its footprint across every video segment. Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January. Premiere Pro’s virtual reality workflows are seeing strong adoption with the majority of the films in the Virtual Reality category at Sundance having used it in their creative process. As part of our year-long celebration, we are partnering with the Grammy-award-winning band, Imagine Dragons, which just released the music video for its newest song, Believer. Earlier this week, we announced that creatives in 27 countries will have the chance to take the raw video footage from the original video and cut their own version. Our Adobe Stock service business continues to accelerate. In the past year, we have grown Adobe Stock assets to more than 60 million and in January, we announced a partnership with 500px, a global online photography community, which expands Adobe Stock’s Premium collection. The world’s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud enables businesses to reinvent inefficient paper-based processes. In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $196 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $493 million. Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined, again grew double-digits year-over-year. This achievement was driven by new customer acquisition with our subscription model and the funnel of users created by the broad use of PDF and the proliferation of Adobe Reader across mobile devices. In February, in conjunction with the Cloud Signature Consortium, we unveiled the world’s first open cloud-based digital signature standard, available in any browser and on any device. We announced new functionality in Adobe Sign that enables users to create end-to-end business workflows, such as advanced document routing, online collaboration and Microsoft SharePoint integration. Adobe Sign now includes mobile tools, powered by Adobe Sensei, for scanning, reading, routing and signing documents. Deep intelligence fueled by trillions of data transactions are the foundation of our Digital Marketing business. We drove a record $477 million in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue in Q1, which was 26% year-over-year revenue growth. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to lead the category and be the most comprehensive offering for global brands, government agencies and institutions that need to deliver personal, consistent and relevant experiences to their audiences everywhere and every time they connect with them. Adobe Marketing Cloud features best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaign management and media optimization. We managed more than 100 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past year across our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. In February, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs research report. For the third consecutive time, Adobe was ranked the highest in completeness of vision axis among the 22 companies that were evaluated. Also in Q1, Adobe was recognized as a Leader in the Forrester Wave report on Web Content Management systems, receiving the highest score. Thanks to the completeness of our offering, our continued innovation and our growing partner network, we continue to see strong market momentum, with major customer wins this quarter at Dick’s Sporting Goods, Mercy Health, Hutchison UK, Autotrader.com, Computer Sciences Corporation, ADT and the University of Michigan. In December, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a leader in demand-side video advertising. We achieved strong Q1 TubeMogul revenue, and we are hard at work integrating TubeMogul with our current Adobe Media Optimizer solution. As a combined advertising solution, we will enable Adobe’s customers to optimize their video, search and display advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Next week in Las Vegas, we will conduct our largest Adobe Summit ever, with more than 12,000 attendees, including more than 1,000 of our global partners. Executives from top brands, including the NBA, National Geographic, T-Mobile and Facebook will take the stage and we’ll give an update on our strategic partnership with Microsoft. We’re continuing to aggressively invest in the Adobe Cloud Platform and Adobe Sensei, our unified artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and intelligent services. Our trillions of content and data assets, along with our deep category expertise in the markets we serve, give Adobe Sensei a unique ability to help customers tackle complex experience challenges. We plan to unveil new Adobe Sensei capabilities at Adobe Summit. We will also provide an update on our adobe.io capabilities for partners, ISVs and developers, who can utilize our open platform to develop their own applications. This level of innovation can only come from talented, creative and dedicated employees. Last month, we held our internal Tech Summit where we announced our commitment to train every one of our technical employees in artificial intelligence fundamentals. We also demonstrated the incredible work happening across the Company. Last month, we were included on Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list, and last week we were honored to be named to the Fortune Best Places to Work list for the 17th year. Adobe would not be the Company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future. I would like to thank all our employees for the role they play in our continued success. To create an exceptional customer experience, you need a potent combination of deep intelligence and amazing design. These are our unique capabilities, and our opportunity has never been greater. We have the technology leadership, partner ecosystem and customer relationships, to fundamentally reshape how individuals, brands and institutions transform themselves in the 21st century. Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe. Mark? Mark Garrett Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.68 billion dollars, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.94. When comparing Q1 FY17 and Q1 FY16 results, it is helpful to remember that our year-ago quarter had an extra week due to Adobe’s 52/53 week fiscal year calendar. Factoring in the extra week a year ago in Q1 FY16, year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was greater than 25%. Highlights in Q1 included; achieving $265 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $942 million; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million; strong year-over-year growth in operating income and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 85% of Q1 revenue came from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 22% year-over-year. The addition of $265 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.25 billion exiting Q1. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $942 million, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $244 million during Q1 and exited the quarter with $3.76 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter. Q1 ARR performance was driven by strong subscription adoption and retention; strength with Creative Cloud for teams, particularly in Europe; and continued growth with Adobe Stock. Creative Cloud ARPU was either steady or grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q1. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $196 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $493 million exiting Q1. Driving this growth was continued adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services, such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefitting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. TubeMogul added $32 million of revenue in Q1, which was $13 million above our target of $19 million. Approximately $10 million of the upside was due to some of the TubeMogul revenue being recognized on a gross basis in the quarter rather than on a net basis. Excluding the extra $10 million of gross TubeMogul revenue, year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth was 24%, which was in line with our Q1 target. As we discussed on our TubeMogul conference call in January, we intend to recognize TubeMogul revenue on a net basis. Due to some ongoing contractual commitments, there will be some small gross revenue amounts through year-end. Mobile remains a key driver for our Marketing Cloud business; mobile data transactions grew to 56% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Total data transactions in Q1 grew to $41.3 trillion, and in the trailing four quarters, data transactions with our Marketing Cloud solutions exceeded $100 trillion. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.8 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY16; thus a net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.9 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16; thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $3.2 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q1, Adobe’s effective tax rate was 13.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The Q1 GAAP rate was slightly lower than targeted due to Adobe’s adoption of the new accounting standard affecting taxes related to equity-based costs. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 42 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.06 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.65 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $730 million in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $238 million. We have $300 million remaining under the January 2015 authority, after which we will begin repurchases under our new $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.73 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $290 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q2, which represents both sequential and year-over-year growth in net new ARR achievement. We expect Digital Media Q2 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 24%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be approximately 499 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $15 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.66, and Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.94. In summary, Q1 was an amazing start to what we believe will be another record year for Adobe. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Mike? Mike Saviage Thanks Mark. Next week, Adobe will host its annual Digital Marketing Summit in Las Vegas, with the opening day keynote on the morning of Tuesday March 21st.

And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan Mark, I hate to bring this up but, AC 606, a lot of companies are starting to give it a little thought. I’m wondering if you could give us your perspective on how it would that change the revenue recognition in the Marketing Cloud and also the expense recognition? Thank you so much. Mark Garrett You’ll see that we’ve written some disclosure in our SEC filings on this. The standard, as you know, is effective for Adobe in the first quarter of 2019. So, we have quite a bit of time until it goes effective for us. We don’t plan early adopt that we haven’t selected a transition method yet. We’re clearly evaluating the effect and the standard, and what it will do some revenue for us. We expect that revenue related to professional services in our cloud offerings, or enterprise individual and teams, would remain substantially unchanged. But again, we’re in the process of evaluating that. And as it relates to, what we would call more of an ETLA, a term-based license where software and maintenance are bundle together. Those are the arrangements that will like have some impact from the standard. But again, we have until 2019 to work through that. And as you know, we’re now selling the full could solution to the enterprise. So, that’s where we stand as of today. But clearly, more work to do and lots more time. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty On the Creative Cloud side, the growth of momentum continues to be strong. But can you give us a little more at least qualitative color as to the drivers of it. How much of it might be something you’re doing on price and managing promotions? How much are you adding new customers, and how much of it is deeper penetration into existing customers? Shantanu Narayen Sterling, I’ll take that question. I think we’re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well. As you know that’s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering. And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter. I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter that’s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud. In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention. And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well. And also, there is no question that we’re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes. So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings. And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks. So, that continues to be strong as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin Shantanu, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question for you about what you’re seeing in terms of the growth of front-office budgets. And maybe what change you’ve observed this year, or at least start this year from, maybe the last year and the year before that. And how is that driving a change in kind of -- is that accelerating your visionary way because it seems like the shift of the digital transformation budget to the importance of the CEO level has really accelerated; so just curious to get your thoughts on that. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. I think big picture, the conversations that we’re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda. And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge. And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind. And we're part of all of those conversations. I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people. But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do. But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard I heard your response Shantanu on the question around demand drivers. I'm wondering if you can just talk about ARPU, specifically as a driver in fiscal '17 and beyond. In addition to like your commentary around stock suggested that you were seeing more of an uptick there, and you have things like Sensei and so forth that are incremental to the product that you're delivering in the market. Can you help us understand how much more of a driver ARPU is versus what it’s been over the last several years in this transition? Shantanu Narayen Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise. As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs. And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new. And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past. As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services. So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services. And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well. To your point, stock had a good quarter. We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory. Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding. And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value. And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini Shantanu, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the success of Creative Cloud impact the adoption of the marketing suites. And I know that's been one of your goals that one could help drive the other. But have you seen any change in the ability for you being the industry standard for Creative, start to impact the Marketing Cloud side of the business? And has the messaging with customer and the receptivity started to -- have you seen any noticeable difference over the last 12 months? Shantanu Narayen It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise. There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it’s ever been. So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits. I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us. And the expectation is that’s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery. So, we’re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, it’s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan Mark, I didn’t see any commentary on fiscal ’17 guidance. I’m just curious, I guess specifically, about how you are thinking on the 1 billion ARR target, given the strength in Q1 and your guide for Q2, which is certainly above our number. Mark Garrett Clearly, from our perspective, the business is performing exceptionally well. We had a great Q1 across all the key metrics. And to your point, we provided we think are strong Q2 targets. If you remember back, we’ve guided FY ’17 the first time at Analyst Day back in November of last year. We updated it again in December with Q4 earnings. We updated it once more in January for TubeMogul. And we just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance so frequently. So, we’re very happy with the first quarter. We’re very pleased with what we were able to do from a guidance perspective on Q2. Clearly, we’ve got momentum. We just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance that frequently. Ross MacMillan And then one just quick one, just looking at Q2 guide it implies, at least I think in our model that operating margins maybe are down a little bit sequentially. And I know we have a little bit of an extra three weeks, I think from Tube. But are there any other factors for us to think about in terms of OpEx this quarter, Summit or anything else that’s unusual? Thanks. Mark Garrett Our salary increases kick-in for the Company and that has an effect on Q2 from a cost perspective. You’ll see that every year. We continue to hire and invest in the Company. Again, we feel great about our performance in Q1 and our ability to drive leverage in the model going forward. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss On the Marketing Cloud side, you talked about and there’s Gartner Magic Quadrant that came out during the quarter, and I think Forrester Wave. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment? Are any of the surround guys or any of the big guys like the Microsoft or the Oracle of the world getting more competitive in that Marketing Cloud field for you guys? And then on as a follow up, any initial gains or any initial benefits you guys are seeing from Microsoft relationship in FY17? Shantanu Narayen Let me take the second first, which is, you’ll get an update as well as Summit. So we’re hoping a lot of will be at Summit. I think you’ll be pleased with how quickly we’ve been able to integrate the products. And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven. Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics. And I think the team has done a great job. But next week we’ll give you a little bit of an update on that. On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about. This is a $40 billion TAM. Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity. But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that we’re strong continues to be excellent. I think we have a differentiated solution. And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader. But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer Question for Mark, as you know, I am particularly interested in your gross margin structure and the various components of that. You had a couple of dichotomous outcomes in Q1 expect to cost revenue the graphic you addressed. You had an usually large sequential increase in digital marketing; cost of revenue were before you’ve been seeing some margin expansion there. Was that tied somehow to the TubeMogul mobile revenue upside given the way they were recording and their cost of revenues versus their gross revenue recognition? On the other hand you had a pretty material and sequential decrease in digital media COGS. Is that anomalous, or is that something that you think is sustainable? And lastly, you had a pretty significant increase in services cost of revenue, your revenues were down materially from Q4 to Q1, so lots of moving pieces in COGS. But maybe you can address those? Mark Garrett Yes, I mean the still biggest thing probably worth mentioning Jay, is you’re exactly right. If you look at Digital Marketing this quarter that $10 million of gross revenue recognition would flow right into COGS. So you have $10 million of revenue and $10 million of COGS. If you back that $10 million of COGS out of digital marketing, the gross profit would be exactly the same as last quarter. So, there is really no change to Digital Marketing cost of service, it's been pretty consistent. And you are exactly right it's really driven by Tube. On the Digital Media side, I think what you saw this quarter is some of the upside that you see in our revenue relative to our guidance was from a bit more perpetual product, especially on the Acrobat side. And that comes, as you know, a very, very high gross margin. So, that’s why you would have seen Digital Media gross margin better this quarter. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And the services piece? Mark Garrett I can't remember what your question was. It was back to… Jay Vleeschhouwer So, services revenue were down sequentially, but you had a pretty meaningful sequential increase in services COGS? Mark Garrett The revenues down sequentially mainly because in Q4 it's a very difficult time for the teams to deliver services with holidays and year-end. So, typically Q1 revenue is going to be a little bit lighter on the services side, and the cost of services doesn't change that much. So, that's why you see a little bit less on the gross margin side. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Samad Samana So, we saw that in early February, the Company pushed-out price increases in some international, or outside of the U.S., in some countries where FX is a particular headwind. I'm curious if you learned any lessons from those price increases, and whether it shows you what the appetite for customers is. Is this to accept those, and how it impacts your thought on raising prices in the U.S.? Mark Garrett We did push-out some price increases around the world in various markets, because of FX to stay FX neutral, if you will. And the good news there is we really did not see an impact to ARR. So, that does give us confidence that down the road we're able to tweak pricing a bit. We're not taking advantage of that yet other than FX, but that was a very good sign. Samad Samana Maybe just a quick follow up. Could you give us what the Marketing Cloud revenue growth would have grown year-over-year, excluding the extra week, and the revenue contribution from TubeMogul, just for an apples-to-apples compare? Thanks. Mark Garrett With the week, I'm going to have to get back to you. The TubeMogul gross, you just take out $10 million and instead of $26 million it would have been $24 million. But I don't have the week broken out between the different businesses. It was about $75 million, we said a year ago, but we didn't split it between businesses. I don't think it's very material for Digital Marketing, to be honest with you. It's more material on the media side, that extra week; because you think about it as recognizing revenue from subscribers, it doesn't change that much from a enterprise perspective. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood Shantanu, you mentioned the Adobe Stock has $60 million assets now, and I don't really know how this compares to other offerings. But I know you guys announced partnership with [technical difficulty] a few months ago. And I guess I am just curious how impactful it is when you onboard new content into the service. So, specifically, do you think these partnerships move the needle and increase the attach rate, or getting people to subscribe to the monthly version? And would you say growth is tied to bringing more content onboard, or are you really at that full scale? Shantanu Narayen The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products. I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop. So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product. So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest. The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory. So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market. And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide. And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that’s out there. Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right. So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it. Now, I think in all three of those, we’re continuing to make great progress. And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant. It’s an area we’ll continue to invest in. So, we feel good about it Derrick. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Davis Just real quick question. So it seems to me and you’ve touched on this. So you’re becoming a lot more critical to your customers, and typically that means larger deals. But larger deals have a different selling motion and cadence, and staff dynamics. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- what you believe you need to do to evolve and position yourself to move to larger deals? I mean you obviously keep up with the small stuff too. But that would be helpful. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. The good news is we’re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products. I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas. Where we think we have a world class organization that does that. Because it’s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we’re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects. So I actually feel good about all of those. In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that’s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that. So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we’ve invested in over the last few years. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brent Bracelin Mark, I wanted to go back to the operating margin, non-GAAP operating margins of 36% this quarter. Should be above where we had thought they’d be. If you go back to last two years, Q1 was the low-point. And then you saw basically improvement throughout the year. Is there something different about this year, or different that we should think about, relative to additional expenses or hiring plans that might be a different sequence? And then as a follow-up to that, if I go back and look at where op margins could go, I think the peak was back in 2008 at 40%. How you’re thinking about the op margin trajectory longer term? Mark Garrett There is no difference on the cost side than what you’ve seen in prior years. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, on the revenue side in Q1, we did have a little bit of the upside coming from some increased perpetual revenue on Acrobat side of the business, on the toolbar distribution deal. And that revenue upside can typically drop-down to the bottom-line pretty readily. So, that’s where you saw a bit more margin than we had guided in the first quarter. Expense wise is no real change to our trajectory, and there hasn’t been for quite some time. In terms of long-term margins, the best I can do for you right now is few things; one is we’re very focused on margin; you see that in any given quarter; you see that when we over-achieve on revenue like we did Q1. And we gave a three year model a little while back that shows what margins could look like through, at least '18. And if you looked at that model and looked at it back when we gave it to you, you would see margins up above 35%. Beyond that, we will see. Mike Saviage Operator, we’ll take two more questions please. Operator Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Pat Walravens Shantanu, probably for you, what key points would you make to investors at this point about your activation strategy going forward, and what you’re looking for? Shantanu Narayen We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies. And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we’re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense. And so we have done some when they make sense. But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we’ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how the upsell stock in the Marketing Cloud customers is going relative to the Creative Cloud. As that would seem to be somewhat of untapped opportunities that we don’t talk perhaps as much about? Just kind of curious how should we think about that as another step forward in terms of stock? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about. If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs. And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions. And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we’re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services. And the service that is top of mind for as Stock. So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on. And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business. But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we’re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we’ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves. And I think we’ll continue to be unique in that, we’re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings. We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever. We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision. But thank you for joining us today.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan Mark, I hate to bring this up but, AC 606, a lot of companies are starting to give it a little thought. I’m wondering if you could give us your perspective on how it would that change the revenue recognition in the Marketing Cloud and also the expense recognition? Thank you so much. Mark Garrett You’ll see that we’ve written some disclosure in our SEC filings on this. The standard, as you know, is effective for Adobe in the first quarter of 2019. So, we have quite a bit of time until it goes effective for us. We don’t plan early adopt that we haven’t selected a transition method yet. We’re clearly evaluating the effect and the standard, and what it will do some revenue for us. We expect that revenue related to professional services in our cloud offerings, or enterprise individual and teams, would remain substantially unchanged. But again, we’re in the process of evaluating that. And as it relates to, what we would call more of an ETLA, a term-based license where software and maintenance are bundle together. Those are the arrangements that will like have some impact from the standard. But again, we have until 2019 to work through that. And as you know, we’re now selling the full could solution to the enterprise. So, that’s where we stand as of today. But clearly, more work to do and lots more time. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty On the Creative Cloud side, the growth of momentum continues to be strong. But can you give us a little more at least qualitative color as to the drivers of it. How much of it might be something you’re doing on price and managing promotions? How much are you adding new customers, and how much of it is deeper penetration into existing customers? Shantanu Narayen Sterling, I’ll take that question. I think we’re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well. As you know that’s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering. And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter. I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter that’s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud. In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention. And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well. And also, there is no question that we’re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes. So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings. And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks. So, that continues to be strong as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin Shantanu, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question for you about what you’re seeing in terms of the growth of front-office budgets. And maybe what change you’ve observed this year, or at least start this year from, maybe the last year and the year before that. And how is that driving a change in kind of -- is that accelerating your visionary way because it seems like the shift of the digital transformation budget to the importance of the CEO level has really accelerated; so just curious to get your thoughts on that. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. I think big picture, the conversations that we’re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda. And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge. And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind. And we're part of all of those conversations. I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people. But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do. But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard I heard your response Shantanu on the question around demand drivers. I'm wondering if you can just talk about ARPU, specifically as a driver in fiscal '17 and beyond. In addition to like your commentary around stock suggested that you were seeing more of an uptick there, and you have things like Sensei and so forth that are incremental to the product that you're delivering in the market. Can you help us understand how much more of a driver ARPU is versus what it’s been over the last several years in this transition? Shantanu Narayen Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise. As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs. And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new. And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past. As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services. So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services. And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well. To your point, stock had a good quarter. We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory. Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding. And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value. And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini Shantanu, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the success of Creative Cloud impact the adoption of the marketing suites. And I know that's been one of your goals that one could help drive the other. But have you seen any change in the ability for you being the industry standard for Creative, start to impact the Marketing Cloud side of the business? And has the messaging with customer and the receptivity started to -- have you seen any noticeable difference over the last 12 months? Shantanu Narayen It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise. There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it’s ever been.

We’re very pleased with what we were able to do from a guidance perspective on Q2. Clearly, we’ve got momentum. We just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance that frequently. Ross MacMillan And then one just quick one, just looking at Q2 guide it implies, at least I think in our model that operating margins maybe are down a little bit sequentially. And I know we have a little bit of an extra three weeks, I think from Tube.

Could you give us what the Marketing Cloud revenue growth would have grown year-over-year, excluding the extra week, and the revenue contribution from TubeMogul, just for an apples-to-apples compare? Thanks. Mark Garrett With the week, I'm going to have to get back to you. The TubeMogul gross, you just take out $10 million and instead of $26 million it would have been $24 million. But I don't have the week broken out between the different businesses. It was about $75 million, we said a year ago, but we didn't split it between businesses. I don't think it's very material for Digital Marketing, to be honest with you. It's more material on the media side, that extra week; because you think about it as recognizing revenue from subscribers, it doesn't change that much from a enterprise perspective. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood Shantanu, you mentioned the Adobe Stock has $60 million assets now, and I don't really know how this compares to other offerings. But I know you guys announced partnership with [technical difficulty] a few months ago. And I guess I am just curious how impactful it is when you onboard new content into the service. So, specifically, do you think these partnerships move the needle and increase the attach rate, or getting people to subscribe to the monthly version? And would you say growth is tied to bringing more content onboard, or are you really at that full scale? Shantanu Narayen The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products. I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop. So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product. So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest. The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory. So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market. And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide. And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that’s out there. Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right. So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it. Now, I think in all three of those, we’re continuing to make great progress. And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant. It’s an area we’ll continue to invest in. So, we feel good about it Derrick. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Davis Just real quick question. So it seems to me and you’ve touched on this. So you’re becoming a lot more critical to your customers, and typically that means larger deals. But larger deals have a different selling motion and cadence, and staff dynamics. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- what you believe you need to do to evolve and position yourself to move to larger deals? I mean you obviously keep up with the small stuff too. But that would be helpful. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. The good news is we’re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products. I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas. Where we think we have a world class organization that does that. Because it’s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we’re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects. So I actually feel good about all of those. In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that’s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that. So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we’ve invested in over the last few years. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brent Bracelin Mark, I wanted to go back to the operating margin, non-GAAP operating margins of 36% this quarter. Should be above where we had thought they’d be. If you go back to last two years, Q1 was the low-point. And then you saw basically improvement throughout the year. Is there something different about this year, or different that we should think about, relative to additional expenses or hiring plans that might be a different sequence? And then as a follow-up to that, if I go back and look at where op margins could go, I think the peak was back in 2008 at 40%. How you’re thinking about the op margin trajectory longer term? Mark Garrett There is no difference on the cost side than what you’ve seen in prior years. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, on the revenue side in Q1, we did have a little bit of the upside coming from some increased perpetual revenue on Acrobat side of the business, on the toolbar distribution deal. And that revenue upside can typically drop-down to the bottom-line pretty readily. So, that’s where you saw a bit more margin than we had guided in the first quarter. Expense wise is no real change to our trajectory, and there hasn’t been for quite some time. In terms of long-term margins, the best I can do for you right now is few things; one is we’re very focused on margin; you see that in any given quarter; you see that when we over-achieve on revenue like we did Q1. And we gave a three year model a little while back that shows what margins could look like through, at least '18. And if you looked at that model and looked at it back when we gave it to you, you would see margins up above 35%. Beyond that, we will see. Mike Saviage Operator, we’ll take two more questions please. Operator Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Pat Walravens Shantanu, probably for you, what key points would you make to investors at this point about your activation strategy going forward, and what you’re looking for? Shantanu Narayen We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies. And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we’re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense. And so we have done some when they make sense. But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we’ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how the upsell stock in the Marketing Cloud customers is going relative to the Creative Cloud. As that would seem to be somewhat of untapped opportunities that we don’t talk perhaps as much about? Just kind of curious how should we think about that as another step forward in terms of stock? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about. If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs. And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions. And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we’re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services. And the service that is top of mind for as Stock. So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on. And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business. But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we’re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we’ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves. And I think we’ll continue to be unique in that, we’re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings. We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever. We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision. But thank you for joining us today.
