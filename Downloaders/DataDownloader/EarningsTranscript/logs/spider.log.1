Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today are Steve Barbarick, our President, Chief Merchandising and Marketing Officer; and Kurt Barton, our Chief Financial Officer. As was previously disclosed in our business update on April 11, a challenging weather played a significant role in our first quarter results, with a very mild January and February and cooler spring temperatures throughout most of March accompanied by March winter storms. The demand for both winter and spring seasonal products was clearly diminished for the quarter. In the markets where weather and sales were more favorable, we pulled forward several spring seasonal receipts, and where weather was less favorable, we acted aggressively addressing excessive winter product, which by quarter end resulted in a clean transition to spring. In April, the weather has turned more spring-like and our consumers are responding positively to our assortments and sales have improved. We know from our many years of experience, the spring sales can shift between the first quarter and second quarters and that is why we have consistently stated that our financial performance can be best accurately assessed, by the halves and not by the individual quarter's business. Looking ahead, we understand that the retail landscape is changing rapidly, and our customers' expectations are evolving as well. Having the right products in stock at the right time and having those products competitively priced and readily available, whether in-store or online is what our customers expect. The shopping experience across all Tractor Supply shopping channels must be seamless, effortless and consistent. And by adding a level of exceptional customer service, we can meet their needs better than any of our competition. With this, evolving landscape in mind, we are making strategic investments throughout the organization to meet the ever-evolving expectations of our customer and further enhance our personal relationship with them. Here are a few of the strategic initiatives that we will believe will enable us to address the current challenges we face within our business and will be instrumental in driving comparable store sales in the future. The first is our customer loyalty program, Neighbor's Club. This was rolled out to all stores as of early April and has 1.5 million members to-date. This program is growing rapidly and has exceeded our original expectations. We are very excited about this program and believe it will become a valuable tool to strengthen that relationship with our customers. Now, we've got a complete picture of the customer shopping history, and that will allow Tractor Supply to gain deeper insights into our customers buying habits and provide us with the ability for more targeted messaging to them. As we leverage our digital communications, we will better inform our customers regarding new products or upcoming events that are of interest to them. While we are still gathering data for the entire chain of stores, initial results from the pilot stores have shown that our Neighbor's Club members shop our stores twice as often as Neighbor's Club non-members, and their average spend is notably higher than non-Neighbor's Club members. The second initiative; we're very excited about and have seen great initial customer response for, is our Buy Online Pickup in Store Program. This program is currently rolling out to the entire chain and will be complete by mid-May. We know our customers value, a number of things, high-quality products, product availability, a quick and easy shopping experience and most of all, great customer service. The Buy Online Pickup in Store Program allows our customers great flexibility and added convenience as they shop with Tractor Supply. They can place an order online, be assured the product is there at the store and pick up that order the same day. And while they are there on our store receive seasoned advice on other products and services that we offer. They no longer have to wait for package to arrive at their home and they don't have the hassle of shipping something back should they need to return it. Our stores are very close to where they live and we'll gladly take the return. Since the rollout, a significant amount of our e-commerce business growth can be attributed to Buy Online Pickup in Store, and we are founding that these transactions carry a higher average order value and many customers are adding purchases to their cart when picking up their online orders in our stores. And finally, with our supply chain, our largest initiative this year is the construction of our new distribution center in the State of New York, which is expected to be completed by the middle of 2018 and shipping products by the end of 2018. This new distribution center will add the necessary capacity for further store expansion in the Northeast Corridor and will also support our expanding digital fulfillment strategy and move us closer to our goal of reaching 90% of the U.S. population within 2 shipping days. So, in summary, we know our business performance has been a bit choppy over the past year and we know that the retail environment is rapidly evolving. We have a plan and we are executing to that plan to realize our long-term target of high single-digit annual sales growth. Some of the tailwinds to the business over the past several years, such as the C.U.E. expansion, some of the big ticket sales, some of the benefit of the oil and gas markets and the impacts of inflation have either slowed or become headwinds today. We know it's our responsibility to address those shifts and find ways to move the business forward. We have a strong and proven business model that serves a unique customer with specific needs. With our size, scale, store count and growing digital capabilities, we believe there is no other farm store retailer that can serve this customer the way we can. We are confident, we are investing in the areas that will drive sustainable long-term growth, but we cannot guarantee that this growth will always be on a smooth and linear path. We will, however, continue to be as transparent as possible about our business and will keep you updated on our initiatives and their progress. As always I want to thank all of our dedicated Tractor Supply team members who give great customer service every day to all our customers and the other frontline of our business. A big thank you to everyone for all you do in our stores, Merchandise Innovation Center, distribution facilities, and our Store Support Center. I still believe you are the best team in retail. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Kurt Barton, who will take you through the first quarter results in more detail. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. For the quarter ended April 1, 2017, on a consolidated year-over-year basis, net sales were $1.56 billion, resulting in net income of $60.3 million and earnings per share of $0.46 per diluted share. Comparable store sales decreased 2.2% versus a reported increase of 4.9% last year. As a reminder, our Q1 2017 comparable store results reflect the calendar shift associated with the 53rd week in 2016. Adjusting for the week shift, last year's comparable store sales increase would have been 2.6%. As we indicated in our last earnings call, we anticipated Q1 to be a challenging sales quarter. If you recall the first quarter last year benefited from very cold weather in January, which drove the sale of winter related items. Q1 of last year also benefited from both warm March temperatures and an early Easter, which drove sales of early spring merchandise. Unfortunately, we experienced a complete opposite situation in first quarter 2017. In this year's first quarter, January and February weather was very warm, and we then had cooler temperatures and snow in March. January and February's warmer than normal conditions of this year impacted demand for winter seasonal products. Additionally, the March winter storms, which primarily hit the Midwest and Northeast, but also reached down into parts of the Southern regions quickly silenced any early demand for spring seasonal products. The impact on comp sales from softness in seasonal products was relatively equal between winter and spring seasonal goods. Sales were weakest in the Northern regions of the country where the impact of weather was most pronounced, both in winter and spring seasonal products. The Southern regions were less impacted by the weather conditions, but we're cycling a tough compare from last year's strong performance. The difference in comp sales performance between the Northern and Southern regions, excluding the Western region was approximately 600 basis points. The Western region which experienced less weather volatility had a solid mid single-digit comp sales growth. We continue to see strength in the Western region as we expand our store base and gain market awareness and share. We continue to experience increased demand for many of our basic everyday items, such as our livestock and pet category, which generated low single-digit comparable chain-wide sales. Excluding the impact of certain weather influenced categories, such as bird feeding, animal health and fencing, we continue to be pleased with the overall performance of this category. While there is a seasonal component to the livestock and pet category, we were pleased with the continued increase in comp units and sales dollars in the pet food and animal feed categories. And we see no evidence that we are losing market share in this core area of the business. Comp transaction count decreased 1.4% compared to a reported 4.2% increase last year or 2.6% in the prior year adjusted for the week shift. The growth in many of our C.U.E. items such as pet and animal food was more than offset by the lack of demand in winter seasonal products such as heating units and insulated outerwear and spring seasonal products such as lawn and garden, animal health and ag chemicals. The average ticket decreased by approximately 90 basis points. Big ticket sales declined and deflation were the two primary drivers of this quarter's average ticket decrease. Comparable sales of big ticket items were down high single-digits year-over-year. The comparable sales decline of big ticket items was primarily driven by a slower start to spring seasonal products such as riding lawn mowers, 3-point equipment and trailers, as well as continued softness in the safe business. Deflation was slightly higher than we anticipated at approximately 50 basis points, driven principally by heating fuel, bird feed, livestock feed and lubricant categories. As Greg stated, the weather shifted to more typical spring conditions in early April. And as a result, we have seen consumer demand increase. Also as a reminder, Petsense store sales are not reflected in same-store sales, as those will fall into the store base, beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017. Now turning to gross margin, which decreased 60 basis points to 33.1%, compared to a 30 basis point increase in the prior year. In certain cold weather seasonal products where there was limited demand, we increased markdowns to ensure that we ended the season in a clean inventory position. Additionally, we were slightly more promotional in our efforts to drive sales by creating value for our customer. Freight negatively impacted gross margin, principally due to a greater mix of freight intensive categories, growth in our e-commerce business and to a lesser extent, higher average fuel costs. The mix of merchandise had a slightly negative impact on gross margin. This was driven by the strength of sales in C.U.E. product, specifically animal and pet food, which are below chain average margin categories. Petsense provided a benefit to gross margin as they produced a higher rate than Tractor Supply stores. Also, it should be noted that last year in the first quarter margin benefited approximately 15 basis points from vendor support programs associated with the initial stocking of our new Arizona DC. For the quarter, SG&A, including depreciation and amortization deleveraged by 70 basis points to 27% of sales compared to 26.3% of sales in the prior year's quarter. The primary driver of the deleverage was the decline in comparable store sales. A few other factors impacting SG&A ratio were Petsense, which operates at a higher SG&A rate and a greater investment in store payroll hours as part of our focus on enhancing the customer experience. And then as a partial offset to the deleverage, we estimate that incentive compensation provided approximately 35 basis points of year-over-year leverage. Our effective income tax rate for the quarter was 35.6% compared to 36.8% last year. The reduction in rate is principally due to the favorable impact of the adoption of the new accounting rules related to the recognition of incremental tax benefit on stock option exercises. The impact is typically strongest in the first quarter due to the timing of equity vesting and a smaller income base in Q1. And thus, we do not expect similar benefit in future quarters. We continue to estimate our full year effective tax rate to be in the range of 36.2% to 36.4%. Turning to the balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, we had a cash balance of $73 million and $611 million outstanding debt compared to a cash balance of $75 million and $250 million outstanding debt last year. During the first quarter, under our stock repurchase program, we acquired 1.6 million shares for $115 million. The consolidated average inventory per store decline of 3.4% reflects the impact of Petsense stores on the chain average. Exclusive of Petsense average inventory levels per store increased 4.2%, principally due to the timing of our spring seasonal build and to some extent, the timing of seasonal sales. With respect to our outlook, we are not updating our guidance at this time, as we have said for many years, we know that weather can impact the timing of sales this time of the year and we believe it's best to evaluate our performance based on the halves rather than the quarters. While our Q1 performance was disappointing, there is still a lot of business ahead of us in the spring summer season, therefore we believe, it is prudent to revisit our guidance at the end of the second quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we will now turn the call over for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you Our first question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll use my one on some of the online stuff. Thanks for some of the color on BOPIS. Any more metrics around kind of just how online sales – I know it's a small number for your guys, but how it's been growing, what percentage of the business it is? And then what else are you working on beyond Buy Online Pickup in Store, those types of things in order to better position the company for omnichannel selling in the years ahead? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Peter, this is Steve Barbarick. And I would tell you, we've made a lot of advancements over the last couple of years and we continue to make traction as we go forward. To give you some bullets into the quarter and what we saw, our web visits were up about 26%. And what's also very exciting is that, if you look at the number of hits we've got the store locator, we had nearly 5 million hits to store locator for the quarter, which is up about 40%. So we know our customers are going online, they're not just looking at content or looking to buy, but also to look where our stores are located. Couple of other tit bits here that I would share with you. Our mobile traffic was over 60% and up to last year, and we continue to see Drop Ship as a real viable source for us. If you combine what we've done now direct-to-customer, as well as what we're seeing with Buy Online Pickup in Store, the early results, I will tell you, as we move into the back half of this year, I suspect for the full year we will be between probably 1% and 2% of sales, so we're seeing nice growth there. Then if you look at some of what we're doing in terms of capabilities, as Greg said, evolve to what customers needs, we talk a lot internally, and I think, we introduced this to you all at the Investor Meeting this concept of ONETractor. And it's really making sure we're taking the care of the customer anytime, anywhere and anyway. And we're working on things like enhanced search, enhanced checkout. We've got a comprehensive pricing tool that's going on out there for us, we can look at what the competitors are doing, even going as far as taking a look at what we're doing inside the stores to better take care of our customers, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. So there is a lot of things and a lot of capabilities that we have that we're working on and that also includes what we call the stockyard, which is a special order system in a number of our stores right now. So I guess, what I would tell you is that we're not sitting back, we're moving forward and we've got a plan to do just that. I know that was a long answer, but I wanted to make sure that I was comprehensive as I could be. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, I'll focus a little bit on the weather and ask the question – two part question. The first one is the West Coast mid-single digit comp pretty outstanding. I know that that region has been out-comping the rest of the store base for a while now. Can you just kind of remind us the spread between how the West has been performing versus the rest of the chain? And then, as the weather did improve, did all product categories improve in line with how you would expect, meaning do you see any area, Steve, specifically a weakness from a merchandising perspective that maybe you could do better in? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. This is Greg. I'll start off and I think Kurt and Steve may join. First of all, the Western region, as you know, we had a little bit of a slow start there in one state, but once the consumer recognized and understood who we were, we started seeing business accelerate. We don't typically comment on the basis points difference between West, East, North and South, so I'll kind of pun on that one. What I can tell you is that the West is doing quite well. I think there has been a real challenge in the retail environment in general, but our Western stores are performing very, very well. Now, there is more new stores in the West so – and I needed to make sure that you understand that caveat. I think they're less weather dependent as well, so that gives us a little bit of a benefit, and there's some things we're learning about the West, not only through the digital capabilities that we're also rolling out there, but how this consumer – their consumption, it's a large recline community. And I think for us, it's a little bit like the Deep South in Texas. We've got a consumer base out there that needs us, wants us to be there and they're engaging with us at a very high level. So, you'll see us continue to expand in the West eventually maybe talking about more distribution capability toward maybe the Seattle area at some point. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. And I would just add Matt that talking about the seasonal shift here, Greg talked earlier and so did Kurt about the softness we saw in January and February, and that really impacted a lot of our cold weather businesses. It was exciting and we thought we get into early spring and so we were quite nimble, we brought some receipts in early, and thought that we could capitalize on an early spring season similar to last year, but then the weather turned on us. Once we got into April, you would get, basically what you would expect. We saw the OPE lines start to ramp-up, a lot of our spring seasonal businesses take off, as well including grass seed. Now, we do have one less day in the second quarter, and that already took place in April. But if you look across the board, it's pretty much shaping up like you would expect for a spring season. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks. And Steve also kind of follow-up on that question with two parts. When you talk about April looking like a typical spring season, does that also imply it's back in that range plus 2% to plus 3%, that you're guiding for fiscal year 2017 or is it just an improvement from the minus 2% that we had in the first quarter? And then the other question, I want to see if you could answer, is on the original gross margin guidance of 25 basis points to 40 basis points for this year. I knew that the pricing optimization was part of the other margin driver that you're expecting. Do you think it's still a good environment to be pushing higher pricing in submarkets given the tepid demand? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Dan, this will be a two part answer, because I'll take a piece and Steve will take a piece. On the April trend moving forward, the only thing I can tell you is you said it, not me, yes we are in the range of where we forecasted for the year. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. And we're pleased with the initial response, but it's early. We are only 2.5 weeks in, but as we said before when you see what is shift, it can have a dramatic impact on some of these categories in our business. Steve, you want to talk about gross margin? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. I would just say that, Dan, we always talk about rate and share and there is a balance between the two. We are certainly not going to do anything that would put us in a position to be uncompetitive. So when you use a pricing tool and you've got upwards of 15,000 SKUs in the store, not all of them have the same level of elasticity. So we're going through – we're going to be very careful, very surgical in the way we use the tool. I would say at this point the tool is not cost us any share, if anything it's benefited us both ways, because we have come down on some prices and up on others and we will be very methodical on the use of that. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Petsense in terms of, is it meeting expectations, could you carve out what its sales might be approximately for the quarter? And then where in New York will that new distribution center be and when might it open? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. Well, that was about five questions and one there, Chuck. So I'll start off with Petsense. Very pleased with how the Petsense business is performing. As I said 2017 is a year of kind of the shakedown to understand the business more fully and to look at the expansion opportunities. So, we still think this is a company that has tremendous store count, as well as online and Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities, which we'll talk more about as we get further into the year. But Petsense is a winner, we're very excited about it and it's teaching us a few things about pet special that we can use also in Tractor. What else? Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC DC. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. DCs. DC is going to be, I think we've already made that announcement... Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yes. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Official, it's in Herkimer, New York. Frankfurt – Herkimer it's in that area, it's in that area, it's kind of a small town in Northern part of New York – but Northwestern New York. But the location was chosen because of its importance to helping us broaden our expansion capabilities as we add more stores into North. As you may know, and we talked about this a few calls back that we needed more capacity in the Northeast. The Hagerstown facilities and there are two of them are somewhat running at maximum. That facility will be fully functional at the end of 2018. So, don't expect us to – we'll start adding some stores in 2018 there, but 2018 into 2019 will be the final build outs as we move forward on for store base there. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Any numbers you could give us on what Petsense contributed to sales in the first quarter? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. We don't really break it out separately, and honestly Chuck, we don't do that for competitive reasons. So, as it grows to be a larger percentage, we'll talk more about that maybe later in the year first to next. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC All right. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray Hey, thanks for taking the question. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray Greg, I was wondering if you could comment, in the press release and in your prepared remarks, you referenced multiple times that retail landscape is changing rapidly. Could you provide maybe a little bit more perspective on that with the specifics and I assume it may be related to e-comm, but maybe you can enhance the detail? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. A couple of things that I would say to that, Peter, one is that we noticed in our own business about four years ago – four-and-a-half years ago, the amount of consumers that were coming to us through mobile devices, and we kept scratching our heads, on why is mobile so important. Well, as we talked about as a group and we went out with visiting stores, it's very simple. The landscape change, because that's the way our customer in the real community can communicate with us and that's how they really find product online. We see there's not a lot of broadband in a lot of these markets where we have stores. So, cell towers are easy and for them to use mobile was important, so we quickly started to mobilize everything that we do. The second thing we were learning is Buy Online Pickup in Store made a lot of sense to us as step one, versus that fulfillment, which we're already doing to Drop Ship and such through our Franklin facility and with a lot of vendor base that we have out there. But we said, our customers buy projects generally and they come in, they want to know that the product is there before they make the trip. Remember, they're traveling on average of 10 miles to 15 miles to get to our stores usually. So when we turned it on, we thought let's just watch and see and exactly what we thought was going to happen has happened and that was last fall, well I'm proud to say we've got to roll the entire chain in less than an eight-month period and it is driving our online business. It's also bringing customers in to four wall. And as I said in my comments, these customers are adding other things to the ticket. So, the ticket is starting to grow when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. And then, eventually we'll start to look at how we fulfill directly to consumers, as Steve and the team build out the network with the distribution centers, and we can start shipping direct, and not having to trying to fulfill out of one center. Now, the other thing that's changing in retail is you have to be available to the customer 24/7. It doesn't matter what time you open and close the physical store. The store is opened 24/7, and we realized that about four years ago, maybe even longer, and we've been working, and that's why we did to the replatforming, and I'm very excited about now our capabilities. And Rob's team has really brought us in very, very quickly and up to speed, and we're moving much, much faster than those in our segment. And having the capabilities of Buy Online Pickup in Store, direct fulfillment from a distribution centers and Drop Ship, being able to have mobile POS in our stores, we're testing right now, rolling out to more stores. What we like about that is, it gives us the ability to ring a sale to correct inventory, to answer a phone call, to do whatever, with one device throughout the entire store, it can even be a line buster, if we get a line of people, that can go in and use that device to basically ring the customers up. So, that's a wonderful tool, and the stores that are using it today are loving it. And I think we just about got a tool to the point, we're going to take it role to chain. And then the last thing is, the comment that Steve made about stockyard. And that's really the special order concept. It's really a kiosk that sits back at the customer service desk. It's a large screen, it's there for the customer. And what we're finding, customers are going there to place special orders, maybe large quantities of product that we already carry but, don't have enough in the store or a unique product that they can't find, but they can go on the screen with the help from one of our team members and we don't lose the sale. I'll give you an example. If we run an ad on Wednesday and Wednesday it breaks and Thursday, we sell out of an item, in the past, we'd have to tell a customer, we can give you a rain check, we don't have to do that any longer. Now we can say, listen just go to the kiosk, we'll go ahead and lock it in and that'll be coming to you in the next truck or will drop shipment to your premises. So all of these things are working in conjunction, and as Steve said before, it's ONETractor. So we've realized that, we have been moving very quickly over the last several years. We've probably just been more public with it over maybe the last six months to eight months. But we are clearly moving ahead of those in our segment and excited about what we see in front of us. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray Okay. Thanks. That's a great detail. I appreciate it. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking the question. My question is around the promotional activity you discussed. Can you just elaborate on that, and whether you think, it was effective? And then the second part of the question, sort of ties in just around deflation, which has been a drag. Is that purely just flowing through the impact from lower input cost or is there any evidence that maybe it's getting a little bit more competitive in some of the consumable categories? Thanks. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. And one of the things, we talk a lot about is, I mentioned it earlier about our ability to be nimble, and whether it'd be using our inventory or using things like promotion to take care of our business and making sure that we continue to keep share up. In the first quarter, we did a few things. We did a coupon online to see what kind of impact that might have and we tested that across the network, and the response was very favorable with our customers. We also did a few other little events that we thought might have an impact. I would tell you that, it wasn't material in terms of overall sales to the business. It did have a little bit of a margin erosion, but we've always talked a little bit about the fact that, we've got to make sure that we're using all of the arrows in our quiver. This would be one of the arrows that we used in Q1. I don't anticipate further promotion needing to be used throughout the remainder of the year based on last year's promotion, but we want to make sure that we've reserved the right to use it, if we need to. So that's what I will would tell you about promotion. In terms of deflation and Kurt and I may tag team this one. Typically the way we view that is input cost first, and then what our retail selling price is second. So, what you hear when we talk about deflation isn't us just selling at lower retails, it has to do first and foremost with the impact of commodities. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. No, I will just say I agree, because Steve hit that important point, Seth in that, it's the input costs that are a key part to that. So, our deflation calculation is not quoting situations where there maybe retail declines without a cost change. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Hi Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hey, Guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Hey, Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. So, I too have one question, but I'll make it part A and a part B. The part A, Greg I'd love to hear your thoughts on the private transaction in the Pets space last week, if – how you think about it, if you're expecting to see a more rational competitor, I'm not talking about the physical one, the digital one? And then my second question, and Greg, you mentioned there's been a lot of choppiness in the last year on comps, and the first quarter being no exception. We're kind of hearing from other retailers, we're hearing weather was a problem and then we're starting to see guidance that looks more normal for the second quarter. So given that the choppiness that you've seen, I guess, how do you get confidence in let's say, what a normalized run-rate looks like a 2%, 3% or 4%, and correct me if I'm wrong doesn't your comparison in this quarter you're in, doesn't it get tougher as the quarter goes on? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. All right. Let me first comment about – and let me not comment about the PetSmart Chewy scenario. All I can tell you there is that we keep our eyes and ears open to what's going on both online and in bricks-and-mortar. We think we have a powerful combination with Petsense and Tractor right now, and there is a lot of growth for us in Petsense to take that business digital and explode it. And in the local markets, where I can push from store delivery, it's going to be a huge advantage for us as we go forward. So, as far as the private transaction there, that's probably the only way that it could have happened, to be honest, because as a public company, I don't think that many people could have absorbed the hit in earnings. Moving on from that to the choppiness, and why do I feel, we've got a more normal looking setup for second quarter and maybe beyond, and yes, there's some challenges. Simeon, when you see the business respond as we had hoped in the early part of April that we didn't see happen in the first quarter, it gives us great confidence. We've been in this business, all of us, Steve's been here 19 years, I've been here 10 years, Kurt's been here 15-plus years, and the rest of the team, we're not rookies to this, we've seen this before. I can remember a year, when the weather didn't break until Memorial Day weekend, and we blew the numbers away for the entire year. It was just, we were off to the races and never looked back. So, I think we're a little less concerned now that we've seen the business open up, and it's more in line with what we had expected. But as I said before, this is not a linear path. We could see some coolness, some softness, but we really feel good about what we're seeing right now, and our inventory levels have really come down quickly because of the amount of sales that we generated in the first two-and-a-half weeks. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Simeon, Kurt. A couple things on that. So we continue to evaluate our long-term targets, and as just a reminder, our long-term targets that we've set is high single-digit total sales growth, which include some solid comp store sales in that picture. To Greg's point, one quarter of tough weather conditions or a couple of quarters there are not going to change our long-term targets. We still see the strength in the business, and our sales growth driving initiative ability to drive the high single-digit sales growth. One reminder is, when it comes to Q2, I think as was mentioned, in Q2, we do have one less comp sales day, that we know is part of the headwind that we're facing as part of Q2. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Hi, good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Recognizing that you don't want to update your full year guidance until the second quarter, to get to the low-end of the your previous 2% to 3% comp guidance for the year, you will need to do at least 3% comp for the next few quarters. And over the last four years, you've averaged an annual comp of 3.4% and you've acknowledged that this number benefited from the expansion of few big ticket sales, growth in energy markets and the impact of deflation. So aside from deflation getting less bad, what is going to get better in order for you to consistently put you in the comp range that's necessary in order to hit your standing guidance? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Michael. First as we said, given the seasonality of the business and the weather conditions in first quarter, we're not updating guidance at this time. Reminding that first quarter is the lowest volume sales and earnings quarter for that, that's the primary reason, it's about 15% of sales and earnings for the year. So at this point with being so early in the year and we recognize those factors that you brought up, at this point, it's just too early to give any guidance on the year. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Let me comment on, what needs to get better, Michael, okay. First of all, it's top-line sales, it's the categories that we didn't see response from in March this year that we saw in March last year, and we're seeing that. We also believe that the acceleration of our business in the digital space is feeding and fueling some of the things happening in the four wall store. We are talking with our consumer 24/7, they are interacting with us 24/7. As we learn, we reapply, Neighbor's Club has been a tremendous benefit from the standpoint of understanding this consumer better and being able to talk to them directly. And we're just getting really to start using some of that information. And then, I will tell you, we said it earlier, BOPIS has really been a wonderful addition to the business. What I like about is, it gives us both sides, it gives us the online component, it gives us the four wall component, and all we see for that is just continued acceleration. So there's a number of things, even within some product categories that Steve didn't mention, but he could, the things that we're starting to see work far better in some categories that maybe were a little more difficult the past two years, they're starting to open up again. And the energy markets down in Texas seemed to have settled down now and we're starting to see the movement back in those markets in sales. So, there is a lot of positive things that we see going forward, and that's why I would guess to say at this point, it's best to looking us at the halves not the quarters. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC And Greg, if I could just add one quick one? Because of the addition of Petsense, we can't calculate your new store productivity, what was your new store productivity in the first quarter and how does that compare to what it was last year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure, Michael. I'll take that one. Yeah, there is a couple of unique factors in the new store productivity calculation I understand that, so I'll give you a little bit of data points on there. So the unique items are the week shift and the impact it has on this year, so the week shift into a higher spring sales week also long without Petsense impact the new store productivity when you're looking at it from the external data that you have. Internally, as we adjust it for those two items, the first quarter new store productivity was slightly below the prior quarter, but nothing significant in that decline and I'll just tell you that the new store performance continues to be in line with our pro forma calculations and those new stores continue to contribute at an elevated comp consistent as what we've seen in the prior year. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC Good afternoon. I guess maybe I wanted to focus on the GURA right, the service initiative you have going on, maybe if you just comment Greg on how that process is going, what metrics you're looking at to measure the impact on service levels and sales? And then how has the one quarter shortfall impacted your plans to invest in labor and service this year, if at all? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Couple of things, Steve, I'm going to talk about is GURA, and its greet, uncover, recommend and ask. Our scores are climbing in that category. I would take that if John Ordus was speaking he would tell you that there is still more work to be done, but we are seeing a comparison year-over-year in a very positive direction. The second thing I would tell you is that we're protecting payroll in our stores. We all believe, as a management team that you can't call out great service when you have no one in the store to wait on the customer and take care of their needs. And so, we are going to take the route of making sure the payroll is protected, and making sure our stores can service our customers and that could be painful at times, but we know that, that is the longer-term goal, is to keep that customer service level at an all time high. And our S&G scores, which is the company we used to measure that are very accurate today and are telling us that that is paying off. So we believe it'll payoff in sales, particularly as we get into the peak season here in second quarter. And you know what, we'll be able to update you more in July when we get through the second quarter. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I also wanted to ask a multipart question on the comp. I guess, part one would be sort of around the in store initiatives and whether there is any initial uplift when Neighbor's Club comes and whether the incremental self space and Pet is helping? And then part two would be sort of about, how to think about the deferred sales that you have to have from 1Q, do you think that comes in ratably throughout the quarter or is that more sort of an out of the gates types of a dynamic? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. So, let me start Stephen, this is Steve, with the in-store initiatives and some of the things that we're doing. We did reset about a 1,000 stores in first quarter, in those stores they got the reset, we went up to 84-inch height. And really, the strategic area of our business in that is Pet. And you heard Kurt, and I believe, Greg both talk about the growth of our Pet business in Q1. I think we're going to get the benefit of that later in the year, because that reset happened about midway toward the back half of Q1. So, that's still in play, but we anticipate continued growth there. We tested it before we did it, so we had an ROI before we laid it out. The other thing I would tell you in store is that we had our most successful Chick Days event ever when you crossover the March/April timeframe. It was fantastic. We saw great growth in a lot of the accessories within Chick Days, whether it'd be the coops organic feed and treats. The Garden event is doing exceptionally well right now. And so, a lot of the efforts that we put into the initiatives in store have really from where I sit have paid off. The seasonal business was a drag, and it's unfortunate because it doesn't necessarily reflect the hard work nor the results that I would have expected. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Stephen, Kurt, I'll address the second part of it. And it might be helpful as a data point to refer back to our pull forward discussion from last year. At the end our Q1, we estimated that number at about $18 million. And then, as we reported Q2 and saw the results in April more information settled we estimated at about $25 million. To have it more of a comparable number for this year, with the week shift in moving that week into Q1, but April shifting to Q2, our estimate is for this quarter, it was about a $15 million deferral into the second quarter. How that plays out in the second quarter, weather as well as Easter timing plays into it, so some of that there in the first part of April, but the rest of it really can play into just as the weather hits in various spots, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. So I wouldn't say it's something that was immediate all in the first few weeks of April, it really plays more into the weather conditions in areas such as the North. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. And then just Neighbor's Club, is there an early lift on that or is that really more about the long-term in the data that you're collecting? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Again, this is Steve. I would tell you that and I've said this previously that if we didn't think that there was a lift, we wouldn't have rolled it out completely. We haven't gone into specifics around what that lift looks like, but we do believe there is a benefit, less in the short-run, although there is a benefit and certainly more in the long haul. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I had a short-term oriented question and then a longer one. First in, and I think you said that April is off to a good start. If you took a step back and looked at April and March combined, are you in positive territory or are you still negative, if you're going to kind of look at it that way, trying to even out some of the Easter shift in the weather? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Yes, Scott. Good question. I can't speak too specific to – specifically to those particular months. We would just say again that, we saw the March potential dissipate with the cold weather. And then I would just tell you, we've seen strong response from the consumer as the weather has turned more typical in April. At this point, that's the best I can give you. Too early in the quarter to try to give more specifics. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Because Easter should have really helped you guys out quite a bit, isn't that correct? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Well, keep in mind that Easter, we're closed on that day. So, we lose a day of sales, but certainly last year, we had the benefit of the Friday and Saturday before the Easter and we had that in April, so you do get those two days in April. And we have a strong add at that time that coincides as well. So, there is a planned expected strong sales performance in that particular time around Easter. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC And were you on plan? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. It's a good question. Scott, can't be any more specific. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. So, then I appreciate that. And then, so looking at a longer term question, I think it's something I've asked you guys before, but I want to kind of poke at it again. I mean, if I take a step back and just look at your same-store sales, yearly same-store sales, they really have been kind of down into the right since I think 2011. Each year, they're kind of peeling off just a little bit, and some years a little more, and I guess last year. What do you guys think is causing the kind of the slow decline? And obviously this year is not off to such a good start. I mean have you kind of pinpointed on what is a major drop from like I say mid-5% to now like last year 16%, what are the causes there and why do you think it will stop? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. This is Greg, I'll give a comment. I think, Steve and Kurt also say. First of all, there were tailwinds. No question, there were few tailwinds helping us. Inflation is a good thing. A few categories that had some tailwinds behind it saves and a few other things of that nature, which goes slowly kind of work their way off, okay, out of the comparable sales numbers. I don't believe – because we track this very closely with competitive intrusion, and we don't believe that it is anything that we had done to not refresh the business or bring newness to the business. I do believe, however, that the entire four wall retail businesses around the country and many segments have seen some decline. And maybe, we were part of some of that, but because I think the consumer has fallen in love with digital, which our consumer has as well. So, we have seen some shifting, as Steve mentioned earlier, we could see as much as 2% of our business this year bring down on the digital side. So there's been some shifting moving between four wall and digital, but in general I would tell you that some of those tailwinds became headwinds. And we didn't anticipate honestly the difficult business in the Texas, Oklahoma, and I'll call it the coldest regions as it's often due to the pullback in the oil markets, that was very, very difficult to overcome. Okay. That's been it (54:24) Operator And we do have our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Thanks. Good evening. I'm curious, I think you had talked in the past about a labor optimization that you were going to put in place in late 2017. Is it your expectation that you will roll that out in late 2017? And if so, do you expect to roll it out via test or all at once and what kind of impact might that have from the tail of the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Ben, I think what we talked about is that we were going to look at labor management and payroll management as kind of a combined or task management as a combined system, and we talked about starting it – hoping to start it in the fall of this year and running it into 2018 as a completion. So, we're still on task to do that, we have not chosen the final testing yet, but we plan to do that by midyear. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Okay. Great. And then if I could just one quick follow-up on the deflation, 50 basis points in the quarter I think for the year you had previously said you expected a range of 10 basis points to 30 basis points deflation. Is that still your expectation or keeping that higher-level deflation in 1Q, has that changed at all? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. I would say that we are seeing a little bit more of deflation than our original expectations. And we still believe that we're seeing signs that it would moderate in the back half of the year. So, as we saw 50 basis points in Q1, I would say our expectation on deflation is more like a 20 basis points to 30 basis point impact for the year, with that being closer to the high end of that range in Q2 and moderating in the back half. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator Next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks. Good evening. I had two quick follow-ups, so the 2% to 3% comp in April, does that include what sounds like a small headwind from the overall Easter shift? And then can you talk about the performance of the mature store cohort relative to chain and perhaps if you've isolated it along weather impacted and non-weather impacted markets like facing North versus South? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay, Chris. I'll address the first question there. Yeah, Easter is a headwind in that 2% to 3%. For the quarter, that is about a 60 basis point headwind on Q2, and the lost comp sales day for the year is about a 20 basis point impact for the year. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC And that 2% to 3%, that 60 basis points is like an annualized – the 2% to 3% is sort of netted at 60 basis points basically. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. That's right. It assumes and includes for the quarter a 60 basis point headwind on the quarter. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. And the second question, could you repeat the second question? Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC So the question is, can you talk about the performance of your mature stores versus I know the West is seeing some lift out of a younger store base out there. So how are the mature stores performing, and obviously you had some in weather impacted markets and some in not. So maybe the stores in the South where there was a lot less weather impacting the overall trend, those mature stores? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Yeah. Directionally, what we're seeing is that as we've said, the less mature stores have a faster high comp sales growth than the mature stores. And then – so there is somewhat of a gap between the 5 years or less stores in the mature ones. And consistent, at least looking at Q1, the mature stores were less than the less mature stores, but they behaved similar geographically. So when it comes to mature stores in the West to mature stores in the South, they outperformed the mature stores in the North. So there's somewhat of a gap between those, but they behaved very similar. And for the quarter, the mature stores had the same typical headwinds as the less mature store due to weather. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Understood. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wesbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Thanks a lot and good evening. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. How are you doing, Seth? Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Good. My question is around the gross margins. Just if you could provide a little more detail, maybe disaggregate the gross margin performance a bit more for this quarter between markdowns, promo and freight, and then provide some – a little bit more of color and expectations for which of these buckets will improve the most for you to achieve your guidance for over 25 basis points of improvement in gross margins down the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. For first quarter, the product rate being the clearance, markdown as well as any promos along with freight were the most impactful factors to margin. And then I would say, after that the headwind that we saw and knew we were cycling, but the next most impactful would've been cycling the benefit we got from the discounts for inventory related to new distribution center. The other headwinds that we described were of lesser impact. Specific to go forward, Q1 did have some unique items in there. So I'd first say that, the things that were unique to the first quarter such as cycling the vendor funding related to the inventory in the DC, the clearance on the winter seasonal goods and even to some extent the additional promotions that Steve talked to were unique to first quarter. However, we do see some greater headwinds than originally expected in freight. We had said that we saw – or expected freight to be about a 10 basis point headwind in 2017. Based on what we're seeing today, that's more closer to a 20 basis point headwind and then we do have a few other areas that mix particular that if we continue to grow strong in the C.U.E. items, mix will likely be a bit of a headwind for Q2 and potential for us go forward. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Got it. So, just to understand that 25 basis points to 30 basis point gross margin improvement for the year that guidance, is that still good or do you think there might be a little bit of downside risk to that based on freight and mix? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. And I would just say, again, we're not updating guidance, but I will say as I look to Q2 that it'll be more challenges, more headwind to try to achieving that range for Q2 than our original expectations. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Understood. Thank you and good luck. Operator Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Greg, I want to go back to some of the comments you made in your prepared comments, just with regard to the headwinds and tailwinds and specifically with respect to the C.U.E. business. So, overall, is C.U.E. still – as you think about that analysis, is C.U.E. still a tailwind to the business and maybe explain why there? Then with regard to Q1, it seemed – the color you gave us, it seemed that the C.U.E. sales held up well, so I wanted to confirm that, indeed did the C.U.E. sales help volume, and I guess, the question I'd ask there is, did the promotions and all help to drive better C.U.E. sales in Q1? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Brian, let me answer it this way. C.U.E. business is – the things that you'll find in our store at any given time of the year that makes sense for the customer that they buy in high volume and high quantity, hydraulic fluid, wood pellets, certain products in feed and food, so on and so forth. C.U.E. units continue to increase. So we feel good about our unit increase overall in the C.U.E. categories which tells us we're still taking share. However, deflation continues to play a major role in some of those C.U.E. categories. So, I've said this before, a bag of bird seed that was at one time we considered as a C.U.E. item in the first quarter that was selling for $19 to $22, is now selling for $16, let's say it as an example, due to deflation. Those are tough comparisons to offset. I've got to see another 30%-some-odd increase in units just to be able to offset last year's comparable volume. So there is where some of that quirkiness comes into play. But, we're very, very comfortable with C.U.E., we track it very closely. Steve and the team have a pulse on it, literally daily and we continue to see share – take share. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC Good evening, guys. I apologize, if this was asked before, because I was disconnected earlier. But I guess my question is, how should we think about the balance sheet going forward? Look I know this was a tough quarter, but we had AP'd inventory ratios fall pretty sharply. You guys are paying a dividend, you bought back a bunch of stocks, your debt levels have risen quite a bit. So I guess the question is, should we expect more debt to come on the balance sheet during the balance of the year, does that cause you potentially to pull back on your buyback program, because you don't want to add more debt? Or will the seasonal cash flow cadence that you're anticipating help reduce those cash needs? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Scot, I'll first start with – this quarter had some unique items. Steve mentioned the earlier spring seasonal buys. And so, with our effort in January, February, addressing what looked to be potentially be an early start to spring, we pulled some receipts forward. So in regards to the balance sheet on the AP and the inventory side, it's somewhat unique to the quarter in that, the growth in the inventory is fresh spring-related items. We pulled it forward that played into the timing of our payments, and so you see that on the balance sheet. To a lesser extent, one other thing that we faced in Q1, this one, we face whenever we have a 53rd week shift, the end of the quarter ended a week later, that does impact the timing of a key payables point to our merchant and rent vendors, and so you see a little bit of that drag compared to the prior quarter as well. In regards to debt, I would just say that we look at Q1 and Q3 as those peak particular times, and you're seeing with the uniqueness a heightened level of debt, we expect in Q2 for that to go back to normal levels. We've said we're targeting and comfortable with the 2 times debt leverage ratio and other than a few particular peak times, we see ourselves at about $400 million in debt – $450 million in debt at the end of the year. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Very helpful. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. And we don't expect at this point that to change any of our plan or cadence on capital allocation or dividend or share repurchase. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC Understood. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Thank you very much. With respect to the gross margin, Greg, you cited that e-commerce was a headwind on the gross margin. So assuming that e-comm continues to grow at a rate greater than your stores, what kind of level can we assume will be kind of a continuous gross margin headwind from the fact that you're growing e-comm at a greater rate? And then my second question is, I appreciate the color you provided with respect to the 600 basis point delta on a market basis as a result of the weather. I was curious if you can maybe segment that a different way and tell us how much in total that the oil patch states underperformed the rest of the corporate average? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Sure, Alan I'll take those. First in regards to the e-commerce and the gross margin, we called out the growth in e-commerce and its impact on freight. So, with our e-commerce business growing, it does have a higher freight rate and we've always had some level of burden, but e-commerce as small as it is, it's not had much of an impact, we are excited about the growth we have in the e-commerce business and we have seen a few basis points increase in the burden on the freight line within gross margin. So, we called it out. I believe that we'll see that continue in the future quarters. And as our e-commerce business grows, it could have a 1 basis points or 2 basis points impact throughout the year on the gross margin rate. And then – yeah, go ahead. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC No please. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC The delta on the oil patch? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Sure, sure. In regards to the oil patch, I'd first say that the Texas region like much of the South had less of an impact on weather. So, we did not see as much volatility in sales in the Texas area, but specific to the oil patch, as Greg mentioned, we see it moderating and in the quarter we had a close to 30 basis point headwind against the – 30 basis points headwind on the comps due to the oil patch stores. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator Next we have Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I thought if I could ask about BOPIS a little bit and then specifically to give us some examples, what types of categories or products you're seeing strong there, how this is incremental to current traffic? And then, similar to that, at the Analyst Day, I remember you speaking a little bit about potentially thinking about a subscription based program for some of the renewable C.U.E. based items, and what your sort of thought process is around that at the moment? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Adam, this is Steve. I would tell you that, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store, what we're finding is, is that our customers have an interest across the four walls. It's nothing in specific. In many cases, it's in multiples that they're buying. So it maybe fencing outside. It could be product that is on promotion for example, where they're maybe trying to reserve something, so they can get in and get the deal. But it's really across the entire spectrum of the four walls. So it's nothing that I can point to and say that 80% of what we're seeing there is one category or even a one side of the store. The second question was regarding the subscription. We talked about ONETractor and we talked about anytime, anywhere and anywhere customers want to shop a Tractor, and one of the capabilities that we're working on right now is subscription. It's one of many. And we fully anticipate making good traction on that throughout this year. And you will see us as we continue to talk with you all in these conference calls, we'll give you the traction that we're making, but it's definitely high on the list for us. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi. Just on the BOPIS answer just real quick if I could? So I'm unsure that in future, things that are already in the store and I imagine you generally having already high capture rate, the customers in your area, how it's actually incremental? I mean, would these people not becoming into the store to begin with to buy these things? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Well, I would tell you, it's two-prong. Yes, in some cases and I think if you would talk to most retailers, they would tell you that because I have certain retailers that I go to, that I would have gone to anyways and I use Buy Online Pickup in Store. But I would also tell you there has been several examples where we've modified our marketing budget in our spend there. And we have gone from what has been traditional over to digital, and buying SEM search words, we have found that customers are going in. I'll use the example of, the first Buy Online Pickup order that we had was actually a customer who was searching for trailers, and they never shopped at Tractor Supply before, searched the word, went on to our site, reviewed it, looked at the content, used Buy Online Pickup in Store and came in and bought two of them from us. So it's hard to pinpoint exactly who is using it, but I can tell you that we do believe it's a mix of both. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust. Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Yeah, hi. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Mitch on for David. Just ex-ing out the weather impact in the first quarter, how do you feel about big ticket demand in general? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. What I would say in regards to big ticket is, what we saw was the biggest headwind on the big ticket sales was the spring seasonal product. And so, I would say that big ticket demand was flat to potentially slightly positive, if you ex out the headwind that we're up against last year in the March spring seasonal. So big-ticket clearly became a stronger component of the average ticket in the month of March, as we cycled the strong spring seasonal and did not achieve those spring seasonal sales in Q1. Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Hey, guys. Yeah. Most of my questions were answered. I just want to follow-up on one other thing. Are there any new products that you guys have in the store or testing, I recall like a year ago, maybe like you tried some things with kayaks or something like outdoorsy or are there things that are maybe tangential to the business that, that maybe a way to drive additional traffic? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Joe, this is Steve. And I would tell you, we've been talking a lot about different digital things that we're doing and ways that we're attracting new customers in our stores, but there's also an opportunity with our existing customers base to sell them new and different things like you're mentioning. And so, for example this year, we've expanded beekeeping, because we know our customers are self-reliant, and that is an unique item that really is all about sustainability, that we've expanded our organic selection both in lawn and garden, as well as in our livestock feed section, and we're seeing incredibly nice comps there. A lot of the resets we've done in adding new brands, we're expanding 4health to customers, our outdoor sporting goods for example continues to grow. We've added it to more stores at this point. We're up to between 200 stores and 300 stores. We've expanded ammo, which is another key item for us, so we think our customers are looking for it. And I'll even go as far as to tell you that we're testing live crickets and worms in a lot of these sporting goods stores as well, to see if there's an interest or a demand from our customers. So there is a lot of things going on within the four walls themselves that should continue to drive that momentum that we've talked about in the past. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC That's great. Thank you for that and good luck with the quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. You mentioned before that you've got tools to look at competitor pricing now, so what are some of the key learnings so far and what opportunities do you see in pricing? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Denise, this is Steve again. I would tell you that's one of the capabilities right now that we're working on. When we talk about all the new things we're putting into and our capabilities for ONETractor. So while we have a tool out there today that is going out and web scraping for us and it's been effective for us for the most part, we've had that for now two years, I would tell you a more comprehensive tool that would give us more insight into more competitors and more SKUs will be much more beneficial as we move forward and I'll be able to give you more on that probably in the upcoming quarters. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks. And then just back to big ticket for a moment. It sounds like you're – it's like, excuse me, some kind of weather and timing impacts and things. If you could put it aside it sounds like you're actually a little bit more positive towards big ticket, so in the past when there has been big ticket cycle, how long did it last? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. The last part of the question is tough Denise, as it relates to weather. So, I'll let Steve maybe think about that, I want to see if he can go back in history. But I would tell you that generally big ticket is more significant in Q2 than it is in Q1 with the spring seasonal. And the only thing I did mention in the last time was the headwind of safes. And so, big ticket spring seasonal was the biggest headwind, outside of the weather, there would have been a little bit of a headwind still with the sluggishness of the safe sales. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Thanks so much. Operator This conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. Thank you everyone for your continued support and interest in Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking with you again in July regarding our second quarter results.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Thank you Our first question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird. Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I'll use my one on some of the online stuff. Thanks for some of the color on BOPIS. Any more metrics around kind of just how online sales – I know it's a small number for your guys, but how it's been growing, what percentage of the business it is? And then what else are you working on beyond Buy Online Pickup in Store, those types of things in order to better position the company for omnichannel selling in the years ahead? Thank you. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Peter, this is Steve Barbarick. And I would tell you, we've made a lot of advancements over the last couple of years and we continue to make traction as we go forward. To give you some bullets into the quarter and what we saw, our web visits were up about 26%. And what's also very exciting is that, if you look at the number of hits we've got the store locator, we had nearly 5 million hits to store locator for the quarter, which is up about 40%. So we know our customers are going online, they're not just looking at content or looking to buy, but also to look where our stores are located. Couple of other tit bits here that I would share with you. Our mobile traffic was over 60% and up to last year, and we continue to see Drop Ship as a real viable source for us. If you combine what we've done now direct-to-customer, as well as what we're seeing with Buy Online Pickup in Store, the early results, I will tell you, as we move into the back half of this year, I suspect for the full year we will be between probably 1% and 2% of sales, so we're seeing nice growth there. Then if you look at some of what we're doing in terms of capabilities, as Greg said, evolve to what customers needs, we talk a lot internally, and I think, we introduced this to you all at the Investor Meeting this concept of ONETractor. And it's really making sure we're taking the care of the customer anytime, anywhere and anyway. And we're working on things like enhanced search, enhanced checkout. We've got a comprehensive pricing tool that's going on out there for us, we can look at what the competitors are doing, even going as far as taking a look at what we're doing inside the stores to better take care of our customers, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. So there is a lot of things and a lot of capabilities that we have that we're working on and that also includes what we call the stockyard, which is a special order system in a number of our stores right now. So I guess, what I would tell you is that we're not sitting back, we're moving forward and we've got a plan to do just that. I know that was a long answer, but I wanted to make sure that I was comprehensive as I could be. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt McClintock with Barclays. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. I guess, I'll focus a little bit on the weather and ask the question – two part question. The first one is the West Coast mid-single digit comp pretty outstanding. I know that that region has been out-comping the rest of the store base for a while now. Can you just kind of remind us the spread between how the West has been performing versus the rest of the chain? And then, as the weather did improve, did all product categories improve in line with how you would expect, meaning do you see any area, Steve, specifically a weakness from a merchandising perspective that maybe you could do better in? Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. This is Greg. I'll start off and I think Kurt and Steve may join. First of all, the Western region, as you know, we had a little bit of a slow start there in one state, but once the consumer recognized and understood who we were, we started seeing business accelerate. We don't typically comment on the basis points difference between West, East, North and South, so I'll kind of pun on that one. What I can tell you is that the West is doing quite well. I think there has been a real challenge in the retail environment in general, but our Western stores are performing very, very well. Now, there is more new stores in the West so – and I needed to make sure that you understand that caveat. I think they're less weather dependent as well, so that gives us a little bit of a benefit, and there's some things we're learning about the West, not only through the digital capabilities that we're also rolling out there, but how this consumer – their consumption, it's a large recline community. And I think for us, it's a little bit like the Deep South in Texas. We've got a consumer base out there that needs us, wants us to be there and they're engaging with us at a very high level. So, you'll see us continue to expand in the West eventually maybe talking about more distribution capability toward maybe the Seattle area at some point. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. And I would just add Matt that talking about the seasonal shift here, Greg talked earlier and so did Kurt about the softness we saw in January and February, and that really impacted a lot of our cold weather businesses. It was exciting and we thought we get into early spring and so we were quite nimble, we brought some receipts in early, and thought that we could capitalize on an early spring season similar to last year, but then the weather turned on us. Once we got into April, you would get, basically what you would expect. We saw the OPE lines start to ramp-up, a lot of our spring seasonal businesses take off, as well including grass seed. Now, we do have one less day in the second quarter, and that already took place in April. But if you look across the board, it's pretty much shaping up like you would expect for a spring season. Matthew McClintock - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Wewer with Raymond James. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks. And Steve also kind of follow-up on that question with two parts. When you talk about April looking like a typical spring season, does that also imply it's back in that range plus 2% to plus 3%, that you're guiding for fiscal year 2017 or is it just an improvement from the minus 2% that we had in the first quarter? And then the other question, I want to see if you could answer, is on the original gross margin guidance of 25 basis points to 40 basis points for this year. I knew that the pricing optimization was part of the other margin driver that you're expecting. Do you think it's still a good environment to be pushing higher pricing in submarkets given the tepid demand? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Dan, this will be a two part answer, because I'll take a piece and Steve will take a piece. On the April trend moving forward, the only thing I can tell you is you said it, not me, yes we are in the range of where we forecasted for the year. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. And we're pleased with the initial response, but it's early. We are only 2.5 weeks in, but as we said before when you see what is shift, it can have a dramatic impact on some of these categories in our business. Steve, you want to talk about gross margin? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. I would just say that, Dan, we always talk about rate and share and there is a balance between the two. We are certainly not going to do anything that would put us in a position to be uncompetitive. So when you use a pricing tool and you've got upwards of 15,000 SKUs in the store, not all of them have the same level of elasticity. So we're going through – we're going to be very careful, very surgical in the way we use the tool. I would say at this point the tool is not cost us any share, if anything it's benefited us both ways, because we have come down on some prices and up on others and we will be very methodical on the use of that. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Petsense in terms of, is it meeting expectations, could you carve out what its sales might be approximately for the quarter? And then where in New York will that new distribution center be and when might it open? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. Well, that was about five questions and one there, Chuck. So I'll start off with Petsense. Very pleased with how the Petsense business is performing. As I said 2017 is a year of kind of the shakedown to understand the business more fully and to look at the expansion opportunities. So, we still think this is a company that has tremendous store count, as well as online and Buy Online Pickup in Store capabilities, which we'll talk more about as we get further into the year. But Petsense is a winner, we're very excited about it and it's teaching us a few things about pet special that we can use also in Tractor. What else? Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC DC. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. DCs. DC is going to be, I think we've already made that announcement... Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yes. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Official, it's in Herkimer, New York. Frankfurt – Herkimer it's in that area, it's in that area, it's kind of a small town in Northern part of New York – but Northwestern New York. But the location was chosen because of its importance to helping us broaden our expansion capabilities as we add more stores into North. As you may know, and we talked about this a few calls back that we needed more capacity in the Northeast. The Hagerstown facilities and there are two of them are somewhat running at maximum. That facility will be fully functional at the end of 2018. So, don't expect us to – we'll start adding some stores in 2018 there, but 2018 into 2019 will be the final build outs as we move forward on for store base there. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC Any numbers you could give us on what Petsense contributed to sales in the first quarter? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. We don't really break it out separately, and honestly Chuck, we don't do that for competitive reasons. So, as it grows to be a larger percentage, we'll talk more about that maybe later in the year first to next. Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC All right. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray Hey, thanks for taking the question. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray Greg, I was wondering if you could comment, in the press release and in your prepared remarks, you referenced multiple times that retail landscape is changing rapidly. Could you provide maybe a little bit more perspective on that with the specifics and I assume it may be related to e-comm, but maybe you can enhance the detail? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. A couple of things that I would say to that, Peter, one is that we noticed in our own business about four years ago – four-and-a-half years ago, the amount of consumers that were coming to us through mobile devices, and we kept scratching our heads, on why is mobile so important. Well, as we talked about as a group and we went out with visiting stores, it's very simple. The landscape change, because that's the way our customer in the real community can communicate with us and that's how they really find product online. We see there's not a lot of broadband in a lot of these markets where we have stores. So, cell towers are easy and for them to use mobile was important, so we quickly started to mobilize everything that we do. The second thing we were learning is Buy Online Pickup in Store made a lot of sense to us as step one, versus that fulfillment, which we're already doing to Drop Ship and such through our Franklin facility and with a lot of vendor base that we have out there. But we said, our customers buy projects generally and they come in, they want to know that the product is there before they make the trip. Remember, they're traveling on average of 10 miles to 15 miles to get to our stores usually. So when we turned it on, we thought let's just watch and see and exactly what we thought was going to happen has happened and that was last fall, well I'm proud to say we've got to roll the entire chain in less than an eight-month period and it is driving our online business. It's also bringing customers in to four wall. And as I said in my comments, these customers are adding other things to the ticket. So, the ticket is starting to grow when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store. And then, eventually we'll start to look at how we fulfill directly to consumers, as Steve and the team build out the network with the distribution centers, and we can start shipping direct, and not having to trying to fulfill out of one center. Now, the other thing that's changing in retail is you have to be available to the customer 24/7. It doesn't matter what time you open and close the physical store. The store is opened 24/7, and we realized that about four years ago, maybe even longer, and we've been working, and that's why we did to the replatforming, and I'm very excited about now our capabilities. And Rob's team has really brought us in very, very quickly and up to speed, and we're moving much, much faster than those in our segment. And having the capabilities of Buy Online Pickup in Store, direct fulfillment from a distribution centers and Drop Ship, being able to have mobile POS in our stores, we're testing right now, rolling out to more stores. What we like about that is, it gives us the ability to ring a sale to correct inventory, to answer a phone call, to do whatever, with one device throughout the entire store, it can even be a line buster, if we get a line of people, that can go in and use that device to basically ring the customers up. So, that's a wonderful tool, and the stores that are using it today are loving it. And I think we just about got a tool to the point, we're going to take it role to chain. And then the last thing is, the comment that Steve made about stockyard. And that's really the special order concept. It's really a kiosk that sits back at the customer service desk. It's a large screen, it's there for the customer. And what we're finding, customers are going there to place special orders, maybe large quantities of product that we already carry but, don't have enough in the store or a unique product that they can't find, but they can go on the screen with the help from one of our team members and we don't lose the sale. I'll give you an example. If we run an ad on Wednesday and Wednesday it breaks and Thursday, we sell out of an item, in the past, we'd have to tell a customer, we can give you a rain check, we don't have to do that any longer. Now we can say, listen just go to the kiosk, we'll go ahead and lock it in and that'll be coming to you in the next truck or will drop shipment to your premises. So all of these things are working in conjunction, and as Steve said before, it's ONETractor. So we've realized that, we have been moving very quickly over the last several years. We've probably just been more public with it over maybe the last six months to eight months. But we are clearly moving ahead of those in our segment and excited about what we see in front of us. Peter Jacob Keith - Piper Jaffray Okay. Thanks. That's a great detail. I appreciate it. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman with Credit Suisse. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thanks for taking the question. My question is around the promotional activity you discussed. Can you just elaborate on that, and whether you think, it was effective? And then the second part of the question, sort of ties in just around deflation, which has been a drag. Is that purely just flowing through the impact from lower input cost or is there any evidence that maybe it's getting a little bit more competitive in some of the consumable categories? Thanks. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Seth, this is Steve Barbarick. And one of the things, we talk a lot about is, I mentioned it earlier about our ability to be nimble, and whether it'd be using our inventory or using things like promotion to take care of our business and making sure that we continue to keep share up. In the first quarter, we did a few things. We did a coupon online to see what kind of impact that might have and we tested that across the network, and the response was very favorable with our customers. We also did a few other little events that we thought might have an impact. I would tell you that, it wasn't material in terms of overall sales to the business. It did have a little bit of a margin erosion, but we've always talked a little bit about the fact that, we've got to make sure that we're using all of the arrows in our quiver. This would be one of the arrows that we used in Q1. I don't anticipate further promotion needing to be used throughout the remainder of the year based on last year's promotion, but we want to make sure that we've reserved the right to use it, if we need to. So that's what I will would tell you about promotion. In terms of deflation and Kurt and I may tag team this one. Typically the way we view that is input cost first, and then what our retail selling price is second. So, what you hear when we talk about deflation isn't us just selling at lower retails, it has to do first and foremost with the impact of commodities. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. No, I will just say I agree, because Steve hit that important point, Seth in that, it's the input costs that are a key part to that. So, our deflation calculation is not quoting situations where there maybe retail declines without a cost change. Seth I. Sigman - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Hi Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hey, Guys. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Hey, Simeon. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. So, I too have one question, but I'll make it part A and a part B. The part A, Greg I'd love to hear your thoughts on the private transaction in the Pets space last week, if – how you think about it, if you're expecting to see a more rational competitor, I'm not talking about the physical one, the digital one? And then my second question, and Greg, you mentioned there's been a lot of choppiness in the last year on comps, and the first quarter being no exception. We're kind of hearing from other retailers, we're hearing weather was a problem and then we're starting to see guidance that looks more normal for the second quarter. So given that the choppiness that you've seen, I guess, how do you get confidence in let's say, what a normalized run-rate looks like a 2%, 3% or 4%, and correct me if I'm wrong doesn't your comparison in this quarter you're in, doesn't it get tougher as the quarter goes on? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. All right. Let me first comment about – and let me not comment about the PetSmart Chewy scenario. All I can tell you there is that we keep our eyes and ears open to what's going on both online and in bricks-and-mortar. We think we have a powerful combination with Petsense and Tractor right now, and there is a lot of growth for us in Petsense to take that business digital and explode it. And in the local markets, where I can push from store delivery, it's going to be a huge advantage for us as we go forward. So, as far as the private transaction there, that's probably the only way that it could have happened, to be honest, because as a public company, I don't think that many people could have absorbed the hit in earnings. Moving on from that to the choppiness, and why do I feel, we've got a more normal looking setup for second quarter and maybe beyond, and yes, there's some challenges. Simeon, when you see the business respond as we had hoped in the early part of April that we didn't see happen in the first quarter, it gives us great confidence. We've been in this business, all of us, Steve's been here 19 years, I've been here 10 years, Kurt's been here 15-plus years, and the rest of the team, we're not rookies to this, we've seen this before. I can remember a year, when the weather didn't break until Memorial Day weekend, and we blew the numbers away for the entire year. It was just, we were off to the races and never looked back. So, I think we're a little less concerned now that we've seen the business open up, and it's more in line with what we had expected. But as I said before, this is not a linear path. We could see some coolness, some softness, but we really feel good about what we're seeing right now, and our inventory levels have really come down quickly because of the amount of sales that we generated in the first two-and-a-half weeks. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Simeon, Kurt. A couple things on that. So we continue to evaluate our long-term targets, and as just a reminder, our long-term targets that we've set is high single-digit total sales growth, which include some solid comp store sales in that picture. To Greg's point, one quarter of tough weather conditions or a couple of quarters there are not going to change our long-term targets. We still see the strength in the business, and our sales growth driving initiative ability to drive the high single-digit sales growth. One reminder is, when it comes to Q2, I think as was mentioned, in Q2, we do have one less comp sales day, that we know is part of the headwind that we're facing as part of Q2. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Hi, good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Recognizing that you don't want to update your full year guidance until the second quarter, to get to the low-end of the your previous 2% to 3% comp guidance for the year, you will need to do at least 3% comp for the next few quarters. And over the last four years, you've averaged an annual comp of 3.4% and you've acknowledged that this number benefited from the expansion of few big ticket sales, growth in energy markets and the impact of deflation. So aside from deflation getting less bad, what is going to get better in order for you to consistently put you in the comp range that's necessary in order to hit your standing guidance? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Michael. First as we said, given the seasonality of the business and the weather conditions in first quarter, we're not updating guidance at this time. Reminding that first quarter is the lowest volume sales and earnings quarter for that, that's the primary reason, it's about 15% of sales and earnings for the year. So at this point with being so early in the year and we recognize those factors that you brought up, at this point, it's just too early to give any guidance on the year. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Let me comment on, what needs to get better, Michael, okay. First of all, it's top-line sales, it's the categories that we didn't see response from in March this year that we saw in March last year, and we're seeing that. We also believe that the acceleration of our business in the digital space is feeding and fueling some of the things happening in the four wall store. We are talking with our consumer 24/7, they are interacting with us 24/7. As we learn, we reapply, Neighbor's Club has been a tremendous benefit from the standpoint of understanding this consumer better and being able to talk to them directly. And we're just getting really to start using some of that information. And then, I will tell you, we said it earlier, BOPIS has really been a wonderful addition to the business. What I like about is, it gives us both sides, it gives us the online component, it gives us the four wall component, and all we see for that is just continued acceleration. So there's a number of things, even within some product categories that Steve didn't mention, but he could, the things that we're starting to see work far better in some categories that maybe were a little more difficult the past two years, they're starting to open up again. And the energy markets down in Texas seemed to have settled down now and we're starting to see the movement back in those markets in sales. So, there is a lot of positive things that we see going forward, and that's why I would guess to say at this point, it's best to looking us at the halves not the quarters. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC And Greg, if I could just add one quick one? Because of the addition of Petsense, we can't calculate your new store productivity, what was your new store productivity in the first quarter and how does that compare to what it was last year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure, Michael. I'll take that one. Yeah, there is a couple of unique factors in the new store productivity calculation I understand that, so I'll give you a little bit of data points on there. So the unique items are the week shift and the impact it has on this year, so the week shift into a higher spring sales week also long without Petsense impact the new store productivity when you're looking at it from the external data that you have. Internally, as we adjust it for those two items, the first quarter new store productivity was slightly below the prior quarter, but nothing significant in that decline and I'll just tell you that the new store performance continues to be in line with our pro forma calculations and those new stores continue to contribute at an elevated comp consistent as what we've seen in the prior year. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Forbes with Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC Good afternoon. I guess maybe I wanted to focus on the GURA right, the service initiative you have going on, maybe if you just comment Greg on how that process is going, what metrics you're looking at to measure the impact on service levels and sales? And then how has the one quarter shortfall impacted your plans to invest in labor and service this year, if at all? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Couple of things, Steve, I'm going to talk about is GURA, and its greet, uncover, recommend and ask. Our scores are climbing in that category. I would take that if John Ordus was speaking he would tell you that there is still more work to be done, but we are seeing a comparison year-over-year in a very positive direction. The second thing I would tell you is that we're protecting payroll in our stores. We all believe, as a management team that you can't call out great service when you have no one in the store to wait on the customer and take care of their needs. And so, we are going to take the route of making sure the payroll is protected, and making sure our stores can service our customers and that could be painful at times, but we know that, that is the longer-term goal, is to keep that customer service level at an all time high. And our S&G scores, which is the company we used to measure that are very accurate today and are telling us that that is paying off. So we believe it'll payoff in sales, particularly as we get into the peak season here in second quarter. And you know what, we'll be able to update you more in July when we get through the second quarter. Steven Forbes - Guggenheim Securities LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I also wanted to ask a multipart question on the comp. I guess, part one would be sort of around the in store initiatives and whether there is any initial uplift when Neighbor's Club comes and whether the incremental self space and Pet is helping? And then part two would be sort of about, how to think about the deferred sales that you have to have from 1Q, do you think that comes in ratably throughout the quarter or is that more sort of an out of the gates types of a dynamic? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. So, let me start Stephen, this is Steve, with the in-store initiatives and some of the things that we're doing. We did reset about a 1,000 stores in first quarter, in those stores they got the reset, we went up to 84-inch height. And really, the strategic area of our business in that is Pet. And you heard Kurt, and I believe, Greg both talk about the growth of our Pet business in Q1. I think we're going to get the benefit of that later in the year, because that reset happened about midway toward the back half of Q1. So, that's still in play, but we anticipate continued growth there. We tested it before we did it, so we had an ROI before we laid it out. The other thing I would tell you in store is that we had our most successful Chick Days event ever when you crossover the March/April timeframe. It was fantastic. We saw great growth in a lot of the accessories within Chick Days, whether it'd be the coops organic feed and treats. The Garden event is doing exceptionally well right now. And so, a lot of the efforts that we put into the initiatives in store have really from where I sit have paid off. The seasonal business was a drag, and it's unfortunate because it doesn't necessarily reflect the hard work nor the results that I would have expected. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Stephen, Kurt, I'll address the second part of it. And it might be helpful as a data point to refer back to our pull forward discussion from last year. At the end our Q1, we estimated that number at about $18 million. And then, as we reported Q2 and saw the results in April more information settled we estimated at about $25 million. To have it more of a comparable number for this year, with the week shift in moving that week into Q1, but April shifting to Q2, our estimate is for this quarter, it was about a $15 million deferral into the second quarter. How that plays out in the second quarter, weather as well as Easter timing plays into it, so some of that there in the first part of April, but the rest of it really can play into just as the weather hits in various spots, particularly in the Midwest and Northeast. So I wouldn't say it's something that was immediate all in the first few weeks of April, it really plays more into the weather conditions in areas such as the North. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. And then just Neighbor's Club, is there an early lift on that or is that really more about the long-term in the data that you're collecting? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Again, this is Steve. I would tell you that and I've said this previously that if we didn't think that there was a lift, we wouldn't have rolled it out completely. We haven't gone into specifics around what that lift looks like, but we do believe there is a benefit, less in the short-run, although there is a benefit and certainly more in the long haul. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understood. Thank you, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I had a short-term oriented question and then a longer one. First in, and I think you said that April is off to a good start. If you took a step back and looked at April and March combined, are you in positive territory or are you still negative, if you're going to kind of look at it that way, trying to even out some of the Easter shift in the weather? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Yes, Scott. Good question. I can't speak too specific to – specifically to those particular months. We would just say again that, we saw the March potential dissipate with the cold weather. And then I would just tell you, we've seen strong response from the consumer as the weather has turned more typical in April. At this point, that's the best I can give you. Too early in the quarter to try to give more specifics. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Because Easter should have really helped you guys out quite a bit, isn't that correct? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Well, keep in mind that Easter, we're closed on that day. So, we lose a day of sales, but certainly last year, we had the benefit of the Friday and Saturday before the Easter and we had that in April, so you do get those two days in April. And we have a strong add at that time that coincides as well. So, there is a planned expected strong sales performance in that particular time around Easter. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC And were you on plan? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. It's a good question. Scott, can't be any more specific. Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. So, then I appreciate that. And then, so looking at a longer term question, I think it's something I've asked you guys before, but I want to kind of poke at it again. I mean, if I take a step back and just look at your same-store sales, yearly same-store sales, they really have been kind of down into the right since I think 2011. Each year, they're kind of peeling off just a little bit, and some years a little more, and I guess last year. What do you guys think is causing the kind of the slow decline? And obviously this year is not off to such a good start. I mean have you kind of pinpointed on what is a major drop from like I say mid-5% to now like last year 16%, what are the causes there and why do you think it will stop? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. This is Greg, I'll give a comment. I think, Steve and Kurt also say. First of all, there were tailwinds. No question, there were few tailwinds helping us. Inflation is a good thing. A few categories that had some tailwinds behind it saves and a few other things of that nature, which goes slowly kind of work their way off, okay, out of the comparable sales numbers. I don't believe – because we track this very closely with competitive intrusion, and we don't believe that it is anything that we had done to not refresh the business or bring newness to the business. I do believe, however, that the entire four wall retail businesses around the country and many segments have seen some decline. And maybe, we were part of some of that, but because I think the consumer has fallen in love with digital, which our consumer has as well. So, we have seen some shifting, as Steve mentioned earlier, we could see as much as 2% of our business this year bring down on the digital side. So there's been some shifting moving between four wall and digital, but in general I would tell you that some of those tailwinds became headwinds. And we didn't anticipate honestly the difficult business in the Texas, Oklahoma, and I'll call it the coldest regions as it's often due to the pullback in the oil markets, that was very, very difficult to overcome. Okay. That's been it (54:24) Operator And we do have our next question from Ben Bienvenu from Stephens Inc. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Thanks. Good evening. I'm curious, I think you had talked in the past about a labor optimization that you were going to put in place in late 2017. Is it your expectation that you will roll that out in late 2017? And if so, do you expect to roll it out via test or all at once and what kind of impact might that have from the tail of the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Ben, I think what we talked about is that we were going to look at labor management and payroll management as kind of a combined or task management as a combined system, and we talked about starting it – hoping to start it in the fall of this year and running it into 2018 as a completion. So, we're still on task to do that, we have not chosen the final testing yet, but we plan to do that by midyear. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Okay. Great. And then if I could just one quick follow-up on the deflation, 50 basis points in the quarter I think for the year you had previously said you expected a range of 10 basis points to 30 basis points deflation. Is that still your expectation or keeping that higher-level deflation in 1Q, has that changed at all? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. I would say that we are seeing a little bit more of deflation than our original expectations. And we still believe that we're seeing signs that it would moderate in the back half of the year. So, as we saw 50 basis points in Q1, I would say our expectation on deflation is more like a 20 basis points to 30 basis point impact for the year, with that being closer to the high end of that range in Q2 and moderating in the back half. Benjamin Bienvenu - Stephens, Inc. Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator Next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks. Good evening. I had two quick follow-ups, so the 2% to 3% comp in April, does that include what sounds like a small headwind from the overall Easter shift? And then can you talk about the performance of the mature store cohort relative to chain and perhaps if you've isolated it along weather impacted and non-weather impacted markets like facing North versus South? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay, Chris. I'll address the first question there. Yeah, Easter is a headwind in that 2% to 3%. For the quarter, that is about a 60 basis point headwind on Q2, and the lost comp sales day for the year is about a 20 basis point impact for the year. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC And that 2% to 3%, that 60 basis points is like an annualized – the 2% to 3% is sort of netted at 60 basis points basically. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. That's right. It assumes and includes for the quarter a 60 basis point headwind on the quarter. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. And the second question, could you repeat the second question? Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC So the question is, can you talk about the performance of your mature stores versus I know the West is seeing some lift out of a younger store base out there. So how are the mature stores performing, and obviously you had some in weather impacted markets and some in not. So maybe the stores in the South where there was a lot less weather impacting the overall trend, those mature stores? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Yeah. Directionally, what we're seeing is that as we've said, the less mature stores have a faster high comp sales growth than the mature stores. And then – so there is somewhat of a gap between the 5 years or less stores in the mature ones. And consistent, at least looking at Q1, the mature stores were less than the less mature stores, but they behaved similar geographically. So when it comes to mature stores in the West to mature stores in the South, they outperformed the mature stores in the North. So there's somewhat of a gap between those, but they behaved very similar. And for the quarter, the mature stores had the same typical headwinds as the less mature store due to weather. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Understood. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Basham with Wesbush Securities. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Thanks a lot and good evening. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. How are you doing, Seth? Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Good. My question is around the gross margins. Just if you could provide a little more detail, maybe disaggregate the gross margin performance a bit more for this quarter between markdowns, promo and freight, and then provide some – a little bit more of color and expectations for which of these buckets will improve the most for you to achieve your guidance for over 25 basis points of improvement in gross margins down the year? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. For first quarter, the product rate being the clearance, markdown as well as any promos along with freight were the most impactful factors to margin. And then I would say, after that the headwind that we saw and knew we were cycling, but the next most impactful would've been cycling the benefit we got from the discounts for inventory related to new distribution center. The other headwinds that we described were of lesser impact. Specific to go forward, Q1 did have some unique items in there. So I'd first say that, the things that were unique to the first quarter such as cycling the vendor funding related to the inventory in the DC, the clearance on the winter seasonal goods and even to some extent the additional promotions that Steve talked to were unique to first quarter. However, we do see some greater headwinds than originally expected in freight. We had said that we saw – or expected freight to be about a 10 basis point headwind in 2017. Based on what we're seeing today, that's more closer to a 20 basis point headwind and then we do have a few other areas that mix particular that if we continue to grow strong in the C.U.E. items, mix will likely be a bit of a headwind for Q2 and potential for us go forward. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Got it. So, just to understand that 25 basis points to 30 basis point gross margin improvement for the year that guidance, is that still good or do you think there might be a little bit of downside risk to that based on freight and mix? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. And I would just say, again, we're not updating guidance, but I will say as I look to Q2 that it'll be more challenges, more headwind to try to achieving that range for Q2 than our original expectations. Seth M. Basham - Wedbush Securities, Inc. Understood. Thank you and good luck. Operator Our next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. So, Greg, I want to go back to some of the comments you made in your prepared comments, just with regard to the headwinds and tailwinds and specifically with respect to the C.U.E. business. So, overall, is C.U.E. still – as you think about that analysis, is C.U.E. still a tailwind to the business and maybe explain why there? Then with regard to Q1, it seemed – the color you gave us, it seemed that the C.U.E. sales held up well, so I wanted to confirm that, indeed did the C.U.E. sales help volume, and I guess, the question I'd ask there is, did the promotions and all help to drive better C.U.E. sales in Q1? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Brian, let me answer it this way. C.U.E. business is – the things that you'll find in our store at any given time of the year that makes sense for the customer that they buy in high volume and high quantity, hydraulic fluid, wood pellets, certain products in feed and food, so on and so forth. C.U.E. units continue to increase. So we feel good about our unit increase overall in the C.U.E. categories which tells us we're still taking share. However, deflation continues to play a major role in some of those C.U.E. categories. So, I've said this before, a bag of bird seed that was at one time we considered as a C.U.E. item in the first quarter that was selling for $19 to $22, is now selling for $16, let's say it as an example, due to deflation. Those are tough comparisons to offset. I've got to see another 30%-some-odd increase in units just to be able to offset last year's comparable volume. So there is where some of that quirkiness comes into play. But, we're very, very comfortable with C.U.E., we track it very closely. Steve and the team have a pulse on it, literally daily and we continue to see share – take share. Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC Good evening, guys. I apologize, if this was asked before, because I was disconnected earlier. But I guess my question is, how should we think about the balance sheet going forward? Look I know this was a tough quarter, but we had AP'd inventory ratios fall pretty sharply. You guys are paying a dividend, you bought back a bunch of stocks, your debt levels have risen quite a bit. So I guess the question is, should we expect more debt to come on the balance sheet during the balance of the year, does that cause you potentially to pull back on your buyback program, because you don't want to add more debt? Or will the seasonal cash flow cadence that you're anticipating help reduce those cash needs? Thanks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Scot, I'll first start with – this quarter had some unique items. Steve mentioned the earlier spring seasonal buys. And so, with our effort in January, February, addressing what looked to be potentially be an early start to spring, we pulled some receipts forward. So in regards to the balance sheet on the AP and the inventory side, it's somewhat unique to the quarter in that, the growth in the inventory is fresh spring-related items. We pulled it forward that played into the timing of our payments, and so you see that on the balance sheet. To a lesser extent, one other thing that we faced in Q1, this one, we face whenever we have a 53rd week shift, the end of the quarter ended a week later, that does impact the timing of a key payables point to our merchant and rent vendors, and so you see a little bit of that drag compared to the prior quarter as well. In regards to debt, I would just say that we look at Q1 and Q3 as those peak particular times, and you're seeing with the uniqueness a heightened level of debt, we expect in Q2 for that to go back to normal levels. We've said we're targeting and comfortable with the 2 times debt leverage ratio and other than a few particular peak times, we see ourselves at about $400 million in debt – $450 million in debt at the end of the year. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Very helpful. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. And we don't expect at this point that to change any of our plan or cadence on capital allocation or dividend or share repurchase. Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Markets LLC Understood. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with BTIG. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Thank you very much. With respect to the gross margin, Greg, you cited that e-commerce was a headwind on the gross margin. So assuming that e-comm continues to grow at a rate greater than your stores, what kind of level can we assume will be kind of a continuous gross margin headwind from the fact that you're growing e-comm at a greater rate? And then my second question is, I appreciate the color you provided with respect to the 600 basis point delta on a market basis as a result of the weather. I was curious if you can maybe segment that a different way and tell us how much in total that the oil patch states underperformed the rest of the corporate average? Thank you. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Sure, Alan I'll take those. First in regards to the e-commerce and the gross margin, we called out the growth in e-commerce and its impact on freight. So, with our e-commerce business growing, it does have a higher freight rate and we've always had some level of burden, but e-commerce as small as it is, it's not had much of an impact, we are excited about the growth we have in the e-commerce business and we have seen a few basis points increase in the burden on the freight line within gross margin. So, we called it out. I believe that we'll see that continue in the future quarters. And as our e-commerce business grows, it could have a 1 basis points or 2 basis points impact throughout the year on the gross margin rate. And then – yeah, go ahead. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC No please. Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC The delta on the oil patch? Kurt D. Barton - Tractor Supply Co. Sure, sure. In regards to the oil patch, I'd first say that the Texas region like much of the South had less of an impact on weather. So, we did not see as much volatility in sales in the Texas area, but specific to the oil patch, as Greg mentioned, we see it moderating and in the quarter we had a close to 30 basis point headwind against the – 30 basis points headwind on the comps due to the oil patch stores. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator Next we have Adam Sindler with Deutsche Bank. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I thought if I could ask about BOPIS a little bit and then specifically to give us some examples, what types of categories or products you're seeing strong there, how this is incremental to current traffic? And then, similar to that, at the Analyst Day, I remember you speaking a little bit about potentially thinking about a subscription based program for some of the renewable C.U.E. based items, and what your sort of thought process is around that at the moment? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Adam, this is Steve. I would tell you that, when it comes to Buy Online Pickup in Store, what we're finding is, is that our customers have an interest across the four walls. It's nothing in specific. In many cases, it's in multiples that they're buying. So it maybe fencing outside. It could be product that is on promotion for example, where they're maybe trying to reserve something, so they can get in and get the deal. But it's really across the entire spectrum of the four walls. So it's nothing that I can point to and say that 80% of what we're seeing there is one category or even a one side of the store. The second question was regarding the subscription. We talked about ONETractor and we talked about anytime, anywhere and anywhere customers want to shop a Tractor, and one of the capabilities that we're working on right now is subscription. It's one of many. And we fully anticipate making good traction on that throughout this year. And you will see us as we continue to talk with you all in these conference calls, we'll give you the traction that we're making, but it's definitely high on the list for us. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi. Just on the BOPIS answer just real quick if I could? So I'm unsure that in future, things that are already in the store and I imagine you generally having already high capture rate, the customers in your area, how it's actually incremental? I mean, would these people not becoming into the store to begin with to buy these things? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Sure. Well, I would tell you, it's two-prong. Yes, in some cases and I think if you would talk to most retailers, they would tell you that because I have certain retailers that I go to, that I would have gone to anyways and I use Buy Online Pickup in Store. But I would also tell you there has been several examples where we've modified our marketing budget in our spend there. And we have gone from what has been traditional over to digital, and buying SEM search words, we have found that customers are going in. I'll use the example of, the first Buy Online Pickup order that we had was actually a customer who was searching for trailers, and they never shopped at Tractor Supply before, searched the word, went on to our site, reviewed it, looked at the content, used Buy Online Pickup in Store and came in and bought two of them from us. So it's hard to pinpoint exactly who is using it, but I can tell you that we do believe it's a mix of both. Adam H. Sindler - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. Operator Your next question comes from David Magee with SunTrust. Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Yeah, hi. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Mitch on for David. Just ex-ing out the weather impact in the first quarter, how do you feel about big ticket demand in general? Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. What I would say in regards to big ticket is, what we saw was the biggest headwind on the big ticket sales was the spring seasonal product. And so, I would say that big ticket demand was flat to potentially slightly positive, if you ex out the headwind that we're up against last year in the March spring seasonal. So big-ticket clearly became a stronger component of the average ticket in the month of March, as we cycled the strong spring seasonal and did not achieve those spring seasonal sales in Q1. Mitch van Zelfden - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC Hey, guys. Yeah. Most of my questions were answered. I just want to follow-up on one other thing. Are there any new products that you guys have in the store or testing, I recall like a year ago, maybe like you tried some things with kayaks or something like outdoorsy or are there things that are maybe tangential to the business that, that maybe a way to drive additional traffic? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah. Joe, this is Steve. And I would tell you, we've been talking a lot about different digital things that we're doing and ways that we're attracting new customers in our stores, but there's also an opportunity with our existing customers base to sell them new and different things like you're mentioning. And so, for example this year, we've expanded beekeeping, because we know our customers are self-reliant, and that is an unique item that really is all about sustainability, that we've expanded our organic selection both in lawn and garden, as well as in our livestock feed section, and we're seeing incredibly nice comps there. A lot of the resets we've done in adding new brands, we're expanding 4health to customers, our outdoor sporting goods for example continues to grow. We've added it to more stores at this point. We're up to between 200 stores and 300 stores. We've expanded ammo, which is another key item for us, so we think our customers are looking for it. And I'll even go as far as to tell you that we're testing live crickets and worms in a lot of these sporting goods stores as well, to see if there's an interest or a demand from our customers. So there is a lot of things going on within the four walls themselves that should continue to drive that momentum that we've talked about in the past. Joseph Isaac Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC That's great. Thank you for that and good luck with the quarter. Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Denise Chai with Bank of America. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. You mentioned before that you've got tools to look at competitor pricing now, so what are some of the key learnings so far and what opportunities do you see in pricing? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. Yeah, Denise, this is Steve again. I would tell you that's one of the capabilities right now that we're working on. When we talk about all the new things we're putting into and our capabilities for ONETractor. So while we have a tool out there today that is going out and web scraping for us and it's been effective for us for the most part, we've had that for now two years, I would tell you a more comprehensive tool that would give us more insight into more competitors and more SKUs will be much more beneficial as we move forward and I'll be able to give you more on that probably in the upcoming quarters. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thanks. And then just back to big ticket for a moment. It sounds like you're – it's like, excuse me, some kind of weather and timing impacts and things. If you could put it aside it sounds like you're actually a little bit more positive towards big ticket, so in the past when there has been big ticket cycle, how long did it last? Steve K. Barbarick - Tractor Supply Co. The last part of the question is tough Denise, as it relates to weather. So, I'll let Steve maybe think about that, I want to see if he can go back in history. But I would tell you that generally big ticket is more significant in Q2 than it is in Q1 with the spring seasonal. And the only thing I did mention in the last time was the headwind of safes. And so, big ticket spring seasonal was the biggest headwind, outside of the weather, there would have been a little bit of a headwind still with the sluggishness of the safe sales. Denise Sara Chai - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Thanks so much. Operator This conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks. Gregory A. Sandfort - Tractor Supply Co. Okay. Thank you everyone for your continued support and interest in Tractor Supply. We look forward to speaking with you again in July regarding our second quarter results.

Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments first quarter 2017 earnings release conference call. Today's call is being recorded, and at this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Good afternoon, and thank you for joining our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Rafael Lizardi, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. I'll start with a quick summary of our financial results. Revenue for the first quarter increased 13% from a year ago. Demand for our products continue to be strong in the automotive market and continued to strengthen in the industrial market. Personal electronics also grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter. In our core businesses, Analog revenue grew 20% and Embedded Processing revenue grew 10% compared with the same quarter a year ago. Operating margin increased in both businesses. Earnings per share were $0.97 which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit not in our original guidance. With that backdrop, I'll provide details on our performance, which we believe continues to be representative of the ongoing strength of TI's business model. In the first quarter, our cash flow from operations was $795 million, and we believe that free cash flow growth, especially on a per share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term. Free cash flow for the trailing 12-month period was $4.2 billion, up 11% from a year ago. Free cash flow margin was 30.7% of revenue, up from 29.5% a year ago. We continue to benefit from our improved product portfolio that is long-lived and diverse, and the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, the latter of which includes our growing 300-millimeter analog output and our opportunistic purchase of assets ahead of demand. We believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's productively invested in the business or returned to owners. For the trailing 12-month period, we returned $3.8 billion of cash to owners through a combination of dividends and stock repurchases. From a year ago, Analog revenue increased 20% due to growth in all three product lines, power, signal chain and high volume. Embedded Processing revenue increased by 10% from a year ago due to growth in both product lines, processors and connected microcontrollers by about the same amount. In our other segment, revenue declined $57 million from a year ago, primarily due to a move of royalties to OI&E, which Rafael will explain later. Now I'll provide some insight into this quarter's revenue performance by end market versus a year ago. Automotive demand remains strong with most sectors growing double digits. Industrial demand continued to strengthen with broad-based growth. Personal electronics grew compared with a weak year-ago quarter. Communications equipment grew slightly from the year-ago and sequential periods. And then lastly, enterprise systems declined. We continue to focus our strategy on the industrial and automotive markets, which are where we have been allocating our capital and driving initiatives. This is based on a belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest growing semiconductor markets due to their increasing semiconductor content, and that they will provide diversity and longevity of products which translates to a high terminal value of the portfolio. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.14 billion or 63% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit increased primarily due to higher revenue. Gross profit margin increased 220 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $808 million or 23.8% of revenue, and on a trailing 12-month basis, they were 22.8% of revenue, in the lower half of our model. Over the last 12 months, we have invested $1.4 billion in R&D, an important element of our capital allocation. Acquisition charges were $80 million, all of which was the ongoing amortization of intangibles, which is a non-cash expense. Operating profit was $1.25 billion, or 36.8% of revenue. Operating profit was up 27% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin for Analog was 41.4%, up from 36.6% a year ago. Embedded Processing was 29.9%, up from 25.7% a year ago. Our focused investments on the best sustainable growth opportunities with differentiated positions enable both businesses to continue to contribute nicely to free cash flow growth. Net income in the first quarter was $997 million or $0.97 per share, which included an additional $0.08 discrete tax benefit that was not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $795 million in the quarter. Inventory days were 132, consistent with our long-term model of 105 to 135 days. Capital expenditures were $127 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, cash flow from operations was $4.76 billion, up 9% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $534 million or 4% of revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectation for capital expenditures is about 4% of revenue. Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $4.22 billion or 30.7% of revenue. Free cash flow was 11% higher than a year ago. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe free cash flow growth, especially on a per-share basis, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long term and will be valued only if it is productively invested in the business or returned to owners. In the first quarter, we paid $500 million in dividends and repurchased $550 million of our own stock for a total return of $1.05 billion. Total cash returned to owners in the past 12 months was $3.82 billion. These combined returns demonstrate our confidence in our business model and our commitment to return excess cash to our owners. Over the last 12 months, we paid $1.76 billion in dividends or 42% of trailing 12-month free cash flow, which demonstrates the affordability and sustainability of our dividend growth. Outstanding share count was reduced by 1% over the past 12 months and has been reduced by 42% since the end of 2004, when we initiated a program designed to reduce our share count. In fact, we have reduced shares every quarter year on year for 52 consecutive quarters. In March, we retired $250 million of debt. This leaves total debt of $3.375 billion with a weighted average coupon rate of 2.32%. Our cash management and tax practices are fundamental to our commitment to return cash. We ended the first quarter with $3.05 billion of cash and short-term investments, with our U.S. entities owning about 80% of our cash. This onshore cash is readily available for multiple uses. Turning to our outlook for second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.7 billion and earnings per share in the range of $0.89 to $1.01, which includes an estimated $30 million discrete tax benefit. Before moving to Q&A, there are three changes that I want to explain to help you better understand our first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. The first is to remind you that in the fourth quarter of 2016, we adopted a new GAAP standard that impacts the accounting of taxes for stock-based compensation. While this adoption has no impact on our cash balance, it does result in a discrete tax item that impacts our effective tax rate and earnings per share. To help you model the tax rate and discrete tax items, I am sharing the quarterly assumptions and their impact. We will continue to report how our results differ from our guidance just as we did this quarter. To start with, our operating tax rate for 2017 is estimated to be about 30%, unchanged from previous guidance. This operating tax rate assumes no discrete items and it's what you will need to use as a starting point for your longer term models. Next, we are assuming discrete tax items of about $30 million, $20 million and $10 million in the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2017 respectively. Therefore, the effective tax rates which include discrete tax items translate to about 28%, 29% and 30% in the second, third and fourth quarters respectively. These are the quarterly effective tax rates you should use for your 2017 models. If you do the math using these numbers, you will get an effective tax rate of 27% for the year. I advise you not to use 27% in any quarter as the size of discrete tax items vary quarter to quarter, particularly in first quarter. We will post a chart summarizing our assumptions for these discrete tax items as well as the retrospective impact of this new standard on our website at ti.com/ir. Hopefully providing these discrete tax item assumptions will be a good start in dealing with this new accounting standard. The second item is a GAAP standard that we adopted in the first quarter of 2017 that requires us to report certain pension costs in other income and expense, or OI&E, that were previously reported in OpEx and cost of revenue. This change is small, typically about $15 million of costs in a quarter, with about 70% coming out of OpEx and the balance out of cost of revenue. A chart summarizing these changes and their retrospective impact will be available on our website The last change is also effective first quarter of 2017 and impacts how we handle royalties. We will no longer recognize royalties in revenue. Instead, they will be recorded as income in other income and expense. As Analog and Embedded have become a much larger part of the company, royalties now represent a little less than 1% of our overall revenue. They were about $30 million in the first quarter of 2017, about what they were a year ago. We expect royalties to continue to run generally at about this level for many years into the future. However, given their decreasing significance to our core operations, they are now recorded as other income and expense rather than in revenue as of our first quarter 2017 results. I'm hopeful that spending some extra time talking through these accounting details will help you in understanding our results Now to wrap up, we remain focused on growing free cash flow per share over the long term and investing to strengthen our competitive advantages. We believe our first quarter results continue to demonstrate our progress. With that, let me turn it back to Dave. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Thanks, Rafael. Operator, you can now open up the lines for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow-up. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. At this time, we'll take our first question in the queue. This will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. From a product and end market perspective, it appears that demand is relatively broad based. I'm wondering if you can comment on demand by geographies. I'm assuming that that's also fairly broad based as well, but wanted to see if there were any regions which are exhibiting any weakness. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, Harlan. Yes, I would say that the demand was very broad based and included regionals. Year over year, revenue was up in Asia, Europe and the U.S. And revenue was about even in Japan from a year ago. You have a follow up? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Auto, a solid market for the team last year with that end market up 23%. I think you mentioned that it's up double digits again in March. You've got a very diversified business here as well. There's been some concern around the global auto markets and the potential for a slowdown, given indications that production and/or demand after two solid years might start to slow. Just wanted to get the team's sense on the health of this market kind of near to midterm. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. I definitely, as we stated in the opening remarks, that we saw our demand for our products in automotive continued to be strong. And so like you said, we've built that business across a very diverse set of sectors. And in fact, we've got five sectors inside of automotive. So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive. And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1%, or a little more than 1% of the sales price of a car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year timeframe have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's we continue to invest in it, and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Thanks, Harlan. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask about OpEx. Did that come in in line with your original plan for the quarter or was it different? And how should we think about the OpEx trajectory into Q2? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. Thanks for the call. I'll handle that one. On OpEx, everything came in about as expected. What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx, high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half. And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that. So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines. If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level first to second, I would remind you that second quarter does have three months of higher pay and benefit raises versus only two months in first quarter. So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Do you have a follow-on, Stacy? Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, yes I do. On your capital management update from a month or two ago, you had given some indicators of where 300-millimeter loading was, but it only went up a little bit in 2016. I think it went from about $2.2 billion year over year to $2.5 billion, so maybe $300 million, suggesting a good amount of headroom left for that transition to continue. How should we expect that trajectory to evolve this year in 2017? Is it just dependent on growth? Is there volume in 200-millimeter that's ramping down as 300-millimeter is ramping up? Like how should we think about where that might end up exiting this year in a normal demand environment? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yeah, Stacy, in the capital management update, if you remember, we talked about the fact that we've put in place about $8 billion of 300-millimeter capacity. Last year we had, as you stated, about $2.5 billion, so we're in a great position to be able to support growth. And essentially, we've been releasing for sometime now really probably going back to 2010, almost all of our new Analog products to 300-millimeter. So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter. And if you look at last year, that came pretty close to what happened. So we had about $300 million of growth, so it's very consistent with that. So, thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, you were kind enough in your prepared comments to go through end markets in the March quarter on a year over year basis. I think the comm equipment was the only market you gave sequential color. I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about the sequential growth into March. It was well above seasonal and sort of in the same vein, to your guidance in June, you're guiding below seasonal. So how should we think about that from an end market perspective? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. So a couple of things. We thought the comms equipment market has been choppy in recent past, so we thought that that would be helpful, and that's why we provided it. If I'd just comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong. It increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we ship into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that fit inside of that. So it's very, very broad based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even. So, when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggests that it would be up 9%. And if you look at that, John, on a year on year basis, the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%. So we think that that's fairly robust growth inside of the second quarter. So you have a follow-on, John? John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yes, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-on, I might have missed this and I apologize, but did you give an orders number for the quarter? And just in general, how are lead times either of your products or your competitors' products, because there has been some buzz that perhaps lead times within the industry are starting to stretch out? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. So orders were up 14% year on year to $3.5 billion. They were up about 2% sequentially. And I think from a lead time standpoint, our lead times have remained stable. And just as important as that, our on-time delivery metrics also remain very high. So our shipping to our commitments that we make to customers remain very high. So with that said, we do have some isolated process and package combinations where lead times have stretched, but we've worked very aggressively on those. So we're very pleased with where we are to be able to keep ahead of demand. Well thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on inventory, Dave. I guess exiting the quarter, inventory days were at 132 days, toward the high end of your guided range. How comfortable are you with that level? And what are you seeing in terms of the distribution channel? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, we are – well, I'll answer our inventory days and then I'll let Dave comment on the disti channel. But we're comfortable with our inventory days. It's well within our range. Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth. And the other key point to remember is as we have focused our strategy more on industrial, automotive and on catalog type of parts, the risk of obsolescence on this part is really minimal. So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, and from a disti standpoint, Toshiya, we saw our inventory days kind of remain near their current levels, at four weeks. That benefits from our consignment programs we have with our distributors. It actually was down sequentially, and it was down from a year ago. So we think that those are in good shape. Do you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A. You guys have been pretty consistent in the past, and you've pointed to valuation and the lack of opportunities as reasons to stay sidelined, but was hoping you could potentially give us an update there, if any changes. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, I'd be happy to comment. The update is no change. It's the same strategy for M&A. We looked at – we're always considering options and looking at things, but it has to be an opportunity that is focused on industrial, it's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog. So it has to be a good strategic fit from that standpoint. But then the other component that has to be there is that the numbers have to make sense. So when we have both of those combinations, then we are willing to move forward on considering that further. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Thank you, Toshiya. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator Thank you. We'll move now to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions from me as well. I guess one, fairly impressive growth in the Analog side. I think it was up like 20% year over year. Is there a way to think about the growth in the segment excluding the consumer side, where I think you may have had somewhat easier comps? Just trying to get a sense of what the baseline number could be on Analog as you go through the year. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. I think first of all, let me just make a comment at the company level. We talked about that the demand was driven from the strength that we saw in the industrial market as well as automotive. That represented about 70% of the growth, and certainly we did benefit and see growth inside of personal electronics off of the easy compare, as we all remember a year ago that we were working through an inventory correction in that particular end market. So the great news is that's very consistent with what we saw inside of Analog, and so the growth is very, very broad based. So we've got contributions from the industrial market, contributions from the automotive market, and as well as we did see contributions from the personal electronics market. So do you have a follow-on? Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC I do. I guess just in the automotive segment, could you just talk about if there's a way to think about maybe what percent of your auto revenues today are infotainment-centric versus more mandate driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety? And is there a way to think about the geographic split in the auto business as well? Thank you. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yeah, thanks. That's a great question, Amit, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on it. You know, I think that the great thing that we've been trying to do, or the thing that we've been trying to do and why we're happy with the results, is that our automotive business isn't just built on just either infotainment or an ADAS business. It really is broad based. So when we look at kind of the order of the sizes of those business, the infotainment is the largest. Safety systems is the second, followed by advanced driver assist systems, then power train, which includes hybrid and electric and then body, electronics and lighting. So, and if you dive into any one of those areas, it's not dominated by one technology or one product. And we've got more than half of our 60 to 70 product lines that ship products into the automotive business. So we're very diverse from a product standpoint. We're also very diverse from a geography standpoint as well, so we're really seeing a benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos. So thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator At this time, we'll move to C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Apologies for, I guess first question, I got on a little bit late, so just have a point of clarification. In terms of the royalty commentary, the $30 million, was that included for Q1 as well? So net-net with that, top line would have been $30 million in gross margin, 100% of that $30 million better? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC And then from here, we should be using that same amount? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated So the change in royalties was included in our guidance, meaning that the royalties were in other income and expense, just like how they came in in results. And on a go-forward basis, they will stay in other income and expense. So for modeling purposes, you can look at how that other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to that on a go-forward basis. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Okay. Thank you. And I guess as a follow up, can you walk through some of the work that you're doing on the gross margin side? It sounds like internally, the 75% is not enough and you want to take that higher. And would love to hear what you're working on, and I'm assuming that includes not only front end but back end manufacturing and would love to get an update there, if you could. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, sure. As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth. And that's what we're focused on industrial and automotive. Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces. Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage, and that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin but more importantly, higher free cash flow, And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator And the next question will be Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm going to use up my first question on just a couple of revenue clarifications. So in response to an earlier question on the, I guess the stronger than expected revenue, so are you telling us that your automotive business was responsible for the upside in Q1 on revenue and comm was a little weak? And then on the Q2 guide, you're basically guiding up like 4.5%. That's below seasonality and also below what you guided sequentially for last year. So you're not seeing any weakness or no change in the Q2 forecasts over the last like month? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. So the first is that our revenue came inside of our guidance, and so we didn't really have any surprises there. If you look at all of the businesses and if you look at the end markets, we really saw strength across the board, Chris. So there really wasn't an area that we would point to that singularly drove the revenues in the quarter or from the midpoint of the guidance, if you will. So very broad based overall. And then secondly, again, I think going back to John's question, when we look at our sequential growth rates of kind of the low end of flat to up 9% or on a year on year basis of 4% to 13%, we think that that's a pretty strong second quarter. So do you have a follow-on? Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yes. Just a longer-term question. I think you've talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around $18 billion in revenue capacity. What sort of revenue level would you start to need to order more equipment? I assume you wouldn't wait until you're 100% utilized before you start to put those orders in. Is it 90% utilization, 95%? Maybe give us some color there. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Well, I'll give you some color and then I'll let Dave chime in. But, we think of our strategy, as stated in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, and I'll just add, Chris, like you pointed out, we had a little over $13 billion in revenue last year. We've got just under about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. We have open 200-millimeter capacity inside of that footprint. So we've got plenty of room to grow for some time. But like Rafael said, if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it was at the right price, we'd make that move, because it is an asymmetrical bet. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator We'll now move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and maybe I'll ask the same related question here. When you look at the guidance, well actually if you just look at the overall business, you're not the only ones seeing double digit year over year growth in all of your businesses. Even if you've taken out personal electronics, the rest of the business is up strong. And the commentary actually suggests that it remains strong. So I guess kind of two parts here. One, how do you foot the gap between what, I know there is content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then I guess as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, so I think if you walk through the end markets, Blayne, as we've commented, automotive has remained strong. You saw that that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just one OEM or one car model or one end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double ordering or seeing inventories build. I'd just make the comment that overall the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So, we have no indications that inventories are growing or double ordering, but I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility into distribution inventory, and as I commented earlier, that remains steady, about four weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's in real good shape. Our visibility into customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, actually our inventory, and they pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course is very low. So, as we have been doing for a long time with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focused on keeping lead times steady, and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence, that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great and I apologize. I missed the very beginning, so if you already said this, I apologize. But in terms of your guidance, I kind of get gross margins flattish, maybe down a little bit. I just wanted to make sure that that's the right range. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated The way I would comment on that is, we have said before that our revenues fall through between 70% and 75%. So if you do that math on a sequential basis, you'll get somewhere close to where you need to be. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator I'm sorry. We'll take a question now from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. You talked about how your investment priorities were in industrial and automotive. Can you give us some idea within automotive, are there specific types of products or specific capabilities that you're directing your investments at? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, David. As I mentioned before, we're very intentionally trying to make investments across a very broad number of areas. So they include things that are very popular like ADAS systems and infotainment systems, but also embody electronics and lighting. So we've commented before that that includes areas like turn signals. There's a couple of dollars of content in an LED turn signal and our sales teams get pretty excited about things like that. But also sensors on door handles and inside of the infotainment system, the touch buttons to control the AC or the audio system, haptic systems that may sit inside of the steering wheel or in driver's seats, and LED lighting inside of a car. There's a lot of areas. So we're really trying to direct that investment to be very, very broad based. Do you have a follow-on, David? David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Yes. Well, similarly for industrial, you mentioned the 14 areas you were going to bore us with. Are there any additional areas on top of the 14 that you will be able to go into because of your investments? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, so I'll resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those. But if I just take one like Medical, as an example, that sits inside of there, there's literally hundreds of end equipment that will sit inside of medical. And if you think of at the high end, there may be a magnetic resonance imaging machine that may sell for millions of dollars, and then all the way down at the other end, you have a blood glucose meter that may sell for less than $50. So we actually have over 100 different end equipments that will sit inside of a sector like medical, and as we make investments, we look to funnel those investments, not just in one area like something like factory automation and control, as an example. We really want to funnel those investments on a very broad basis. So thank you, David, and we can go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you. My first question on lead times. So you mentioned your lead times are very stable. You're maybe seeing some stretch in certain specific areas. But if you look at the general environment, does it feel like the supply chain is overly nervous about getting product, or does it feel like it's pretty controlled? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, Tore. Again, I can really only speak for what we see and what we're doing. And again, I think we're advantaged because we've got a large portion of our revenues on consignment, so we're actually controlling that inventory up and to the point that it gets pulled. We also, for many customers, we'll get long-term forecasts. Those consignment forecasts literally sometimes can be on an hourly basis, but certainly on a daily or weekly basis and typically go out for six months in some cases. Now that doesn't mean that they can't change very quickly, and we've seen that before in the past and they can strengthen or weaken and that usually happens very quickly. So again, our lead times are remaining very stable besides those isolated areas that we're working very aggressively to fix. The vast majority of our products remain stable. Do you have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. That's very helpful. As a follow up, I think you mentioned industrial strengthening. So I assume that means it's going to be up more in June than it was in March. And again, is that strength broad based, or is there any region that's waking up a little bit more than others? And I'm especially thinking about China, because there's been some recent weakness there. I'm just wondering if that region is holding up as well in industrial. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yeah, Tore, the comment was around the quarter that we reported, and we've seen industrial strengthen now for a number of quarters in a row. Our guidance for the second quarter, we just provide the top level and EPS. If there is anything that's unusual going on in an end market, we always provide that color to be helpful. And we haven't had to provide that obviously for second quarter. So thank you, and I think we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator The question will be from with Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on R&D and as it relates to OpEx. Rafael, you kind of articulated that the OpEx will be in the band that you have provided in the past, so no change there. But R&D on a year over year basis in absolute dollars has been growing, and in your last filing, you mentioned that you would be reallocating from manufacturing as well as SG&A into R&D. So just kind of like a two-part question is, one, what should be the trajectory of R&D as we model through the year? And then kind of related to that, qualitatively if you could help us understand where the focus is for the R&D investment. Thank you. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. Let me address the second part of that question first. That's clear, we've been focusing on industrial and on automotive. That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets. Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive, so those investments are paying off. On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comments. We like, our stated goal or model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti.com, and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx 20% to 30% in stable times, in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx. Dave, you want to add? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, I'll just add, Ambrish. As you know, when we look at making investments, whether it's in R&D or in OpEx, as we pointed out in our capital management presentation that we gave earlier, investing in the businesses is a top priority. So, and what we're try to do, as Rafael indicated by market, but we also want to strengthen our four competitive advantages. So those include the first one which is manufacturing and technology, ensuring that we're developing great process technologies and strengthening our position with 300-millimeter. The breadth of the portfolio is the second, and we've talked about that a lot and how that plays out through industrial and automotive. The third is the reach of our marketing channels and strengthening that, and that continues to be our investments in ti.com as well as how that's coupled with our sales force and apps teams. And then we want all those things to lead to the diversity and longevity, and that will lead to good free cash flow per share growth, and that's really what we want to do. Did you have a follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) No, that was it. Thank you very much. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. Well thank you all for joining us tonight and a replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator And again, that does conclude today's call.

At this time, we'll take our first question in the queue. This will be from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, and solid job on the quarterly execution. From a product and end market perspective, it appears that demand is relatively broad based. I'm wondering if you can comment on demand by geographies. I'm assuming that that's also fairly broad based as well, but wanted to see if there were any regions which are exhibiting any weakness. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, Harlan. Yes, I would say that the demand was very broad based and included regionals. Year over year, revenue was up in Asia, Europe and the U.S. And revenue was about even in Japan from a year ago. You have a follow up? Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yes, I do. Thanks for that. Auto, a solid market for the team last year with that end market up 23%. I think you mentioned that it's up double digits again in March. You've got a very diversified business here as well. There's been some concern around the global auto markets and the potential for a slowdown, given indications that production and/or demand after two solid years might start to slow. Just wanted to get the team's sense on the health of this market kind of near to midterm. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. I definitely, as we stated in the opening remarks, that we saw our demand for our products in automotive continued to be strong. And so like you said, we've built that business across a very diverse set of sectors. And in fact, we've got five sectors inside of automotive. So it's diverse not only in the products that we sell into, but it's diverse across customers, across geos. So we feel very good about our position in automotive. And then over the medium and longer term, we think that our pipeline of designs continues to be very strong. And if you look at the average content in a car today, I think most people would put it somewhere between $350 and $400. That's roughly about 1%, or a little more than 1% of the sales price of a car. And I think a lot of analysts inside of a 10-year timeframe have that moving somewhere closer to 2%. So that's we continue to invest in it, and we're really pleased with the position that we've developed so far. Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thank you. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Thanks, Harlan. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask about OpEx. Did that come in in line with your original plan for the quarter or was it different? And how should we think about the OpEx trajectory into Q2? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. Thanks for the call. I'll handle that one. On OpEx, everything came in about as expected. What I would tell you, the way you want to think about OpEx, high level, we've talked about our model where we want to run OpEx between 20% and 30% of revenue and in stable markets at the lower end of that, the lower half. And that's exactly what we've been doing for the last couple of years. And in fact, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're just below that. So as you think forward, you should model us along those lines. If you're thinking kind of on a tactical level first to second, I would remind you that second quarter does have three months of higher pay and benefit raises versus only two months in first quarter. So you may have some of that played in kind of similar to what happened last year, maybe a little less than that. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Do you have a follow-on, Stacy? Stacy Aaron Rasgon - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, yes I do. On your capital management update from a month or two ago, you had given some indicators of where 300-millimeter loading was, but it only went up a little bit in 2016. I think it went from about $2.2 billion year over year to $2.5 billion, so maybe $300 million, suggesting a good amount of headroom left for that transition to continue. How should we expect that trajectory to evolve this year in 2017? Is it just dependent on growth? Is there volume in 200-millimeter that's ramping down as 300-millimeter is ramping up? Like how should we think about where that might end up exiting this year in a normal demand environment? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yeah, Stacy, in the capital management update, if you remember, we talked about the fact that we've put in place about $8 billion of 300-millimeter capacity. Last year we had, as you stated, about $2.5 billion, so we're in a great position to be able to support growth. And essentially, we've been releasing for sometime now really probably going back to 2010, almost all of our new Analog products to 300-millimeter. So there's some exceptions to that, of course, on some older technologies that don't make sense to do, but the vast majority of them have been released there. So as you think about the Analog business growing, you can think of that incremental growth essentially being built on 300-millimeter. And if you look at last year, that came pretty close to what happened. So we had about $300 million of growth, so it's very consistent with that. So, thank you, Stacy, and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Dave, you were kind enough in your prepared comments to go through end markets in the March quarter on a year over year basis. I think the comm equipment was the only market you gave sequential color. I'm just curious if you can talk a little bit about the sequential growth into March. It was well above seasonal and sort of in the same vein, to your guidance in June, you're guiding below seasonal. So how should we think about that from an end market perspective? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. So a couple of things. We thought the comms equipment market has been choppy in recent past, so we thought that that would be helpful, and that's why we provided it. If I'd just comment on the other markets sequentially, automotive market, as we said, continued to be strong. It increased with most of the sectors growing. Industrial demand was strong across almost every sector that we ship into. And just as a reminder, we've got 14 different sectors there. I won't put everybody to sleep by going through them, but we do have quite a number of sectors that are inside of that and literally hundreds of end equipment that fit inside of that. So it's very, very broad based. Personal electronics decreased. You usually see that seasonally. And then enterprise systems was about even. So, when we look at our guidance for second quarter, if we're looking at that sequentially, the low end of our guidance would suggest that revenues would be flat. The high end of the guidance suggests that it would be up 9%. And if you look at that, John, on a year on year basis, the low end would be up 4% and the high end would be up 13%. So we think that that's fairly robust growth inside of the second quarter. So you have a follow-on, John? John William Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Yes, that's helpful. And I guess as my follow-on, I might have missed this and I apologize, but did you give an orders number for the quarter? And just in general, how are lead times either of your products or your competitors' products, because there has been some buzz that perhaps lead times within the industry are starting to stretch out? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. So orders were up 14% year on year to $3.5 billion. They were up about 2% sequentially. And I think from a lead time standpoint, our lead times have remained stable. And just as important as that, our on-time delivery metrics also remain very high. So our shipping to our commitments that we make to customers remain very high. So with that said, we do have some isolated process and package combinations where lead times have stretched, but we've worked very aggressively on those. So we're very pleased with where we are to be able to keep ahead of demand. Well thank you, John. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on inventory, Dave. I guess exiting the quarter, inventory days were at 132 days, toward the high end of your guided range. How comfortable are you with that level? And what are you seeing in terms of the distribution channel? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, we are – well, I'll answer our inventory days and then I'll let Dave comment on the disti channel. But we're comfortable with our inventory days. It's well within our range. Always remember inventory days is a backwards looking metric, so what we have it there for is to support growth. And the other key point to remember is as we have focused our strategy more on industrial, automotive and on catalog type of parts, the risk of obsolescence on this part is really minimal. So it makes sense from a longer-term standpoint to have that inventory available to support revenue growth. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, and from a disti standpoint, Toshiya, we saw our inventory days kind of remain near their current levels, at four weeks. That benefits from our consignment programs we have with our distributors. It actually was down sequentially, and it was down from a year ago. So we think that those are in good shape. Do you have a follow-on? Toshiya Hari - Goldman Sachs & Co. Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on M&A. You guys have been pretty consistent in the past, and you've pointed to valuation and the lack of opportunities as reasons to stay sidelined, but was hoping you could potentially give us an update there, if any changes. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, I'd be happy to comment. The update is no change. It's the same strategy for M&A. We looked at – we're always considering options and looking at things, but it has to be an opportunity that is focused on industrial, it's focused on automotive, catalog type of parts, Analog catalog. So it has to be a good strategic fit from that standpoint. But then the other component that has to be there is that the numbers have to make sense. So when we have both of those combinations, then we are willing to move forward on considering that further. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Thank you, Toshiya. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator Thank you. We'll move now to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions from me as well. I guess one, fairly impressive growth in the Analog side. I think it was up like 20% year over year. Is there a way to think about the growth in the segment excluding the consumer side, where I think you may have had somewhat easier comps? Just trying to get a sense of what the baseline number could be on Analog as you go through the year. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. I think first of all, let me just make a comment at the company level. We talked about that the demand was driven from the strength that we saw in the industrial market as well as automotive. That represented about 70% of the growth, and certainly we did benefit and see growth inside of personal electronics off of the easy compare, as we all remember a year ago that we were working through an inventory correction in that particular end market. So the great news is that's very consistent with what we saw inside of Analog, and so the growth is very, very broad based. So we've got contributions from the industrial market, contributions from the automotive market, and as well as we did see contributions from the personal electronics market. So do you have a follow-on? Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC I do. I guess just in the automotive segment, could you just talk about if there's a way to think about maybe what percent of your auto revenues today are infotainment-centric versus more mandate driven around fuel efficiency or battery management or safety? And is there a way to think about the geographic split in the auto business as well? Thank you. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yeah, thanks. That's a great question, Amit, and thanks for the opportunity to comment on it. You know, I think that the great thing that we've been trying to do, or the thing that we've been trying to do and why we're happy with the results, is that our automotive business isn't just built on just either infotainment or an ADAS business. It really is broad based. So when we look at kind of the order of the sizes of those business, the infotainment is the largest. Safety systems is the second, followed by advanced driver assist systems, then power train, which includes hybrid and electric and then body, electronics and lighting. So, and if you dive into any one of those areas, it's not dominated by one technology or one product. And we've got more than half of our 60 to 70 product lines that ship products into the automotive business. So we're very diverse from a product standpoint. We're also very diverse from a geography standpoint as well, so we're really seeing a benefit and additional revenue growth from all of the geos. So thank you, Amit. And we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator At this time, we'll move to C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Apologies for, I guess first question, I got on a little bit late, so just have a point of clarification. In terms of the royalty commentary, the $30 million, was that included for Q1 as well? So net-net with that, top line would have been $30 million in gross margin, 100% of that $30 million better? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC And then from here, we should be using that same amount? Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated So the change in royalties was included in our guidance, meaning that the royalties were in other income and expense, just like how they came in in results. And on a go-forward basis, they will stay in other income and expense. So for modeling purposes, you can look at how that other income and expense line came in and then model it similar to that on a go-forward basis. C.J. Muse - Evercore Group LLC Okay. Thank you. And I guess as a follow up, can you walk through some of the work that you're doing on the gross margin side? It sounds like internally, the 75% is not enough and you want to take that higher. And would love to hear what you're working on, and I'm assuming that includes not only front end but back end manufacturing and would love to get an update there, if you could. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, sure. As you think of the company on a go forward basis, the biggest driver of our gross margin is revenue, revenue growth. And that's what we're focused on industrial and automotive. Those are the best opportunities that we have ahead of us because of the constant growth of semiconductors in those spaces. Now, beyond revenue growth, then we have 300-millimeter manufacturing, the efficiency of our manufacturing, particularly with 300 millimeter. As you probably recall from the capital management strategy, I walked through why 300-millimeter is such a competitive advantage, and that's because the cost of the chip is significantly less. In fact, it's 40% less at the chip level than on 200-millimeter. So what that translates to is not just higher gross margin but more importantly, higher free cash flow, And then free cash flow per share that we can return to the owners of the company. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. Thank you, C.J., and we'll go to the next caller, please. Operator And the next question will be Chris Danely with Citi. Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. I'm going to use up my first question on just a couple of revenue clarifications. So in response to an earlier question on the, I guess the stronger than expected revenue, so are you telling us that your automotive business was responsible for the upside in Q1 on revenue and comm was a little weak? And then on the Q2 guide, you're basically guiding up like 4.5%. That's below seasonality and also below what you guided sequentially for last year. So you're not seeing any weakness or no change in the Q2 forecasts over the last like month? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. So the first is that our revenue came inside of our guidance, and so we didn't really have any surprises there. If you look at all of the businesses and if you look at the end markets, we really saw strength across the board, Chris. So there really wasn't an area that we would point to that singularly drove the revenues in the quarter or from the midpoint of the guidance, if you will. So very broad based overall. And then secondly, again, I think going back to John's question, when we look at our sequential growth rates of kind of the low end of flat to up 9% or on a year on year basis of 4% to 13%, we think that that's a pretty strong second quarter. So do you have a follow-on? Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yes. Just a longer-term question. I think you've talked about currently being outfitted for somewhere around $18 billion in revenue capacity. What sort of revenue level would you start to need to order more equipment? I assume you wouldn't wait until you're 100% utilized before you start to put those orders in. Is it 90% utilization, 95%? Maybe give us some color there. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Well, I'll give you some color and then I'll let Dave chime in. But, we think of our strategy, as stated in the capital management strategy for many years, is that we want to add capacity well ahead of demand. And that's because this is an asymmetrical bet. This capacity we can buy. When we buy that way, we can buy used equipment and we can buy it at pennies on the dollar where the carrying cost is minimal but the upside potential is tremendous for the reasons that I talked about earlier and the great fall through that we get to free cash flow. So we're thinking longer term, 10, 15 years out when we're making capacity decisions. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, and I'll just add, Chris, like you pointed out, we had a little over $13 billion in revenue last year. We've got just under about $6 billion of open 300-millimeter capacity. We have open 200-millimeter capacity inside of that footprint. So we've got plenty of room to grow for some time. But like Rafael said, if we had the opportunity tomorrow to buy another wafer fab or make a large purchase and it was at the right price, we'd make that move, because it is an asymmetrical bet. So thank you, Chris, and we'll go to the next caller please. Operator We'll now move to Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and maybe I'll ask the same related question here. When you look at the guidance, well actually if you just look at the overall business, you're not the only ones seeing double digit year over year growth in all of your businesses. Even if you've taken out personal electronics, the rest of the business is up strong. And the commentary actually suggests that it remains strong. So I guess kind of two parts here. One, how do you foot the gap between what, I know there is content gains in semis, but between what some of the end markets are doing, what's your perspective as you look out the rest of the year? Do you think the semi market is a little ahead of itself? And then I guess as you look at your June guidance, did you guys apply any sort of conservatism to that guidance to account for anything along those lines? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, so I think if you walk through the end markets, Blayne, as we've commented, automotive has remained strong. You saw that that business last quarter had grown at over 20%. It's been growing very strongly for some time. And again, that business and that growth isn't built on just one OEM or one car model or one end market. So it's very, very diverse, and we feel good about that positioning. When you look at the industrial market, that strength has continued to build. So we're seeing that come in nicely. We already talked about the personal electronics markets and some of the other markets in detail. So again, that strength, and as you pointed out, is broad based. Others are seeing it as well. So kind of on the other thing is, to your question, are we double ordering or seeing inventories build. I'd just make the comment that overall the economy does feel a little stronger than it did a year ago. However, it's really still to be seen to what extent will we see this growth over a longer period of time. So, we have no indications that inventories are growing or double ordering, but I'll also point out that history suggests that you never really see that ahead of time, right? So I think it's important to qualify what we can see. I mentioned earlier our lead times have remained stable. When you look into inventory, we've got good visibility into distribution inventory, and as I commented earlier, that remains steady, about four weeks. It's down sequentially. It's down from a year ago. So we think that's in real good shape. Our visibility into customer inventories really varies depending on if they're on consignment or not. So on consigned OEMs, we've got great visibility into their inventory because we're holding it on our books, actually our inventory, and they pull it only when they need it. And we're not seeing any unusual signs there, so things like expedites and things like that that would suggest that there's an issue overall. And our visibility into inventory, of course beyond our customers' manufacturing operations and down in their channels, of course is very low. So, as we have been doing for a long time with our manufacturing, our internal inventory strategies, we'll just stay focused on keeping lead times steady, and delivery metrics very high, because that's ultimately what gives customers confidence, that they can get support from us when they need it. Do you have a follow-on? Blayne Curtis - Barclays Capital, Inc. Great and I apologize. I missed the very beginning, so if you already said this, I apologize. But in terms of your guidance, I kind of get gross margins flattish, maybe down a little bit. I just wanted to make sure that that's the right range. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated The way I would comment on that is, we have said before that our revenues fall through between 70% and 75%. So if you do that math on a sequential basis, you'll get somewhere close to where you need to be. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. Thank you. And we'll go to the next caller please. Operator I'm sorry. We'll take a question now from David Wong with Wells Fargo. David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thanks very much. You talked about how your investment priorities were in industrial and automotive. Can you give us some idea within automotive, are there specific types of products or specific capabilities that you're directing your investments at? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, David. As I mentioned before, we're very intentionally trying to make investments across a very broad number of areas. So they include things that are very popular like ADAS systems and infotainment systems, but also embody electronics and lighting. So we've commented before that that includes areas like turn signals. There's a couple of dollars of content in an LED turn signal and our sales teams get pretty excited about things like that. But also sensors on door handles and inside of the infotainment system, the touch buttons to control the AC or the audio system, haptic systems that may sit inside of the steering wheel or in driver's seats, and LED lighting inside of a car. There's a lot of areas. So we're really trying to direct that investment to be very, very broad based. Do you have a follow-on, David? David M. Wong - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Yes. Well, similarly for industrial, you mentioned the 14 areas you were going to bore us with. Are there any additional areas on top of the 14 that you will be able to go into because of your investments? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, so I'll resist the temptation to bore you and run you through those. But if I just take one like Medical, as an example, that sits inside of there, there's literally hundreds of end equipment that will sit inside of medical. And if you think of at the high end, there may be a magnetic resonance imaging machine that may sell for millions of dollars, and then all the way down at the other end, you have a blood glucose meter that may sell for less than $50. So we actually have over 100 different end equipments that will sit inside of a sector like medical, and as we make investments, we look to funnel those investments, not just in one area like something like factory automation and control, as an example. We really want to funnel those investments on a very broad basis. So thank you, David, and we can go to the next caller, please. Operator We'll now move to Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you. My first question on lead times. So you mentioned your lead times are very stable. You're maybe seeing some stretch in certain specific areas. But if you look at the general environment, does it feel like the supply chain is overly nervous about getting product, or does it feel like it's pretty controlled? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, Tore. Again, I can really only speak for what we see and what we're doing. And again, I think we're advantaged because we've got a large portion of our revenues on consignment, so we're actually controlling that inventory up and to the point that it gets pulled. We also, for many customers, we'll get long-term forecasts. Those consignment forecasts literally sometimes can be on an hourly basis, but certainly on a daily or weekly basis and typically go out for six months in some cases. Now that doesn't mean that they can't change very quickly, and we've seen that before in the past and they can strengthen or weaken and that usually happens very quickly. So again, our lead times are remaining very stable besides those isolated areas that we're working very aggressively to fix. The vast majority of our products remain stable. Do you have a follow-on, Tore? Tore Svanberg - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. That's very helpful. As a follow up, I think you mentioned industrial strengthening. So I assume that means it's going to be up more in June than it was in March. And again, is that strength broad based, or is there any region that's waking up a little bit more than others? And I'm especially thinking about China, because there's been some recent weakness there. I'm just wondering if that region is holding up as well in industrial. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yeah, Tore, the comment was around the quarter that we reported, and we've seen industrial strengthen now for a number of quarters in a row. Our guidance for the second quarter, we just provide the top level and EPS. If there is anything that's unusual going on in an end market, we always provide that color to be helpful. And we haven't had to provide that obviously for second quarter. So thank you, and I think we've got time for one more caller, please. Operator The question will be from with Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I had a question on R&D and as it relates to OpEx. Rafael, you kind of articulated that the OpEx will be in the band that you have provided in the past, so no change there. But R&D on a year over year basis in absolute dollars has been growing, and in your last filing, you mentioned that you would be reallocating from manufacturing as well as SG&A into R&D. So just kind of like a two-part question is, one, what should be the trajectory of R&D as we model through the year? And then kind of related to that, qualitatively if you could help us understand where the focus is for the R&D investment. Thank you. Rafael R. Lizardi - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes. Let me address the second part of that question first. That's clear, we've been focusing on industrial and on automotive. That's where we have been biasing our investments for a number of years, and that's why we're getting strong results in both of those end markets. Now over half of our revenue is coming from industrial and automotive, so those investments are paying off. On your first part of your question, I would take you back to my earlier comments. We like, our stated goal or model is 20% to 30% OpEx. I know you're asking about R&D, but we like to look at it as OpEx because there are a lot of pieces there that we think of as investments, investments in sales, in the sales force, in ti.com, and a few other things that help us build those competitive advantages. So OpEx 20% to 30% in stable times, in the bottom half of that, so 20% to 25%, and we have been running like that for now 27 months. So you should think about that way when you're modeling our OpEx. Dave, you want to add? David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Yes, I'll just add, Ambrish. As you know, when we look at making investments, whether it's in R&D or in OpEx, as we pointed out in our capital management presentation that we gave earlier, investing in the businesses is a top priority. So, and what we're try to do, as Rafael indicated by market, but we also want to strengthen our four competitive advantages. So those include the first one which is manufacturing and technology, ensuring that we're developing great process technologies and strengthening our position with 300-millimeter. The breadth of the portfolio is the second, and we've talked about that a lot and how that plays out through industrial and automotive. The third is the reach of our marketing channels and strengthening that, and that continues to be our investments in ti.com as well as how that's coupled with our sales force and apps teams. And then we want all those things to lead to the diversity and longevity, and that will lead to good free cash flow per share growth, and that's really what we want to do. Did you have a follow-up? Ambrish Srivastava - BMO Capital Markets (United States) No, that was it. Thank you very much. David Pahl - Texas Instruments Incorporated Okay. Well thank you all for joining us tonight and a replay of this call is available on our website. Good evening. Operator And again, that does conclude today's call.

Joining us here in Chicago to discuss our results are Chief Executive Officer, Oscar Munoz; President, Scott Kirby; and Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Levy. We also have others in the room available to assist with Q&A. And now I would like to turn the call over to Oscar. Oscar Munoz Thank you, Julie. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we review United's performance for the previous quarter, I want to address the events on last week. The incident on Flight 3411 has been a humbling, learning experience for all of us here at United and for me, in particular. In addition to apologizing to Dr. Dao as well as all the passengers aboard, I also want to apologize to our customers. You can and should expect more from us and as CEO, I take full responsibility for making this right. We've always sought to repay our customers' trust with the highest quality of service and deepest level of respect and dignity. We are and will make the necessary policy changes to ensure this never happens again. Those changes began with two key announcements last week. First, from now on, we'll not call for law enforcement to remove passengers from our flight, except in cases of security or safety concerns. Second, crews traveling on our aircraft must be booked at least 60 minutes prior to departure. In addition, we continue to review a broader array of policies and systems that factor into situations like this. And importantly, we are involving our front-line employees and, to a degree, some of our customers to help us take a more common-sense approach to how we do things. We'll communicate the results of our review and the additional actions we will take by April 30th. Now if I could, turning to the topic of earnings and operational performance. As the positive financial results we will discuss today make clear, our people have done a great work to create a more reliable, profitable, and financially sound airline for our customers, investors and everyone we serve. Our financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2017 gives us a lot of confidence about the foundation we're building, but it's clear we have further to go in terms of elevating the experience our customers have with us. This is a true learning opportunity and will ultimately prove to be a watershed moment for our company as we work harder than ever to put our customers at the center of everything we do. Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to give an update on operations and revenue. Scott Kirby Thank you, Oscar, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. I echo Oscar's thoughts on last week's incident. Our entire leadership team and the entire airline is focused on learning from this terrible event and making United truly customer-focused in everything that we do. While we had a big failure last week, our 2017 operational and financial performance is off to a strong start. Building on a record 2016, we're already setting new operational records in 2017 and our performance improved as the quarter progressed. Demand is solid and we performed in line with our unit revenue forecast during the quarter despite better completion factor, which led to higher capacity. The positive momentum and the revenue environment that we saw late last year continued into the first quarter and our outlook for the second quarter unit revenue growth is stronger today on higher capacity growth than it was just a few months ago. We expect to return to positive system unit revenue growth in the second quarter, which will mark positive year-over-year growth in this key metric for the first time since early 2015, assuming the quarter plays out as we expect. On slide five, we show operational improvements in the quarter. We remain focused on continually improving our operational reliability. Our completion factor performance in the quarter improved from last year, helped by 25 days of 100% mainline completion, which surpassed our annual record set just last year and is more perfect days than all of 2011 through 2015 combined. Our mishandled baggage performance continues to improve. We achieved our best-ever consolidated on-time departure rate for February and any March, and year-to-date; each of our major competitors had canceled more than twice as many flights as has United. Slide six illustrates how changes to our yield management posture are also allowing us to drive better revenue results. As you can see for the past two years, United had a philosophy of never letting advance booked load factor get behind. For the past two years, our bookings 60 days in advance were never [indiscernible] 2% behind. And if your goal is to keep bookings high, the easiest way to do that is to lower the prices, and that's exactly what United was doing. In fact, if you look at slide seven in our deck, we're just industry PRASM in general due to the step function change in the fourth quarter, and I think this was primarily driven by United reducing its reliance on advance-purchase discounts. The second problem with this strategy was that we sold out too soon and spilled our natural market share of close-in business demand to our competitors. As you can see back on slide six, we changed that posture and are now willing to take much more risk that high-yield business customers are going to choose United if we just keep seats available for them. And it's working. In the first quarter, our close-in bookings were up around 12% year-over-year and our corporate revenue was up 11% year-over-year compared with an average of down 1% for the last three quarters. The Easter shift and the extra Friday in March did help, but we also think this is evident that United is restoring its natural market share. Despite starting well behind, you could see that we closed the load factor gap in both the fourth and first quarters and we expect and hope to do so again in the second quarter. This change leads to a better overall pricing environment and better mix and allows United to simply restore our natural close-in to business demand market share. While all of our competitors are lowering their unit revenue outlook from the first quarter, our forecast started just below our guided midpoint and improved to flat despite a one point higher completion factor. This phenomenon at our competitors wasn't about demand weakness. It was about United customers coming back to United, and we simply couldn't accommodate them in years past because we weren't leaving seats for the last minute bookings customers. In the past, we forced many of our best customers to fly with our competitors because we were sold out and our changes now mean that they can and are returning to United Airlines. While the whole industry is seeing strong close-in demand, United is better positioned to capitalize on it with more seats to sell close-in on a year-over-year basis. We expect the second quarter to be United's best PRASM performance in two years. Our consolidated PRASM was flat for the first quarter, right at the midpoint of our guidance provided in January despite running one point higher in completion factor. We saw strong close-in demand in March, and throughout the quarter, we saw improvement across the system, with Houston, Washington Dulles and Chicago all showing positive year-over-year improvement. Internationally, both the Atlantic and Pacific performance was better than forecasted. The strength in the Atlantic was boosted by strong results in Germany and a U.S. point-of-sale shift, while the Pacific was helped by positive PRASM in Japan. We anticipate second quarter consolidated PRASM to be up 1% to 2% -- 1% to 3%, 200 basis points better than at the midpoint from the first quarter. If the quarter plays out like we think, this will mark the fifth straight quarter of sequential improvement and the first quarter of positive unit revenue growth in two years. Moving to slide eight for an overview by region. During the second quarter, we expect sequential improvement in all geographies, except the Atlantic, which we expect will be approximately flat after surprising with positive growth in the first quarter. The Easter shift had a much more pronounced positive impact on yield in the Atlantic during March than we anticipated and we're now expecting an opposite impact in April. We're currently forecasting solid positive unit revenue growth in domestic and Latin markets. Latin remains a bright spot, and we look for the year-over-year increase to be in the mid-single-digits in the second quarter, driven by strength in Brazil and Argentina and a tailwind from the Easter shift. In the Pacific, declines are expected to moderate again in the second quarter. Our capacity outlook for the second quarter is up 3% to 4%. We expect that growth to be biased towards higher domestic growth with an increase of 4.5% to 5.5%. Our domestic year-over-year growth will peak in June and July, driven by improved utilization of our fleet this summer. Our full year outlook for system capacity growth remains up 2.5% to 3.5% and is consistent with our updated guidance from March 15. Our capacity growth is comprised of nearly a 5% increase in gauge, partially offset by fewer departures. We're delivering on our promises from Investor Day, which included restoring the domestic network to its natural share in our hubs. Everyone knows that United never should have been flying regional jets in markets like Chicago to Washington National or Newark to Atlanta. We're up-gauging where we should be flying larger planes, and that, by the way, is mostly in places where we historically did fly larger planes. And we're putting smaller planes in markets that will drive better connectivity to our hubs, places like Champaign, Illinois and Rochester, Minnesota. These [indiscernible] markets have better pricing structure than large markets and help to improve connectivity in our hubs. We'll continue to improve connectivity, and we will start re-banking later this fall, which will be the next step in our network optimization. We're even more excited about our opportunities today than we were at Investor Day five months ago, and we look forward to providing proof points that we're executing over the coming quarters and years. To close, I want to, again, say that we're committed to learning from last week's failure by becoming the most customer-centric airline we can be in everything that we do. Now, I'll turn it over to Andrew to review the financial results. Andrew Levy Thanks Scott. Before I turn to the numbers, I want to make it clear I share the sentiments expressed by Oscar and Scott about what occurred last week. Our entire team is working together to identify ways we can become a more customer-focused airline and are confident we will succeed in this goal. Yesterday afternoon, we released our first quarter 2017 earnings as well as our second quarter investor update. I will discuss both our results and outlook at a high level, but please refer to those documents for additional detail. Slide 10 is a summary of our GAAP financials and slide 11 shows our non-GAAP results. In the first quarter, we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. We generated pretax income of $196 million, which represented a 2.3% pretax margin excluding special items. First quarter 2017 results were lower year-over-year mostly due to higher fuel expense and labor rate increases. Turning to slide 12, our first quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party expenses, increased 5% as compared with the first quarter 2016. 4.2 percentage points of this increase was due to new labor rates from the 2016 agreements. For the second quarter, we expect non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items, profit-sharing and third-party expenses, to increase between 4% and 5%, with approximately four percentage points of this increase due to the higher labor rates. Last month, we reduced our guidance for full year 2017 non-fuel unit costs to an increase of between 2.5% and 3.5%. We are affirming this guidance today despite elevated unit cost growth in the first quarter and our forecasted increase in the second quarter of 4.5% at the midpoint of the guided range. We expect the increase in nonfuel unit costs to slow appreciably during the last two quarters of the year. Turning to slide 13, we ended the first quarter with $6.4 billion of unrestricted liquidity, including our recently increased $2 billion revolver, which is comfortably in excess of our stated minimum liquidity target range. As of the end of the first quarter, our gross debt balance, including capitalized operating leases was $17.6 billion. During the quarter, we completed several financing transactions that improved our liquidity by $1.35 billion. This included raising $300 million of unsecured debt at a rate of 5%, increasing our term loan by $440 million to $1.5 billion with more favorable terms and rate, and also upsizing our revolver by $650 million to the $2 billion number I gave you a minute ago. In the quarter, we spent $313 million repurchasing shares at an average price of about $68 a share. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and will continue to be opportunistic to take advantage of pullbacks in the stock. We currently have approximately $1.5 billion remaining of repurchase authority. Our 2017 guidance for CapEx remains between $4.2 billion and $4.4 billion. This is higher than 2016 due primarily to the delivery of 15 wide-body aircraft. Also during the quarter, we purchased 12 737NGs off lease. These are not incremental aircraft to the fleet, but rather aircraft we've operated since new. We expect to enter into many similar transactions when we can cost-effectively purchase leased aircraft that we expect to operate for many years instead of acquiring new aircraft to replace equipment at the end of the lease term. Additionally, we expect to grow the fleet by adding used aircraft. Growing with used aircraft is much less capital-intensive, provides us with greater balance sheet flexibility and therefore, de-risks our business at the margin. Lastly, regarding our fleet, we continue our comprehensive review of the fleet and order book. We continue our work and we will update you when we have new information to share. On slide 14, we show summary of our guidance, including second quarter projected fuel price range, which is using the April 12 curve. The ranges for capacity, revenue and costs imply a second quarter pretax margin between 10% and 12%. In conclusion, we're off to a solid start in 2017 and remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and finding incremental cost-savings opportunities. With that, I'd like to thank you all for joining the call today, and I'll now turn it back to Julie to open it up for Q&A. Julie Yates Stewart Thank you, Andrew. First, we will take questions from the analyst community, then we will take questions from the media. Please limit yourself to one question and if need one follow-up question. Brandon, please describe the procedure to ask a question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And from Cowen, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead. Helane Becker Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. Thank you very much for your time. Just on the bookings over the past -- I mean, this is like very short-term-focused, but are you hearing from any of your corporate accounts about adjusting bookings or whatever for the -- given United's performance over the last couple of weeks with various incidences? Scott Kirby We had a lot of communication with our corporate accounts, and we've had appropriate questions and concerns, particularly with regard to our corporate accounts, with whom we have a good relationship and we've already communicated with. We feel pretty good about the communications that we've had so far and in our ability to reassure them and explain things like overbooking. Some of the steps that we will do with the broader public on our April 30 launch but some of that with our corporate accounts, we've been able to accelerate some of that -- some of their specific concerns. And our sales team has done a wonderful job of being out, talking to them if there has been a concern from corporate accounts, which has been totally appropriate. We feel like we've managed that pretty well. And our corporate accounts are largely supportive. They want us to fix this. They want us to do the right thing. But they believe in us and believe that we will get this fixed. And at the end of the day, we will be stronger, and we will have better customer service when we get through this.  Oscar Munoz And Helane, this is Oscar. I echo the same sentiments. I've had -- go ahead, Helane. Helane Becker No. I was just actually -- I mean, I don't want to beat this up. I just was going to change the subject and actually ask you about regional -- regions in the domestic market. I know you were talking about improvement in various domestic markets, and I wonder if there are any specific areas of improvement that you would call out as being noteworthy. And that was all. Scott Kirby Well, we saw improvement -- we saw PRASM up, actually, the most in Houston. To some degree, that's -- we have less capacity in Houston. We're looking forward to actually re-banking Houston starting later this year, which will allow us the platform to grow Houston and actually improve PRASM even more. The energy sector in Houston, while still down significantly compared to where it was historically, is starting to at least recover from a very low base. Our energy accounts have [rounding up] [ph] 13% during the quarter. We also saw strength in Dulles and Chicago, and the rest of the hubs, while down a little bit, were all down pretty marginally. So really, I would say for the most part, across the board, we're starting to see an improved revenue environment, and we really feel good about the revenue environment, really, across the board. Helane Becker Great. Thank you very much. Operator From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead. Kevin Crissey Good morning. Thanks for the time. Can we talk about the international partners maybe in a big picture, the evolution of the international partnerships, their importance overall, where your strengths and opportunities exist, maybe just a big picture on where international partnerships and alliances and JVs, as you see it, are heading? Thank you. Scott Kirby Well, international JV and partnerships are incredibly important to our customers. They are a way to give a seamless experience to our customers, to get them around the world. This is one of those rare events that if they win, win, win; it's a win for United Airlines. It could be a win for our partners, and it's absolutely a win for our customers. I think we -- and Star Alliance, we all believe that we have an opportunity to do better. We can be more seamlessly integrated with one another and that includes on the commercial front, but to a large degree, that includes the customer experience, where we can make the experience more seamless. And we have a new CEO at Star Alliance, and that is his number one mission. I'll actually be going to the Star Alliance meeting on Mother's Day, which my wife doesn't appreciate, but it's in Germany. And the focus of the meeting is to talk about how we can create a more seamless experience for our customers and really have the focus to be on customers. And we think there's a big opportunity there, and that's something that we'll be working on over the coming years. But our partnerships are really important, and we're looking forward to expanding partnerships, particularly in Latin America with Avianca and Copa, and we think there's a real opportunity. But we have strong partnerships across the Atlantic and Pacific. Adding Avianca, Copa and Azul to those relationships is going to give us the ability to give the American and LatAm a run for their money in Latin America. Kevin Crissey So Scott, would you say that that's the region where you have the biggest opportunity for improvement is in the Latin America region? Scott Kirby Well, we have opportunity for improvement everywhere, but it's the least developed region for us. So yes, it's the area with the most opportunity for improvement. Kevin Crissey Thank you for your time. Operator We have Michael Linenberg on the line. Please standby for just a moment. Michael Linenberg is on the line, please go ahead sir. Michael Linenberg Yes, hey thanks. Two questions here. Hey, Scott, I just want to go back to -- you mentioned Houston, Dulles and Chicago seeing PRASM improvement. Just specifically looking at Newark, if it weren't for the fact that Newark-Florida fares were somewhat depressed, if we were to exclude that, would have Newark's PRASM been up? Scott Kirby Newark what fares? Michael Linenberg If you were to exclude -- to Florida. Scott Kirby Excluding Florida. I mean, Newark was down 1%, and so I don't know. And actually, what's happened in Newark is there was a flood of low-cost carrier capacity, and for a long time, United Airlines did not match the prices. We started matching the prices and I think our revenues, while down in those markets, is down less than it was before. So, we feel really good about that strategy. At least our incremental change in strategy and competing more aggressively with the low-cost carriers in Newark, I think, is revenue positive. To be clear, with all the capacity in Florida, PRASM is certainly down, but it was down even more before we decided to start competing aggressively.  Michael Linenberg Well. And then just my second question, Andrew, you talked about growing the fleet with used aircraft. And I guess up until this point, you've -- predominantly, it's -- well, I shouldn't say predominantly, it's all been narrow-body. And I'm curious about your thoughts about used wide-bodies. I think the view out in the marketplace is that reconfiguration costs are too high. Hence, we don't see airlines really look at used wide-bodies. I mean, what are your thoughts on that? Are there opportunities there for you, if you can elaborate?  Andrew Levy Yes. Hey, Mike. Michael Linenberg Hey. Andrew Levy The wide-body market is severely depressed across the board. There's tremendous opportunities in the used market. There's a lot of really good high-quality aircraft available at very, very attractive low rates. So you're right that the reconfiguration costs are certainly more significant, and it's, perhaps, a little bit tougher to make the economics work in a normal situation. Certainly, with the -- today, I think we're in a different period in the market, and so we are actively looking at wide-bodies and narrow-bodies and we'll see. I think obviously, the weakness in demand for that sector has been well documented. It's nothing new. And I know the OEMs are feeling it as well. So, we'll see if we can take advantage of the dislocations that we believe is there and will continue to be there for quite some time. Michael Linenberg Great. Thanks Andrew. Andrew Levy Thanks. Operator From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay Hey good morning. Scott, at the Analyst Day in November, you said that historically, inflections in RASM usually involve a couple months of nail-biting, where you're behind on advance bookings, which is exactly what's happening, obviously, in slide six. So we're obviously more than a couple months into it at this point. So I guess the question is, are you deep enough into this point where you can say that you're seeing that big turn, which is what you described it as in November, in the revenue environment? Or do you need a couple more months to go before you can safely say that we have had that big turn, which are your words that you said in November? Scott Kirby Well, Hunter, you've followed me long enough to know that I'm an optimist by nature, so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt. But yes, I think we had a great turn in revenue in the fourth quarter. If you can just look at that graph, I think it was slide, what, six or seven for us and you can see going from RASM that is down 7.4%, down 6.6%, down 5.8%, all of a sudden to down 1.6%. That's a big step function change and there really wasn't a big change in industry capacity at that point, not a flat, not up to -- something changed in the fourth quarter. And my hypothesis is that what changed in the fourth quarter was United's revenue management philosophy, which leads to a pricing philosophy change and that has changed and we expect things to continue to grow. What's not even in these numbers which will bear in the second half of the year is Basic Economy, which we think is going to be really big, predictably by the time we get it at steady state. But I think there was inflection point in the fourth quarter and I feel pretty good that that has happened. Hunter Keay Okay. And this is actually sort of a related question. You mentioned Basic Economy. I want to get back to a question asked a few months ago about distribution as well. In an ideal world, if you're able to get the distribution paradigm sort of adjusted to exactly how you want it to be. Is there more of an opportunity to drive incremental revenues at the really, really low end like through things like Basic Economy or at the really, really high end by turning airlines into -- dynamically, you're competing on things like product and schedule, with price way at the bottom of the list. So, the question is, low-end or high-end opportunity as it relates to the distribution changes that you expect over the next couple of years. Scott Kirby Well, I think that there's opportunity on both. At United, and I said this at my previous airline, roughly half of our revenue is coming from infrequent customers and half is coming from premium customers, customers that fly as often. And it's a little over simplistic to say that, that half of revenue coming from infrequent customers just cares about price because a lot them care about more than that. It's also -- the flip side is true that some of our frequent customers are really shopping on price as well. But at a high level, you can think of it simplistically as half and half and we need to fuel both. And that's the wonderful thing about Basic Economy. It is giving our customers choice. So, for those customers who do care about price -- and by the way, at launch this morning, we had a couple of flights go out and smooth and we're encouraged with the initial launch from Minneapolis today. But for our customers who want a lower price, it's fantastic that we can give them that. And for customers who want a higher level of service and who are willing to pay for a higher level of service and a better product, we can give them that as well. This is all about giving our customers' choice, and I think it will happen on both ends. It will make our product more attractive to customers. We are focused on getting the absolute lowest rock-bottom price, and it will also attract customers who would like to have a better level of service and a better product and are willing to pay for that. Hunter Keay Thank you, Scott. Operator  24  From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online. Please go ahead. Savanthi Syth Good morning. Just on the regional space, Scott, it sounds like you're putting these aircraft in kind of mission-appropriate markets. And now that you've had a chance to review the network and maybe adoption rates to increase connectivity, are you still thinking that the regional fleet will be flattish after the year-end 2017 levels? And on that -- the Air Wisconsin deal, I was wondering how big that deal is and if that puts cost pressure or if it's cost neutral. Scott Kirby So conceptually, if there were no constraints, meaning particularly no pilot constraints, we would probably be growing the regional fleet and adding more of those regional markets. To be clear, we wouldn't be flying them in places like Dulles to Chicago or Newark to Atlanta. We will be flying them in places like Rochester, Minnesota, where they're more appropriate. So our regional fleet is less about -- our regional lift is going to be less about our optimal network strategy and much more about our regional partners' ability to source aircraft and pilots, in particular. We -- as a general rule, most of those deals are trading down over time, and we are losing aircraft. That's one of the great things about the Air Wisconsin deal is we were able to go get aircraft that are going to come in at a price that's kind of right in the middle of our prices on other deals, so it's attractive economics and to a large degree, will offset some of the shrinking that we expect to occur at our other regional partners. And we're hoping that our other regional partners can actually keep flying some of those aircraft longer. In fact, SkyWest, [Indiscernible], our numbers have gone up for aircraft at the end of the year because it turns out they're going to be able to fly some of those aircraft a little longer than we thought. But at the end of the day, it's going to be driven -- our regional count -- aircraft count is going to be driven much more by the pilot availability than it is by our optimal fleet plan. Savanthi Syth Got it. Thank you. And Andrew if I might ask a quick question. You might have mentioned this in the opening remarks, but now that you've upped the credit facility, is the cash target, is that unchanged? Or are you changing that as well? Andrew Levy Our cash target remains between $5 billion and $6 billion. That's a range we're comfortable with. And as you can tell, we're well above that at the current time. So, no, we don't expect to change that target range at all. Savanthi Syth Got it. All right, thanks guys. Operator From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead. Darryl Genovesi Hi, thanks for the time. Scott, when you were at American, you embarked on a hub rebanking effort, which I think, in general, leads to a slightly higher-cost operation exchanged -- in exchange for higher revenue. And I wondered if you could use some of the lessons that you learned there to tell us what you think the CASM hit might be over the next couple of years as you try to re-bank the United network. Scott Kirby Look, it does cost more to run a banked operation than otherwise. I think it's pretty small. It was a rounding error at American. It worked really well. It will work really well here. I would point at American to Dulles, which had all the craziness going on with the Wright Amendment and the growth of Spirit, all that just huge headwinds, and yet Dulles was outperforming consistently on PRASM quarter after quarter because of the higher levels of connectivity. So, I'm not sure what the CASM number will be, but I'm highly confident that the increase in revenue will more than offset the PRASM hit. Darryl Genovesi Great. Thank you very much. Operator From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker Andrew, can you give some more color on what's in the other expense category these days? If we look at that as a total -- as a percentage of total operating expense or as a percentage of revenue, there's clearly some growth going on. It's a line item that now has overtaken consolidated fuel expense, for example. What's in there? And what's driving the growth? Andrew Levy Well, there's a lot of items in there, as you noted, Jamie. What we're seeing that's driving the growth in this particular quarter is IT, contracted labor, legal, timing of legal [Indiscernible], which is part of the increase year-over-year; maintenance services, which should be a variety of things, including software support. And also, food is in that line item, and that's also elevated significantly year-over-year, partly driven by the Polaris service launch that occurred at fourth quarter -- late fourth quarter of last year. Jamie Baker Okay, that's helpful. And second question for Scott. As we think about your normal market share in your hubs, and I recognize every hub is going to be different, but how does the -- I mean, does your 2020 margin goals specifically require a level of pricing power that's unattainable unless you increase share by, I don't know, more than 5%, 10%? I mean, basically, can you achieve your margin goal with domestic hub share below 50%, with the exception of Houston? Scott Kirby Well, look, I don't think of it as market share driving pricing power. I think of it more as 2 things: one, driving higher levels of connectivity. When we don't have these higher levels, we have lower levels of connectivity that's high yield [Technical Difficulty] that's completely missing from the network and just giving to your competitors. And second, places like -- let's just take Newark because I talk about it a lot. We have a Newark-based global services or 1K customer, and we started flying the regional jet to Atlanta and regional jets to Dulles and regional jets to Detroit. We pushed that global services customer, who is a high-yield customer, who booked at the last minute to fly on Delta and American in those markets. And beyond that, that customer used to just be a Newark-based customer that was on American -- or United Airlines' frequent flyer program and flew exclusively on United. But now, all of a sudden, anywhere they flew, they decided to go shop because we forced them to carry free frequent flyer cards in their wallet, and because of that, they're no longer global services because they didn't fly on United all the time. We lost those customers. So it's not about pricing power. It's about winning back the loyalty and giving a better product to our best customers so that they choose and want to fly United Airlines. And so -- go ahead. Jamie Baker No, go ahead, sorry. Sorry.  Scott Kirby I was just going to say restoring is not about gaining pricing power or anything like that. It's about creating the best product for our customers in those markets so that they'd want to choose to fly United exclusively. Jamie Baker All right. So, it's more about the quality of the ASMs that you add in your hub than just attaining a share number, in other words. Scott Kirby Absolutely. Jamie Baker Okay. Because I think that point is lost in a lot of investors, so I appreciate you clarifying it. I'm sorry. Did I cut you off, Oscar? Oscar Munoz No. I just wanted to -- I will go back a little bit to your question to Andrew with regards to the other expense category. I think it's important to note that Andrew specifically is leading an initiative to bring down cost in the company across the board, and we had some success in that, and that's what we'd committed. Additionally, with some of the components that we mentioned, I think we have to recognize that they're investments for the customer, right, what do you think of Polaris, what you think of the IT organization. Some of the tools that we rolled out already this year have had a significant level of improvement how we treat our customers. So, we'll continue to manage that and talk a little bit more of that specifically because you will see that cost trend potentially continue. But again, there's initiatives to offset it, plus it's getting a return with regards to our revenue and passenger loads.  Jamie Baker Three thoughtful answers. Thank you very much. Operator From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead. Joseph DeNardi Just two questions on the loyalty program, which hasn't gotten a lot of love today. So Scott, based on the disclosures that United provides around the economics of MileagePlus, it appears that the program is considerably less valuable than American. So American disclosed $1.9 billion marketing revenue in 2016, United disclosed $1.2 billion, American is expecting an incremental $800 million in EBIT by 2018 from the new credit card deal. You're expecting only 8 -- only $300 million. So structurally, is there a reason why United's business of selling miles to third parties is less valuable than American's? Or your disclosures understate the value you received? Scott Kirby I do think that we have different disclosure policies, and this is something we are going to work on. Andrew Levy is nodding his head at me. It's a big initiative for Andrew to figure out how we disclose this better. It's something that we are going to do -- or at least intent to. I think your simplistic analysis -- it would be hard for you to know because we put it in other lines, but isn't right. One thing it is right is that at the moment, Americas' growth rate is much higher. Delta's growth rate also is much higher from today's date. That's the bad news. The good news is, I believe that our partner -- partners at JPMorgan Chase understand that and understand how important it is to get us on the same growth trajectory. We've kind of had a reset of the relationship here in the past few months, and they've committed to getting us to have the same kind of growth rates. And look, we are actually to be growing faster. We're growing faster as an airline. We're growing our capacity faster and so we frankly, ought to be growing faster than those guys. That's not at all on JPMorgan Chase, a lot of that is at United, things like we weren't allowing them to offer the credit card to customers onboard. That's the best acquisition channel that American Airlines had. It was -- I've been told best acquisition channel with Delta and United wasn't doing. So, there are things that we can do to get our growth rates up. We're going need to do it in combination with Chase, but we look forward to getting that accelerated in the months and years to come. Joseph DeNardi So Scott, does that add some upside to what you laid out that Investor Day then? Scott Kirby There's nothing about that in the Investor -- assuming we're successful in that regard it would be upside. Joseph DeNardi Okay. And then Andrew, I guess, what we have done is really just value the business you guys have of -- and other airlines of selling miles to third parties. But I'm just wondering if just bigger picture you can address the opportunity you see for the company just being able to better monetize the 90 million members you have in MileagePlus beyond just selling them air travel? I mean, this is a marketing company essentially. How much is each of those customers worth to you longer term beyond just selling them tickets? Andrew Levy Hey, Joe, let me go back to the first answer by the way. I think Scott hit the nail right on the head. We don't disclose the same way. If we did, the difference in valuation would be much -- or the difference in the numbers that you cited would be much smaller. And so as we mentioned, we're going to work to find a way to disclose this really valuable business in a way that people can understand better because it is unique and very attractive. I think the question you asked about driving incremental revenue, I don't think that's limited to simply MileagePlus members. We communicate with a lot of customers, we carry a lot of customers, we have a lot of this on the website. And we've talked a lot about different ways we can monetize or do a better job of monetizing the eyeballs that reach our website and the members of our mileage program and how to enhance our mileage program. So, I think that, that hasn't been the first priority. We're focused on the things we talked about at Investor Day, which were kind of foundational. But it is the focus of ours, and we've had a number of discussions and at some point, we will really put a lot more time and effort into backsliding the opportunity there, which we do agree with you it exist and is quite substantial but really hard to quantify it. Joseph DeNardi Thank you very much. Operator From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski Hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions and Oscar, appreciate the comments. Accidents happen and I think your hard-working frontline in place probably deserve a little bit more credit than all the negative media attention. So hopefully, we can put this behind us. But from an investor perspective, I think, Scott, what folks are worried about here is that we saw the capacity increase domestically in the past month, one and a half. The concern here is that maybe we're a little bit more focused on market share than margins. You've benchmarked to Delta publicly. Their guidance for 2Q is a good bit ahead of you here although you are showing a lot of sequential improvement in 2Q as well. So, how can you re-ensure your investor base here that this capacity addition indeed is restructuring the network to help you capture that margin Delta and that we should be thinking this is going to be quite accretive as we move into 2018? Scott Kirby Well, look, we used the term -- I try to avoid actually market share and try to say natural share more often than market share because this is not a play to go get market share. This is really about restoring United to its natural share. And United get a lot -- took a lot of accidents in the past three to four years, which caused it to lose its natural share and which hurt its financials. And you guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why aren't your financials good. And you gave them a cure for that, which was cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity and it just made the problem worse. And despite taking the same medicine quarter-after-quarter as the numbers got worse and worse and worse that was part of the problem when the airline was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places that set the network like Rochester, Minnesota and redeploying them in places like Newark to Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low. That was driving margins lower. And so I'm trying to be careful to say what we're doing is restoring United to its natural market share, to a position it was in the past, and it's working so far. I mean, it's actually working faster even than I would have thought, the fact that our guidance with this cutting capacity is for RASM up 1% to 3%. And by the way, we've got number of issues that are driving about -- our flown PRASM is actually higher than that. We've got some accounting issues that are going to be 50 to 70 basis points headwind in this quarter. Those are just the things that happened, but our core performance is even stronger. I mean, we just -- early on, we feel really good about how well this is working. It's logical. This is not trying to go invade someone's hub. This is about restoring United to where it should've been and we had some unforced errors. And we were double faulting and giving points to the competitors, and we've stopped double faulting and that, I think, is just going to be getting us back to our natural market share. I don't think it's disruptive. I wouldn't describe the reason that we're doing as disruptive. We're just returning to where United's natural market shares. We're going to be very careful to calibrate how it's working and how we're doing. We're only a few months into this, but I tell you, we're off to a really good start. We won't be perfect, we'll stumble. I mean we had a stumble last week in operations. We'll have stumbles on the commercial side, but we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. Oscar Munoz And I would just add, Brandon, and reiterate what I think I said a couple of times publicly. This is a thoughtful approach with lots of team members involved. Andrew Nocella has just joined us, and joined the team and is really in charge of most of that day in and day out. So really thoughtful, but at the same time opportunistic because it is a unique opportunity as Scott outlined that we have and the list of opportunities continues to be a fairly large one, how we do it in a thoughtful balanced way is sort of the course of the day. But I can tell you that market share is not a conversation we have in this room or with our board, it is all about margin. And so, again, I just want to reiterate that point. Brandon Oglenski Okay. Oscar, I appreciate that. But I think you even said it publicly before this is a not a shift in long-term strategy that United is about to grow capacity now at or above GDP. This is, indeed, a shift in the network, is that incorrect? Oscar Munoz I'm sorry?  Scott Kirby Yes, I think that's probably correct. I'm not sure I'd say exactly that. This is not an attempt to go build an empire and go win the market share. It is an attempt to restore United to its natural position. And once there, I would anticipate we will be growing in line with GDP.  Brandon Oglenski All right. Appreciate it. Operator From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora online. Please go ahead. Andrew Didora Hi good morning everyone. Thank you for question. I guess, Scott, asking the capacity question another way, we can see there's a three to four percentage point pick up in your main line utilization in the back half of the year from June through December. This does put you ahead of where the other legacies are and kind of closer to your big LCC competition. Is there the ability to push this even -- is there the ability to push this even higher or you've kind of maxed out with where you are on the current fleet? Scott Kirby Okay, you're just talking about our utilization? Andrew Didora Yes, main line. Scott Kirby Yes, certainly in the back half of the year, if we wanted to, we could push utilization higher. The utilization is lower in the first and fourth quarters because demand is lower. And so we could push it higher, but -- and not -- to guarantee that we won't change it at all, but it's a much bigger hurdle. It's operationally easy to push it higher, it's financially harder to justify pushing it higher in off peak periods. Andrew Didora Got it. And then just -- haven't had much discussion on Trans-Atlantic, the numbers in 1Q and the 2Q guidance was actually much better than I was expecting given all the -- low-cost competition coming on. What have you -- what are some of the actions you've taken on the Trans-Atlantic to help offset some of this kind of new flying that's coming in? Scott Kirby So, at least for the Star Alliance and so forth, United and flying to the Star Alliance countries, we have not restructured pricing in those markets. And the Sky Team and Oneworld Alliance, pricing has been restructured and lowered. We keep track of the lowest published fares by AP across our whole system, and those aren't always selling fares because yield management bucket sell out at different airlines. But the Sky Team and Oneworld markets fares -- advance purchase fares are down, call it 20% to 30%. They're down about 10% in the Star Alliance markets because there are growth of low-cost carriers and other things that drive those down, but our pricing is much better in those markets than in the other markets. Now, of course, we carry a lot of revenue to those countries, we carry a lot of revenues in the U.K. and to Paris, so we're impacted by that. But we are less impacted by that. Also, at least, in this portion of the year, we're disproportionately selling U.S. point of sale and U.S. point of sale is really strong. I will caution you that as we move to the back half of the summer, the normal demand pattern shifts to European point-of-sale. And so I would expect RASM to be still be high-capacity. RASM to be under more pressure in the back half because once people starts going back to school here in the U.S., the second half of that peak summer season is really much more about Europeans coming to the U.S. and so I'd anticipate in the third quarter a little more weakness just given the European point-of-sale was weak -- was strong. Andrew Didora Great. Thank you. Operator From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani Scott, a couple of quick questions for you. Just first, on your comments on restoring natural market share. What's the timeline to actually get that? Is that a one, two-year thing, a 10-year thing? How are you envisioning it? Scott Kirby I think we don't know yet, that's for TBD. And I don't think we can --- even if we could do a complete analysis and it just depends on what -- on how the markets evolving and how the new flying and new routes are going to be doing. It's really bottoms up analysis, We're not trying to do a top down and say, here's where we're going to be X years from now, we're doing bottoms up one by one, we're watching the performance of those routes as we up-guage them, or as we add new routes. And it's going to be a judgment that's based on how those things are doing when we get to the point where we're adding flying, and it's not margin accretive, then we'll know probably reach that point. But that's probably going to be the metric where we've decided we've reached that point. Rajeev Lalwani Okay. And post your decision to adjust your capacity for the year, what kind of response have you seen from some of your peers and some of the markets where you're at, or have you not seen any real response? Scott Kirby Look, it's -- we're trying to do it what's right for United Airlines. And because what I think we're doing is really about -- we're not trying to invade someone's market, or do -- we're not trying to create a competitive battle, we are trying to compete that I wouldn't have expected and haven't seen much response. I mean, look, take a market like Newark to Atlanta where 5 years ago, we flew 8 mainline flights or call it 150 seats per flight, and so we had 1,200 seats a day in that market. Delta flew 12 mainlines so you can call it 12x150, so they had 1,800 seats. We were 40% of the market; they were 60% of the market. We shot that down to 6 50-seat regional jets, so were down to 300. And so we were -- and Delta stayed at 1,800 that whole time. And so we were one seventh of the market from 40%. We've now quadrupled our capacity and gone back to 1,200 seats today. And we're back -- right back to where we were before. We're at 40% of the market. I think that's probably the natural share between Newark to Atlanta. Atlanta is a bigger hub with more connectivity and that 40-60 ratio is probably about right. Is it possible that Delta is going to decide to quadruple capacity and go for flying -- in every bank, they're already flying every bank, 12 flights today, are they going to try to fly 48 flights today? I doubt it. That hasn't happened. It wouldn't be rational. So I guess I'd say because of the kind of capacity that we're adding or we're re-upgauging, some of those hub-to-hub markets, and we're adding competitive capacity or adding capacity in places like Chicago to Rochester, Minnesota, we didn't anticipate a respond and we certainly don't think we've seen one. And that's about all we said now. Rajeev Lalwani If I could sneak in one quick one. Scott, you've provided some good color on the Trans-Atlantic market. How are you thinking about Asia? Scott Kirby Well, Asia has been the region under the most pressure because the capacity -- incredibly high growth in capacity. As we get to the second half of this year, we're through the bilateral, particularly to Beijing and Shanghai so capacity growth will moderate in those cities. There are still awful lot of capacity coming from secondary cities. So United is one of the first -- well, the only U.S. airlines -- one of the first airlines to the party and flying to those secondary cities. But it's -- that's going to continue to be a challenge, particularly with the kind of subsidies that people are getting to open up new routes out of China from secondary cities. But the core of China, which is really about Beijing and Shanghai looks like capacity will moderate in the back half of the year. So, we're hopeful that the Pacific PRASM will start to improve in the back half. Rajeev Lalwani Thank you. Operator From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth  Hey, thanks. I was hoping to hear from Greg Hart. Is he on the line? GregoryHart Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth  Hey Greg. As you're thinking about this plan to grow domestic capacity, nearly 6% in the June quarter, it would be great to hear from you, your level of involvement in that aggressive plans, what preparations you've made, what lead times look like for staffing and training. And then what gives you confidence that United historically more careful approach to utilization flying is now able to change? Gregory Hart Yes, thanks for the question, Duane. I would say that we've been working on our capability to do this sort of thing for years, and this isn't something we started working on over the past couple of months. We've been focused on developing systems processes, the health of our fleet and lots of other things to make sure that we had the capability to do this. My team has been involved, along with the finance team and Scott's team in every step of the way here and in fact, I feel really comfortable as does the rest of the team that we're going to be able to deliver on what we've committed to and our performance here before would suggest that we've got a great structure in place to allow us to do that. And of course, our employees are really excited about the opportunity to grow the airline again. Duane Pfennigwerth  Okay, I appreciate that comment and that it was years in the making. It's -- it is keen to surprise your finance team for what it's worth when this first started to show up in the schedules. With respect to calibration which, I think, is the most interesting word I heard on this call, United has low relative margins. Those margins are still declining and the company's proposed solution to correcting that is a higher growth rate. So going back to Rajeev's question, how will you measure if that proposed solution is working? And I think investors deserve more than kind of a 4-year goal. What is the timeframe by which you'll measure if it's working that would lead to potential calibration? Scott Kirby Look, we're measuring today and our principal metrics are going to be absolute and relative margin. That doesn't mean quarter-to-quarter because there's going to be fuel price spikes and there's going to be fuel price decline and there's going to be timing of labor deals at our airline or other airlines. But we look at our relative and absolute margins, and we look at it over kind of a trailing 12-month period, and it adjust for things like fuel hedge losses. And those numbers look like we're doing a good job today, and we feel pretty confident. We believe that, that's going to work going forward. I mean, you look at least relative to Delta. In the first quarter, we had higher RASM, better CASM performance, so a lot of other moving pieces in that hedge losses and things that make the numbers a little hard to look at. But that would imply that we're closing the margin gap. Expect we will do so; continue to do so as we move through the rest of the year. And we just -- we feel really good about the path that we're on. We think we are moving towards sustainably closing both the absolute improvement in margins and relative to RASM gap, but that's what we're going to look at and we're not waiting for you to look at that, we're looking at that every day. Oscar Munoz And I would just cap it off with that that is big component of our long-term compensation plan. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From the Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead. David Koenig Yes, good morning. This is for Oscar. I know you're talking about April 30, but I wonder if you could give any more light on what you're thinking about, and specifically are you considering in response to what happened last week on United Express, are you considering simply ending involuntary denied boardings with all the sales policy changes that, that entails. Oscar Munoz Hey David. We are looking at a broad array of issues that affected not only that situation or our broader customer experience. And so we are hard at work at that and have been for the last few days and I'll ask all of you to wait until that time when we talk about it. David Koenig You can't rule that in or out? Oscar Munoz I think I would rather wait until we've done the full work and then we'll report on it next week. Operator From Bloomberg News, we have Michael Sasso. Please go ahead. Michael Sasso Yes. There's certainly was some conjecture that somebody could lose his job over the situation last week. Can you say at the board level or in the management level, was there any of that founded? Was there ever talk of anyone losing their job within management, lower down? Oscar Munoz This is Oscar. Michael, the buck stops here, and I'm sure, there was lots of conjecture about me personally. I think I've met with the board and the board has met independently and we've had fulsome conversations that I'll be involved in some of that work that we're doing, going forward as well as they always have been. I have issued the letter of support, but to your specific question, again, it was a system failure across various areas. So no, there was never a consideration for firing an employee or anyone around it. Operator From THE STREET, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead. Ted Reed Thank you. Speaking about changes comparisons with Delta. Delta always says they have a revenue premium. This could -- they said 108%. Do you have a revenue premium to the airline industry? Scott Kirby Well, Ted, I hate that metric because if we calculate the numbers here at United, yes, we have a revenue premium and yes, it's higher even than Delta. American also, by the way, when I got there said they had a revenue premium. Because everyone makes all these adjustments to the numbers on stage length and density and a whole bunch of other stuff and so with all the caveats everyone calculates that they have a revenue premium. I think margin is what matters. You can make your revenue premium go up by taking a row of seats off airplanes, for example, and that makes your RASM get higher. You could fly only first class seats on airplanes, and that will make your RASM higher and we give you a revenue premium and have a real cost problem. And so I think looking at margin, we are focused on margin, in closing the margin gap and improving our absolute and relative margin.  Ted Reed All right. I would also like to ask there was this reaction in China to the incident. Have you seen any impact on China bookings because of that incident last week? Scott Kirby We've only had a few days and it's a small numbers problem. There's a lot of volatility in bookings for point-of-sale China, so it's really too early for us to say anything about it. Oscar Munoz And Ted, it's Oscar. I would add that there certainly has been some sentiment and I did visit with the Chinese Consulate here locally to discuss that with them. And I will be heading out there in a couple weeks to have further conversations with customers and related governmental officials. Ted Reed You mean in reaction to this, you're going to make a China trip? Oscar Munoz No, it's been a trip that was planned for some time. There was a lot of other activities going on. It's just a normal travel that I'll do as we run a fairly global airline and we have lots of occasions and employees out there as well as customers. Ted Reed All right. Thank you. Operator And from CNN, we have John (inaudible). Unidentified Analyst Hey good morning. A question about -- you just spoke about corporate customers earlier. How are you seeing an effect at all on leisure customers and in the overall trends in the wake of last week's incident? Scott Kirby Again, it's really too early for us to tell anything about bookings and in particular last week because it was the week before Easter, that's normally a very low booking period, so we just really don't have any quantifiable data. Our forecast for the quarter didn't change at all. We do a weekly forecast that stays to the tenth of a percent exactly the same as it was before, but it's just really hard for us to look at data in the week before Easter and have a good view of whether there was a measurable bookings impact or not? Oscar Munoz And John, I would just add that I've sent out a personal note to a person who is legit, intimate things you can sent to hundreds of thousands of people but to our -- at least at this point, to our most loyal customers and the response rate has been pretty high and positive. Obviously, a lot of people have ideas and thoughts about how we can make things better. But in that particular segment of our highest end customers, there's been a lot of support. Unidentified Analyst And Oscar, in that same vein, I mean, your rival in September 2015 really focused on a creating more employee-focused culture. I'm curious just kind of to go back to the early parts of last week and your comments about emphatically supporting employees. And that statement seems to rile people up more in regards to the characterization around Dr. Dao's behavior. I just want to kind of go back and kind of get inside your head for how you were trying to walk a line between your relations with your employees and your relations with your customer, and if you feel you got that balance right early in the week and how you kind of felt you need to make a pivot later in the week? Oscar Munoz Thanks. Listen, customers have always been first, but I think the evolution of our company, we needed to regain the trust of our employees first before they can do that. And if you think about -- your question about what's in my head and why it was important to support our employees as well as keep customer focus is that customer service at the end of the day, is not about a policy or a procedure or a tool, it's about values, human values, and that we cannot lose because if I lost that with that many thousands -- tens of thousands of employees, we'd be in a very much more difficult situation. So as far as I look at it, it's about values, not protocol. Operator And finally from Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead. Edward Russell Andrew, I wanted to ask a bit more about the 12 737 that are purchased off lease. I was wondering if you can break down with the variants are 700, 800, 900 and who the lessors were that you purchased this from? Andrew Levy The aircraft were split evenly between 737-700s and 737-800s and the seller was GECAS. Edward Russell Great. Thank you very much. Andrew Levy Thanks. Julie Yates Stewart All right, thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Media Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

[Operator Instructions] And from Cowen, we have Helane Becker online. Please go ahead. Helane Becker Thanks very much operator. Hi everybody. Thank you very much for your time. Just on the bookings over the past -- I mean, this is like very short-term-focused, but are you hearing from any of your corporate accounts about adjusting bookings or whatever for the -- given United's performance over the last couple of weeks with various incidences? Scott Kirby We had a lot of communication with our corporate accounts, and we've had appropriate questions and concerns, particularly with regard to our corporate accounts, with whom we have a good relationship and we've already communicated with. We feel pretty good about the communications that we've had so far and in our ability to reassure them and explain things like overbooking. Some of the steps that we will do with the broader public on our April 30 launch but some of that with our corporate accounts, we've been able to accelerate some of that -- some of their specific concerns. And our sales team has done a wonderful job of being out, talking to them if there has been a concern from corporate accounts, which has been totally appropriate. We feel like we've managed that pretty well. And our corporate accounts are largely supportive. They want us to fix this. They want us to do the right thing. But they believe in us and believe that we will get this fixed. And at the end of the day, we will be stronger, and we will have better customer service when we get through this.  Oscar Munoz And Helane, this is Oscar. I echo the same sentiments. I've had -- go ahead, Helane. Helane Becker No. I was just actually -- I mean, I don't want to beat this up. I just was going to change the subject and actually ask you about regional -- regions in the domestic market. I know you were talking about improvement in various domestic markets, and I wonder if there are any specific areas of improvement that you would call out as being noteworthy. And that was all. Scott Kirby Well, we saw improvement -- we saw PRASM up, actually, the most in Houston. To some degree, that's -- we have less capacity in Houston. We're looking forward to actually re-banking Houston starting later this year, which will allow us the platform to grow Houston and actually improve PRASM even more. The energy sector in Houston, while still down significantly compared to where it was historically, is starting to at least recover from a very low base. Our energy accounts have [rounding up] [ph] 13% during the quarter. We also saw strength in Dulles and Chicago, and the rest of the hubs, while down a little bit, were all down pretty marginally. So really, I would say for the most part, across the board, we're starting to see an improved revenue environment, and we really feel good about the revenue environment, really, across the board. Helane Becker Great. Thank you very much. Operator From Citigroup, we have Kevin Crissey online. Please go ahead. Kevin Crissey Good morning. Thanks for the time. Can we talk about the international partners maybe in a big picture, the evolution of the international partnerships, their importance overall, where your strengths and opportunities exist, maybe just a big picture on where international partnerships and alliances and JVs, as you see it, are heading? Thank you. Scott Kirby Well, international JV and partnerships are incredibly important to our customers. They are a way to give a seamless experience to our customers, to get them around the world. This is one of those rare events that if they win, win, win; it's a win for United Airlines. It could be a win for our partners, and it's absolutely a win for our customers. I think we -- and Star Alliance, we all believe that we have an opportunity to do better. We can be more seamlessly integrated with one another and that includes on the commercial front, but to a large degree, that includes the customer experience, where we can make the experience more seamless. And we have a new CEO at Star Alliance, and that is his number one mission. I'll actually be going to the Star Alliance meeting on Mother's Day, which my wife doesn't appreciate, but it's in Germany. And the focus of the meeting is to talk about how we can create a more seamless experience for our customers and really have the focus to be on customers. And we think there's a big opportunity there, and that's something that we'll be working on over the coming years. But our partnerships are really important, and we're looking forward to expanding partnerships, particularly in Latin America with Avianca and Copa, and we think there's a real opportunity. But we have strong partnerships across the Atlantic and Pacific. Adding Avianca, Copa and Azul to those relationships is going to give us the ability to give the American and LatAm a run for their money in Latin America. Kevin Crissey So Scott, would you say that that's the region where you have the biggest opportunity for improvement is in the Latin America region? Scott Kirby Well, we have opportunity for improvement everywhere, but it's the least developed region for us. So yes, it's the area with the most opportunity for improvement. Kevin Crissey Thank you for your time. Operator We have Michael Linenberg on the line. Please standby for just a moment. Michael Linenberg is on the line, please go ahead sir. Michael Linenberg Yes, hey thanks. Two questions here. Hey, Scott, I just want to go back to -- you mentioned Houston, Dulles and Chicago seeing PRASM improvement. Just specifically looking at Newark, if it weren't for the fact that Newark-Florida fares were somewhat depressed, if we were to exclude that, would have Newark's PRASM been up? Scott Kirby Newark what fares? Michael Linenberg If you were to exclude -- to Florida. Scott Kirby Excluding Florida. I mean, Newark was down 1%, and so I don't know. And actually, what's happened in Newark is there was a flood of low-cost carrier capacity, and for a long time, United Airlines did not match the prices. We started matching the prices and I think our revenues, while down in those markets, is down less than it was before. So, we feel really good about that strategy. At least our incremental change in strategy and competing more aggressively with the low-cost carriers in Newark, I think, is revenue positive. To be clear, with all the capacity in Florida, PRASM is certainly down, but it was down even more before we decided to start competing aggressively.  Michael Linenberg Well. And then just my second question, Andrew, you talked about growing the fleet with used aircraft. And I guess up until this point, you've -- predominantly, it's -- well, I shouldn't say predominantly, it's all been narrow-body. And I'm curious about your thoughts about used wide-bodies. I think the view out in the marketplace is that reconfiguration costs are too high. Hence, we don't see airlines really look at used wide-bodies. I mean, what are your thoughts on that? Are there opportunities there for you, if you can elaborate?  Andrew Levy Yes. Hey, Mike. Michael Linenberg Hey. Andrew Levy The wide-body market is severely depressed across the board. There's tremendous opportunities in the used market. There's a lot of really good high-quality aircraft available at very, very attractive low rates. So you're right that the reconfiguration costs are certainly more significant, and it's, perhaps, a little bit tougher to make the economics work in a normal situation. Certainly, with the -- today, I think we're in a different period in the market, and so we are actively looking at wide-bodies and narrow-bodies and we'll see. I think obviously, the weakness in demand for that sector has been well documented. It's nothing new. And I know the OEMs are feeling it as well. So, we'll see if we can take advantage of the dislocations that we believe is there and will continue to be there for quite some time. Michael Linenberg Great. Thanks Andrew. Andrew Levy Thanks. Operator From Wolfe Research, we have Hunter Keay on the line. Please go ahead. Hunter Keay Hey good morning. Scott, at the Analyst Day in November, you said that historically, inflections in RASM usually involve a couple months of nail-biting, where you're behind on advance bookings, which is exactly what's happening, obviously, in slide six. So we're obviously more than a couple months into it at this point. So I guess the question is, are you deep enough into this point where you can say that you're seeing that big turn, which is what you described it as in November, in the revenue environment? Or do you need a couple more months to go before you can safely say that we have had that big turn, which are your words that you said in November? Scott Kirby Well, Hunter, you've followed me long enough to know that I'm an optimist by nature, so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt. But yes, I think we had a great turn in revenue in the fourth quarter. If you can just look at that graph, I think it was slide, what, six or seven for us and you can see going from RASM that is down 7.4%, down 6.6%, down 5.8%, all of a sudden to down 1.6%. That's a big step function change and there really wasn't a big change in industry capacity at that point, not a flat, not up to -- something changed in the fourth quarter. And my hypothesis is that what changed in the fourth quarter was United's revenue management philosophy, which leads to a pricing philosophy change and that has changed and we expect things to continue to grow. What's not even in these numbers which will bear in the second half of the year is Basic Economy, which we think is going to be really big, predictably by the time we get it at steady state. But I think there was inflection point in the fourth quarter and I feel pretty good that that has happened. Hunter Keay Okay. And this is actually sort of a related question. You mentioned Basic Economy. I want to get back to a question asked a few months ago about distribution as well. In an ideal world, if you're able to get the distribution paradigm sort of adjusted to exactly how you want it to be. Is there more of an opportunity to drive incremental revenues at the really, really low end like through things like Basic Economy or at the really, really high end by turning airlines into -- dynamically, you're competing on things like product and schedule, with price way at the bottom of the list. So, the question is, low-end or high-end opportunity as it relates to the distribution changes that you expect over the next couple of years. Scott Kirby Well, I think that there's opportunity on both. At United, and I said this at my previous airline, roughly half of our revenue is coming from infrequent customers and half is coming from premium customers, customers that fly as often. And it's a little over simplistic to say that, that half of revenue coming from infrequent customers just cares about price because a lot them care about more than that. It's also -- the flip side is true that some of our frequent customers are really shopping on price as well. But at a high level, you can think of it simplistically as half and half and we need to fuel both. And that's the wonderful thing about Basic Economy. It is giving our customers choice. So, for those customers who do care about price -- and by the way, at launch this morning, we had a couple of flights go out and smooth and we're encouraged with the initial launch from Minneapolis today. But for our customers who want a lower price, it's fantastic that we can give them that. And for customers who want a higher level of service and who are willing to pay for a higher level of service and a better product, we can give them that as well. This is all about giving our customers' choice, and I think it will happen on both ends. It will make our product more attractive to customers. We are focused on getting the absolute lowest rock-bottom price, and it will also attract customers who would like to have a better level of service and a better product and are willing to pay for that. Hunter Keay Thank you, Scott. Operator  24  From Raymond James, we have Savi Syth online. Please go ahead. Savanthi Syth Good morning. Just on the regional space, Scott, it sounds like you're putting these aircraft in kind of mission-appropriate markets. And now that you've had a chance to review the network and maybe adoption rates to increase connectivity, are you still thinking that the regional fleet will be flattish after the year-end 2017 levels? And on that -- the Air Wisconsin deal, I was wondering how big that deal is and if that puts cost pressure or if it's cost neutral. Scott Kirby So conceptually, if there were no constraints, meaning particularly no pilot constraints, we would probably be growing the regional fleet and adding more of those regional markets. To be clear, we wouldn't be flying them in places like Dulles to Chicago or Newark to Atlanta. We will be flying them in places like Rochester, Minnesota, where they're more appropriate. So our regional fleet is less about -- our regional lift is going to be less about our optimal network strategy and much more about our regional partners' ability to source aircraft and pilots, in particular. We -- as a general rule, most of those deals are trading down over time, and we are losing aircraft. That's one of the great things about the Air Wisconsin deal is we were able to go get aircraft that are going to come in at a price that's kind of right in the middle of our prices on other deals, so it's attractive economics and to a large degree, will offset some of the shrinking that we expect to occur at our other regional partners. And we're hoping that our other regional partners can actually keep flying some of those aircraft longer. In fact, SkyWest, [Indiscernible], our numbers have gone up for aircraft at the end of the year because it turns out they're going to be able to fly some of those aircraft a little longer than we thought. But at the end of the day, it's going to be driven -- our regional count -- aircraft count is going to be driven much more by the pilot availability than it is by our optimal fleet plan. Savanthi Syth Got it. Thank you. And Andrew if I might ask a quick question. You might have mentioned this in the opening remarks, but now that you've upped the credit facility, is the cash target, is that unchanged? Or are you changing that as well? Andrew Levy Our cash target remains between $5 billion and $6 billion. That's a range we're comfortable with. And as you can tell, we're well above that at the current time. So, no, we don't expect to change that target range at all. Savanthi Syth Got it. All right, thanks guys. Operator From UBS, we have Darryl Genovesi. Please go ahead. Darryl Genovesi Hi, thanks for the time. Scott, when you were at American, you embarked on a hub rebanking effort, which I think, in general, leads to a slightly higher-cost operation exchanged -- in exchange for higher revenue. And I wondered if you could use some of the lessons that you learned there to tell us what you think the CASM hit might be over the next couple of years as you try to re-bank the United network. Scott Kirby Look, it does cost more to run a banked operation than otherwise. I think it's pretty small. It was a rounding error at American. It worked really well. It will work really well here. I would point at American to Dulles, which had all the craziness going on with the Wright Amendment and the growth of Spirit, all that just huge headwinds, and yet Dulles was outperforming consistently on PRASM quarter after quarter because of the higher levels of connectivity. So, I'm not sure what the CASM number will be, but I'm highly confident that the increase in revenue will more than offset the PRASM hit. Darryl Genovesi Great. Thank you very much. Operator From JPMorgan, we have Jamie Baker online. Please go ahead. Jamie Baker Andrew, can you give some more color on what's in the other expense category these days? If we look at that as a total -- as a percentage of total operating expense or as a percentage of revenue, there's clearly some growth going on. It's a line item that now has overtaken consolidated fuel expense, for example. What's in there? And what's driving the growth? Andrew Levy Well, there's a lot of items in there, as you noted, Jamie. What we're seeing that's driving the growth in this particular quarter is IT, contracted labor, legal, timing of legal [Indiscernible], which is part of the increase year-over-year; maintenance services, which should be a variety of things, including software support. And also, food is in that line item, and that's also elevated significantly year-over-year, partly driven by the Polaris service launch that occurred at fourth quarter -- late fourth quarter of last year. Jamie Baker Okay, that's helpful. And second question for Scott. As we think about your normal market share in your hubs, and I recognize every hub is going to be different, but how does the -- I mean, does your 2020 margin goals specifically require a level of pricing power that's unattainable unless you increase share by, I don't know, more than 5%, 10%? I mean, basically, can you achieve your margin goal with domestic hub share below 50%, with the exception of Houston? Scott Kirby Well, look, I don't think of it as market share driving pricing power. I think of it more as 2 things: one, driving higher levels of connectivity. When we don't have these higher levels, we have lower levels of connectivity that's high yield [Technical Difficulty] that's completely missing from the network and just giving to your competitors. And second, places like -- let's just take Newark because I talk about it a lot. We have a Newark-based global services or 1K customer, and we started flying the regional jet to Atlanta and regional jets to Dulles and regional jets to Detroit. We pushed that global services customer, who is a high-yield customer, who booked at the last minute to fly on Delta and American in those markets. And beyond that, that customer used to just be a Newark-based customer that was on American -- or United Airlines' frequent flyer program and flew exclusively on United. But now, all of a sudden, anywhere they flew, they decided to go shop because we forced them to carry free frequent flyer cards in their wallet, and because of that, they're no longer global services because they didn't fly on United all the time. We lost those customers. So it's not about pricing power. It's about winning back the loyalty and giving a better product to our best customers so that they choose and want to fly United Airlines. And so -- go ahead. Jamie Baker No, go ahead, sorry. Sorry.  Scott Kirby I was just going to say restoring is not about gaining pricing power or anything like that. It's about creating the best product for our customers in those markets so that they'd want to choose to fly United exclusively. Jamie Baker All right. So, it's more about the quality of the ASMs that you add in your hub than just attaining a share number, in other words. Scott Kirby Absolutely. Jamie Baker Okay. Because I think that point is lost in a lot of investors, so I appreciate you clarifying it. I'm sorry. Did I cut you off, Oscar? Oscar Munoz No. I just wanted to -- I will go back a little bit to your question to Andrew with regards to the other expense category. I think it's important to note that Andrew specifically is leading an initiative to bring down cost in the company across the board, and we had some success in that, and that's what we'd committed. Additionally, with some of the components that we mentioned, I think we have to recognize that they're investments for the customer, right, what do you think of Polaris, what you think of the IT organization. Some of the tools that we rolled out already this year have had a significant level of improvement how we treat our customers. So, we'll continue to manage that and talk a little bit more of that specifically because you will see that cost trend potentially continue. But again, there's initiatives to offset it, plus it's getting a return with regards to our revenue and passenger loads.  Jamie Baker Three thoughtful answers. Thank you very much. Operator From Stifel, we have Joseph DeNardi. Please go ahead. Joseph DeNardi Just two questions on the loyalty program, which hasn't gotten a lot of love today. So Scott, based on the disclosures that United provides around the economics of MileagePlus, it appears that the program is considerably less valuable than American. So American disclosed $1.9 billion marketing revenue in 2016, United disclosed $1.2 billion, American is expecting an incremental $800 million in EBIT by 2018 from the new credit card deal. You're expecting only 8 -- only $300 million. So structurally, is there a reason why United's business of selling miles to third parties is less valuable than American's? Or your disclosures understate the value you received? Scott Kirby I do think that we have different disclosure policies, and this is something we are going to work on. Andrew Levy is nodding his head at me. It's a big initiative for Andrew to figure out how we disclose this better. It's something that we are going to do -- or at least intent to. I think your simplistic analysis -- it would be hard for you to know because we put it in other lines, but isn't right. One thing it is right is that at the moment, Americas' growth rate is much higher. Delta's growth rate also is much higher from today's date. That's the bad news. The good news is, I believe that our partner -- partners at JPMorgan Chase understand that and understand how important it is to get us on the same growth trajectory. We've kind of had a reset of the relationship here in the past few months, and they've committed to getting us to have the same kind of growth rates. And look, we are actually to be growing faster. We're growing faster as an airline. We're growing our capacity faster and so we frankly, ought to be growing faster than those guys. That's not at all on JPMorgan Chase, a lot of that is at United, things like we weren't allowing them to offer the credit card to customers onboard. That's the best acquisition channel that American Airlines had. It was -- I've been told best acquisition channel with Delta and United wasn't doing. So, there are things that we can do to get our growth rates up. We're going need to do it in combination with Chase, but we look forward to getting that accelerated in the months and years to come. Joseph DeNardi So Scott, does that add some upside to what you laid out that Investor Day then? Scott Kirby There's nothing about that in the Investor -- assuming we're successful in that regard it would be upside. Joseph DeNardi Okay. And then Andrew, I guess, what we have done is really just value the business you guys have of -- and other airlines of selling miles to third parties. But I'm just wondering if just bigger picture you can address the opportunity you see for the company just being able to better monetize the 90 million members you have in MileagePlus beyond just selling them air travel? I mean, this is a marketing company essentially. How much is each of those customers worth to you longer term beyond just selling them tickets? Andrew Levy Hey, Joe, let me go back to the first answer by the way. I think Scott hit the nail right on the head. We don't disclose the same way. If we did, the difference in valuation would be much -- or the difference in the numbers that you cited would be much smaller. And so as we mentioned, we're going to work to find a way to disclose this really valuable business in a way that people can understand better because it is unique and very attractive. I think the question you asked about driving incremental revenue, I don't think that's limited to simply MileagePlus members. We communicate with a lot of customers, we carry a lot of customers, we have a lot of this on the website. And we've talked a lot about different ways we can monetize or do a better job of monetizing the eyeballs that reach our website and the members of our mileage program and how to enhance our mileage program. So, I think that, that hasn't been the first priority. We're focused on the things we talked about at Investor Day, which were kind of foundational. But it is the focus of ours, and we've had a number of discussions and at some point, we will really put a lot more time and effort into backsliding the opportunity there, which we do agree with you it exist and is quite substantial but really hard to quantify it. Joseph DeNardi Thank you very much. Operator From Barclays, we have Brandon Oglenski. Please go ahead. Brandon Oglenski Hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions and Oscar, appreciate the comments. Accidents happen and I think your hard-working frontline in place probably deserve a little bit more credit than all the negative media attention. So hopefully, we can put this behind us. But from an investor perspective, I think, Scott, what folks are worried about here is that we saw the capacity increase domestically in the past month, one and a half. The concern here is that maybe we're a little bit more focused on market share than margins. You've benchmarked to Delta publicly. Their guidance for 2Q is a good bit ahead of you here although you are showing a lot of sequential improvement in 2Q as well. So, how can you re-ensure your investor base here that this capacity addition indeed is restructuring the network to help you capture that margin Delta and that we should be thinking this is going to be quite accretive as we move into 2018? Scott Kirby Well, look, we used the term -- I try to avoid actually market share and try to say natural share more often than market share because this is not a play to go get market share. This is really about restoring United to its natural share. And United get a lot -- took a lot of accidents in the past three to four years, which caused it to lose its natural share and which hurt its financials. And you guys used to get on this earnings call and beat them up about why aren't your financials good. And you gave them a cure for that, which was cut capacity, cut capacity, cut capacity and it just made the problem worse. And despite taking the same medicine quarter-after-quarter as the numbers got worse and worse and worse that was part of the problem when the airline was cutting capacity and taking regional jets out of places that set the network like Rochester, Minnesota and redeploying them in places like Newark to Atlanta, in order to keep capacity low. That was driving margins lower. And so I'm trying to be careful to say what we're doing is restoring United to its natural market share, to a position it was in the past, and it's working so far. I mean, it's actually working faster even than I would have thought, the fact that our guidance with this cutting capacity is for RASM up 1% to 3%. And by the way, we've got number of issues that are driving about -- our flown PRASM is actually higher than that. We've got some accounting issues that are going to be 50 to 70 basis points headwind in this quarter. Those are just the things that happened, but our core performance is even stronger. I mean, we just -- early on, we feel really good about how well this is working. It's logical. This is not trying to go invade someone's hub. This is about restoring United to where it should've been and we had some unforced errors. And we were double faulting and giving points to the competitors, and we've stopped double faulting and that, I think, is just going to be getting us back to our natural market share. I don't think it's disruptive. I wouldn't describe the reason that we're doing as disruptive. We're just returning to where United's natural market shares. We're going to be very careful to calibrate how it's working and how we're doing. We're only a few months into this, but I tell you, we're off to a really good start. We won't be perfect, we'll stumble. I mean we had a stumble last week in operations. We'll have stumbles on the commercial side, but we feel really good about the trajectory that we're on. Oscar Munoz And I would just add, Brandon, and reiterate what I think I said a couple of times publicly. This is a thoughtful approach with lots of team members involved. Andrew Nocella has just joined us, and joined the team and is really in charge of most of that day in and day out. So really thoughtful, but at the same time opportunistic because it is a unique opportunity as Scott outlined that we have and the list of opportunities continues to be a fairly large one, how we do it in a thoughtful balanced way is sort of the course of the day. But I can tell you that market share is not a conversation we have in this room or with our board, it is all about margin. And so, again, I just want to reiterate that point. Brandon Oglenski Okay. Oscar, I appreciate that. But I think you even said it publicly before this is a not a shift in long-term strategy that United is about to grow capacity now at or above GDP. This is, indeed, a shift in the network, is that incorrect? Oscar Munoz I'm sorry?  Scott Kirby Yes, I think that's probably correct. I'm not sure I'd say exactly that. This is not an attempt to go build an empire and go win the market share. It is an attempt to restore United to its natural position. And once there, I would anticipate we will be growing in line with GDP.  Brandon Oglenski All right. Appreciate it. Operator From Bank of America, we have Andrew Didora online. Please go ahead. Andrew Didora Hi good morning everyone. Thank you for question. I guess, Scott, asking the capacity question another way, we can see there's a three to four percentage point pick up in your main line utilization in the back half of the year from June through December. This does put you ahead of where the other legacies are and kind of closer to your big LCC competition. Is there the ability to push this even -- is there the ability to push this even higher or you've kind of maxed out with where you are on the current fleet? Scott Kirby Okay, you're just talking about our utilization? Andrew Didora Yes, main line. Scott Kirby Yes, certainly in the back half of the year, if we wanted to, we could push utilization higher. The utilization is lower in the first and fourth quarters because demand is lower. And so we could push it higher, but -- and not -- to guarantee that we won't change it at all, but it's a much bigger hurdle. It's operationally easy to push it higher, it's financially harder to justify pushing it higher in off peak periods. Andrew Didora Got it. And then just -- haven't had much discussion on Trans-Atlantic, the numbers in 1Q and the 2Q guidance was actually much better than I was expecting given all the -- low-cost competition coming on. What have you -- what are some of the actions you've taken on the Trans-Atlantic to help offset some of this kind of new flying that's coming in? Scott Kirby So, at least for the Star Alliance and so forth, United and flying to the Star Alliance countries, we have not restructured pricing in those markets. And the Sky Team and Oneworld Alliance, pricing has been restructured and lowered. We keep track of the lowest published fares by AP across our whole system, and those aren't always selling fares because yield management bucket sell out at different airlines. But the Sky Team and Oneworld markets fares -- advance purchase fares are down, call it 20% to 30%. They're down about 10% in the Star Alliance markets because there are growth of low-cost carriers and other things that drive those down, but our pricing is much better in those markets than in the other markets. Now, of course, we carry a lot of revenue to those countries, we carry a lot of revenues in the U.K. and to Paris, so we're impacted by that. But we are less impacted by that. Also, at least, in this portion of the year, we're disproportionately selling U.S. point of sale and U.S. point of sale is really strong. I will caution you that as we move to the back half of the summer, the normal demand pattern shifts to European point-of-sale. And so I would expect RASM to be still be high-capacity. RASM to be under more pressure in the back half because once people starts going back to school here in the U.S., the second half of that peak summer season is really much more about Europeans coming to the U.S. and so I'd anticipate in the third quarter a little more weakness just given the European point-of-sale was weak -- was strong. Andrew Didora Great. Thank you. Operator From Morgan Stanley, we have Rajeev Lalwani. Please go ahead. Rajeev Lalwani Scott, a couple of quick questions for you. Just first, on your comments on restoring natural market share. What's the timeline to actually get that? Is that a one, two-year thing, a 10-year thing? How are you envisioning it? Scott Kirby I think we don't know yet, that's for TBD. And I don't think we can --- even if we could do a complete analysis and it just depends on what -- on how the markets evolving and how the new flying and new routes are going to be doing. It's really bottoms up analysis, We're not trying to do a top down and say, here's where we're going to be X years from now, we're doing bottoms up one by one, we're watching the performance of those routes as we up-guage them, or as we add new routes. And it's going to be a judgment that's based on how those things are doing when we get to the point where we're adding flying, and it's not margin accretive, then we'll know probably reach that point. But that's probably going to be the metric where we've decided we've reached that point. Rajeev Lalwani Okay. And post your decision to adjust your capacity for the year, what kind of response have you seen from some of your peers and some of the markets where you're at, or have you not seen any real response? Scott Kirby Look, it's -- we're trying to do it what's right for United Airlines. And because what I think we're doing is really about -- we're not trying to invade someone's market, or do -- we're not trying to create a competitive battle, we are trying to compete that I wouldn't have expected and haven't seen much response. I mean, look, take a market like Newark to Atlanta where 5 years ago, we flew 8 mainline flights or call it 150 seats per flight, and so we had 1,200 seats a day in that market. Delta flew 12 mainlines so you can call it 12x150, so they had 1,800 seats. We were 40% of the market; they were 60% of the market. We shot that down to 6 50-seat regional jets, so were down to 300. And so we were -- and Delta stayed at 1,800 that whole time. And so we were one seventh of the market from 40%. We've now quadrupled our capacity and gone back to 1,200 seats today. And we're back -- right back to where we were before. We're at 40% of the market. I think that's probably the natural share between Newark to Atlanta. Atlanta is a bigger hub with more connectivity and that 40-60 ratio is probably about right. Is it possible that Delta is going to decide to quadruple capacity and go for flying -- in every bank, they're already flying every bank, 12 flights today, are they going to try to fly 48 flights today? I doubt it. That hasn't happened. It wouldn't be rational. So I guess I'd say because of the kind of capacity that we're adding or we're re-upgauging, some of those hub-to-hub markets, and we're adding competitive capacity or adding capacity in places like Chicago to Rochester, Minnesota, we didn't anticipate a respond and we certainly don't think we've seen one. And that's about all we said now. Rajeev Lalwani If I could sneak in one quick one. Scott, you've provided some good color on the Trans-Atlantic market. How are you thinking about Asia? Scott Kirby Well, Asia has been the region under the most pressure because the capacity -- incredibly high growth in capacity. As we get to the second half of this year, we're through the bilateral, particularly to Beijing and Shanghai so capacity growth will moderate in those cities. There are still awful lot of capacity coming from secondary cities. So United is one of the first -- well, the only U.S. airlines -- one of the first airlines to the party and flying to those secondary cities. But it's -- that's going to continue to be a challenge, particularly with the kind of subsidies that people are getting to open up new routes out of China from secondary cities. But the core of China, which is really about Beijing and Shanghai looks like capacity will moderate in the back half of the year. So, we're hopeful that the Pacific PRASM will start to improve in the back half. Rajeev Lalwani Thank you. Operator From Evercore ISI, we have Duane Pfennigwerth. Please go ahead. Duane Pfennigwerth  Hey, thanks. I was hoping to hear from Greg Hart. Is he on the line? GregoryHart Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth  Hey Greg. As you're thinking about this plan to grow domestic capacity, nearly 6% in the June quarter, it would be great to hear from you, your level of involvement in that aggressive plans, what preparations you've made, what lead times look like for staffing and training. And then what gives you confidence that United historically more careful approach to utilization flying is now able to change? Gregory Hart Yes, thanks for the question, Duane. I would say that we've been working on our capability to do this sort of thing for years, and this isn't something we started working on over the past couple of months. We've been focused on developing systems processes, the health of our fleet and lots of other things to make sure that we had the capability to do this. My team has been involved, along with the finance team and Scott's team in every step of the way here and in fact, I feel really comfortable as does the rest of the team that we're going to be able to deliver on what we've committed to and our performance here before would suggest that we've got a great structure in place to allow us to do that. And of course, our employees are really excited about the opportunity to grow the airline again. Duane Pfennigwerth  Okay, I appreciate that comment and that it was years in the making. It's -- it is keen to surprise your finance team for what it's worth when this first started to show up in the schedules. With respect to calibration which, I think, is the most interesting word I heard on this call, United has low relative margins. Those margins are still declining and the company's proposed solution to correcting that is a higher growth rate. So going back to Rajeev's question, how will you measure if that proposed solution is working? And I think investors deserve more than kind of a 4-year goal. What is the timeframe by which you'll measure if it's working that would lead to potential calibration? Scott Kirby Look, we're measuring today and our principal metrics are going to be absolute and relative margin. That doesn't mean quarter-to-quarter because there's going to be fuel price spikes and there's going to be fuel price decline and there's going to be timing of labor deals at our airline or other airlines. But we look at our relative and absolute margins, and we look at it over kind of a trailing 12-month period, and it adjust for things like fuel hedge losses. And those numbers look like we're doing a good job today, and we feel pretty confident. We believe that, that's going to work going forward. I mean, you look at least relative to Delta. In the first quarter, we had higher RASM, better CASM performance, so a lot of other moving pieces in that hedge losses and things that make the numbers a little hard to look at. But that would imply that we're closing the margin gap. Expect we will do so; continue to do so as we move through the rest of the year. And we just -- we feel really good about the path that we're on. We think we are moving towards sustainably closing both the absolute improvement in margins and relative to RASM gap, but that's what we're going to look at and we're not waiting for you to look at that, we're looking at that every day. Oscar Munoz And I would just cap it off with that that is big component of our long-term compensation plan. Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the analyst and investor portion of our call today. We will now take questions from the media. [Operator Instructions] From the Associated Press, we have David Koenig. Please go ahead. David Koenig Yes, good morning. This is for Oscar. I know you're talking about April 30, but I wonder if you could give any more light on what you're thinking about, and specifically are you considering in response to what happened last week on United Express, are you considering simply ending involuntary denied boardings with all the sales policy changes that, that entails. Oscar Munoz Hey David. We are looking at a broad array of issues that affected not only that situation or our broader customer experience. And so we are hard at work at that and have been for the last few days and I'll ask all of you to wait until that time when we talk about it. David Koenig You can't rule that in or out? Oscar Munoz I think I would rather wait until we've done the full work and then we'll report on it next week. Operator From Bloomberg News, we have Michael Sasso. Please go ahead. Michael Sasso Yes. There's certainly was some conjecture that somebody could lose his job over the situation last week. Can you say at the board level or in the management level, was there any of that founded? Was there ever talk of anyone losing their job within management, lower down? Oscar Munoz This is Oscar. Michael, the buck stops here, and I'm sure, there was lots of conjecture about me personally. I think I've met with the board and the board has met independently and we've had fulsome conversations that I'll be involved in some of that work that we're doing, going forward as well as they always have been. I have issued the letter of support, but to your specific question, again, it was a system failure across various areas. So no, there was never a consideration for firing an employee or anyone around it. Operator From THE STREET, we have Ted Reed. Please go ahead. Ted Reed Thank you. Speaking about changes comparisons with Delta. Delta always says they have a revenue premium. This could -- they said 108%. Do you have a revenue premium to the airline industry? Scott Kirby Well, Ted, I hate that metric because if we calculate the numbers here at United, yes, we have a revenue premium and yes, it's higher even than Delta. American also, by the way, when I got there said they had a revenue premium. Because everyone makes all these adjustments to the numbers on stage length and density and a whole bunch of other stuff and so with all the caveats everyone calculates that they have a revenue premium. I think margin is what matters. You can make your revenue premium go up by taking a row of seats off airplanes, for example, and that makes your RASM get higher. You could fly only first class seats on airplanes, and that will make your RASM higher and we give you a revenue premium and have a real cost problem. And so I think looking at margin, we are focused on margin, in closing the margin gap and improving our absolute and relative margin.  Ted Reed All right. I would also like to ask there was this reaction in China to the incident. Have you seen any impact on China bookings because of that incident last week? Scott Kirby We've only had a few days and it's a small numbers problem. There's a lot of volatility in bookings for point-of-sale China, so it's really too early for us to say anything about it. Oscar Munoz And Ted, it's Oscar. I would add that there certainly has been some sentiment and I did visit with the Chinese Consulate here locally to discuss that with them. And I will be heading out there in a couple weeks to have further conversations with customers and related governmental officials. Ted Reed You mean in reaction to this, you're going to make a China trip? Oscar Munoz No, it's been a trip that was planned for some time. There was a lot of other activities going on. It's just a normal travel that I'll do as we run a fairly global airline and we have lots of occasions and employees out there as well as customers. Ted Reed All right. Thank you. Operator And from CNN, we have John (inaudible). Unidentified Analyst Hey good morning. A question about -- you just spoke about corporate customers earlier. How are you seeing an effect at all on leisure customers and in the overall trends in the wake of last week's incident? Scott Kirby Again, it's really too early for us to tell anything about bookings and in particular last week because it was the week before Easter, that's normally a very low booking period, so we just really don't have any quantifiable data. Our forecast for the quarter didn't change at all. We do a weekly forecast that stays to the tenth of a percent exactly the same as it was before, but it's just really hard for us to look at data in the week before Easter and have a good view of whether there was a measurable bookings impact or not? Oscar Munoz And John, I would just add that I've sent out a personal note to a person who is legit, intimate things you can sent to hundreds of thousands of people but to our -- at least at this point, to our most loyal customers and the response rate has been pretty high and positive. Obviously, a lot of people have ideas and thoughts about how we can make things better. But in that particular segment of our highest end customers, there's been a lot of support. Unidentified Analyst And Oscar, in that same vein, I mean, your rival in September 2015 really focused on a creating more employee-focused culture. I'm curious just kind of to go back to the early parts of last week and your comments about emphatically supporting employees. And that statement seems to rile people up more in regards to the characterization around Dr. Dao's behavior. I just want to kind of go back and kind of get inside your head for how you were trying to walk a line between your relations with your employees and your relations with your customer, and if you feel you got that balance right early in the week and how you kind of felt you need to make a pivot later in the week? Oscar Munoz Thanks. Listen, customers have always been first, but I think the evolution of our company, we needed to regain the trust of our employees first before they can do that. And if you think about -- your question about what's in my head and why it was important to support our employees as well as keep customer focus is that customer service at the end of the day, is not about a policy or a procedure or a tool, it's about values, human values, and that we cannot lose because if I lost that with that many thousands -- tens of thousands of employees, we'd be in a very much more difficult situation. So as far as I look at it, it's about values, not protocol. Operator And finally from Flightglobal, we have Edward Russell. Please go ahead. Edward Russell Andrew, I wanted to ask a bit more about the 12 737 that are purchased off lease. I was wondering if you can break down with the variants are 700, 800, 900 and who the lessors were that you purchased this from? Andrew Levy The aircraft were split evenly between 737-700s and 737-800s and the seller was GECAS. Edward Russell Great. Thank you very much. Andrew Levy Thanks. Julie Yates Stewart All right, thanks to all for joining the call today. Please contact Media Relations if you have any further questions and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.

(NASDAQ: URBN ) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call May 16, 2017 05:00 PM ET Executives Oona McCullough - IR Richard Hayne - CEO Frank Conforti - CFO David McCreight - President, CEO of Anthropologie Group Analysts Lorraine Hutchinson - Bank of America Kimberly Greenberger - Morgan Stanley Paul Lejuez - Citi Adrienne Yih - Wolfe Research Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Janet Kloppenburg - JJK Research Marni Shapiro - Retail Tracker Courtney Willson - Cowen and Company Mark Altschwager - Robert Baird Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Urban Outfitters Inc. First Quarter Fiscal 2018 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I'd now like to introduce Oona McCullough, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. McCullough, you may begin. Oona McCullough Good afternoon and welcome to the URBN first quarter fiscal 2018 conference call. Earlier this afternoon, the Company issued a press release outlining the financial and operating results for the three months ending April 30, 2017. The following discussions may include forward-looking statements. Please note that actual results may differ materially from those statements. Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results is contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will begin today's call with Frank Conforti, our Chief Financial Officer, who will provide financial highlights for the quarter. David McCreight, President of URBN, and CEO of the Anthropologie Group will provide an update on Anthropologie group and Richard Hayne, our Chief Executive Officer, will then comment on our broader strategic initiatives. Following that, we will be pleased to address your questions. As usual, the text of today's conference call will be posted to our corporate website at www.urbn.com. I'll now turn the call over to Frank. Frank Conforti Thank you, Oona, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start my prepared commentary discussing our recently completed fiscal year 2018 first quarter results versus the prior comparable quarter. Then I will share some of our thoughts concerning the remainder of fiscal year 2018. Total Company or URBN sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were flat versus the prior year. This sales performance resulted from a strong 14% increase in Free People wholesale sales and an $11 million increase in non-comp sales including the opening of three net new stores in the quarter. The sale gains were offset by a 3% decrease in URBN retail segment comp. Additionally, please note that our sales growth during the quarter was negatively impacted by approximately 100 basis points of foreign currency translation. Free People wholesale segment sales increased 14% for the quarter was driven primarily by domestic growth at department stores and specialty stores. These increases resulted from growth in several categories including women's apparel, intimates and movements. We believe Free People wholesale has the opportunity to continue to grow domestically through their category expansion and internationally within all categories. We're still planning for double-digit Free People wholesale growth for fiscal year 2018. Within our URBN retail segment comp the direct to consumer channel continues to outperform stores posting a double-digits sales increase driven by increases in sessions and conversion rates which more than offset a decrease in average order value. Negative comp store sales resulted from average unit selling price and decreased transactions while units per transaction were up. By brand our retail segment comp rate increased by 2% at Free People while Urban Outfitters declined 3% and Anthropologie declined 4%. Our URBN retail segment comp was the strongest in April which benefitted from the Easter holiday calendar shift while March which was negatively impacted by the Easter holiday shift and February posted negative comps. During the quarter, we opened seven new locations including four Free People stores, one Urban Outfitters store, one Anthropologie and Co. Group store and one Food and Beverage restaurant. During the quarter, we also closed four location including one Free People, Urban Outfitters, and Anthropologie store and one Food and Beverage location. Now moving onto the URBN gross profit for the quarter. Gross profit decreased 8% to $240 million versus the prior comparable quarter. Gross profit rate declined by 284 basis points to 31.5%, the decline in gross profit rate was driven by; First, higher markdowns due to underperforming women’s apparel and accessories product at Anthropologie and Urban Outfitters; Second, deleverage in delivery and logistics expenses primarily due to the penetration of the direct to consumer channel, and lastly deleverage in store occupancy related to negative store comps. Total SG&A expenses for the quarter were up 3.5% to 219 million versus the prior comparable quarter. Total SG&A as a percentage of sales deleveraged by 102 basis points to 28.7%. The growth and deleverage in SG&A primarily related to approximately $6 million of non-recurring expenses incurred in the quarter. These expenses related to severance and fees associated with our store organization project. Without these expenses our SG&A growth rate would have been less than 1% and our deleverage would have been approximately 25 basis points. We estimate the annualized savings related to our store organization projects will be approximately $25 million. We believe we will incur approximately $2 million of additional cost related to this project in the second quarter, but on a net basis we'll begin to see savings related to project in the second quarter and going forward. We believe still believe our store experience including creating unique compelling spaces with great customer service remains an important part of our brands and the relationship with our customers. We believe this project will enable us to maintain these critically important points of differentiation while reducing our expense structure which is necessary due to the decline in traffic to stores. Operating income for the quarter decreased by 58% to $21 million with operating profit margin deleveraging by 386 basis points to 2.8%. Our The non-recurring cost associated with the store organization project noted above negatively impacted operating profit margin by approximately 80 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 44.1% versus to 39.6% in Q1 last year. Similar to last year this increase is primarily due to the ratio of certain foreign losses to global taxable profits in the first quarter. Additionally, contributing to the increased rate is the new accounting standard related to stock compensation accounting. This new guidance reports all tax affects related to share based payments to be recorded through the income statement as discreet adjustments versus additional paid in capital on the balance sheet under the previous rules. This change has no effect on cash taxes paid. Net income for the quarter was $11.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share. The non-recurring cost associated with the store organization project noted above negatively impacted earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.03 per diluted share. Additionally, the higher tax rate in the first quarter negatively impacted earnings per diluted share by an additional $0.02 when compared to 36.5% which is what we believe our annual [technical difficulty] tax rate for fiscal 2018 could be. Turning to the balance sheet, inventory was $359 million which was flat versus the prior year. Retail segment comp inventory decreased by 3.3% at cost. The decrease in a retail segment comp inventory was offset by inventory to stock or non-comp stores. We believe overall inventory is well controlled as it is in line with our retail segment sales comp. By brand, we believe Anthropologie brand is slightly higher than where it should be while both Urban Outfitters and Free People are well controlled. We ended the quarter with $409 million in cash and marketable securities and have zero drawn down on our asset back line of credit facility. Capital expenditures came in at $24 million for the quarter and we are planning for approximately $90 million in total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018. The capital spent for fiscal 2018 is primarily driven by new, relocated and expanded stores followed by investments and direct to consumer related technology. As we entered the second quarter of fiscal year 2018 it may be helpful for you to consider the following. We are planning on opening 19 new stores during the year while closing eight stores due to lease expiration. Urban Outfitters is planning on opening one new store in North America while closing two stores and is planning on opening three new stores in Europe. Anthropologie is planning on opening four new stores, including one expanded format store and closing two stores all in North America. Free People is planning on opening 10 new stores and closing three stores also all in North America. The Food and Beverage division has opened one restaurant adjacent to an expanded format Anthropologie and closed one restaurant adjacent to an Urban Outfitters. Now moving on to gross profit. We believe URBNs gross margin rate for the second quarter could decline in a rate greater than the year-on-year decline in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This decline could be due to increased mark downs and lower initial mark up and women's apparel product at Anthropologie and our benefiters deleverage in delivery and logistic expenses related to the increased penetration of the direct to consumer channel and deleverage in store occupancy related to negative store comp. Based on our current plan we believe SG&A could grow at approximately 2% for the second quarter and 1% for fiscal year 2018. Our planned annual SG&A growth rate primarily relates to marketing and direct to consumer technology investment to continue to support of strong direct to consumer channel sales growth. Finally, as stated earlier our fiscal year 2018 annual effective tax rate is planned to be approximately 36.5%. similar to fiscal year 2017, and as seen in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 we believe our fiscal year 2018 quarterly effected tax rate will be higher in the first half of the year and lower in the second half of the year due to the ratio of certain foreign profits and losses to global tax profit in those periods. As a reminder, the foregoing does not constitute a forecast but is simply a reflection of our current views. The company disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statement. Now it is my pleasure to pass the call over to McCreight president of URBN and CEO of the Anthropologie group. David McCreight Thank you and good evening everyone. As Frank mentioned in Q1 we experienced the negative 4% comparable sales decline versus last year and commenced at margin pressure. Transactions for the quarter were flat, but average order declined as a result of continued challenges in women's apparel which is overshadowing excellence strides made in other areas of the group. Staying finely tuned to our customer has always been an important aspect of our brand. Its this internet awareness that has helped us shape a brand experience and offer that is resonated with many extending through multiple stages of her life. So where did Anthropologie apparel miss the fashion mark and why is it taking so long to correct? Unfortunately, the assortment over the past several quarters do not properly reflect the established archetypes. The star references became less identifiably Anthropologie outside of our unique aesthetic lanes. Additionally, the assortment architecture followed the momentum of her increasingly casual life style, but as a casual assortment built nicely the merchants ever corrected and missed some of the other dresses occasions in her life, appropriate styles for social gathering and work. So we will continue to adopt her more casual attitude, but we'll maintain a better balance across the spectrum of her apparel occasion needs. Am I confident it will be corrected, in a word, yes. We've heard from thousands of customers who have shared their prospective, encouraging us to take the necessary steps to course correct. The apparel archetypes initially outlined are attractive to our customer. We have a team gaining brand experience and hope to see progress this fall. While apparel has faced self inflected challenges here in North America, the UK team has seen notable successes over recent months with double-digit positive comp sales in apparel. The UK assortment reflects a broader range of lifestyle occasions from casual to dresses and continued the unique appeal through quality and special pieces that make Anthro a beloved. Now turning to our category expansion strategies. I'm proud to report to Home continues to realize double digit sales growth over nine sequential quarters, with nearly half of our sales coming through digital and the expectation to reach 75% in coming years. We remain very optimistic about the growth of our home business. Recent research indicated that many of our customers are not yet aware of the impressive breath of the new Home assortment. A small minority of our markets have the ability to see the décor in person. Our website is being modified this summer to improve the home digital shopping experience, our supply chain efforts, our improving costing and reducing the size of future inventory investments. And we've yet to introduce our broader Home offer to the untapped interior designer trade. In fact, Anthropologie home is exploring whole sale opportunities as several national and international department stores have approached us to carry our line. The pending category expansions, lack of assortment awareness my millions of our existing customers and untapped new market potential all suggest that the ultimate revenue target for the Home strategy looks more than achievable. I would like to thanks Andrew and his Home team for there continues progress towards our goal of becoming a leading home destination. Beauty has also continued to deliver impressive growth. Our vision of bringing an artfully curated assortment wrapped in the halo of the distinctive Anthropologie experience has garnered the attention of smaller artisanal brands as well as industry titans. Future of beauty initiatives includes continued expansions and color and skin, securing additional special brands, building our online beauty community and gaining exposure for our own brand lines. I want to take a moment to recognize Kathrin and Beauty team for their innovative approach to curetting an experience tailored to the Anthropologie customer and defying the conventions of an overcrowded industry space. When speaking to growth and evolution I will be remised in not mentioning the Holden and [indiscernible], both have consistently delivered doubled-digit growth with the combined 40% CAGR over the past five years. Success stems from their ability to create captivating experiences and offerings in specialized industries. As with Home and the Holden Anthropologie evolution and distribution expansion will fuel growth in the coming years. For the Holden growth will come from opening more of Holden boutiques in top markets within Anthropologie stores. Further digital evolutions and building on the light [ph] brand following. Terrain's growth will continue with logical category extensions accelerating design by Terrain and the opportunity for Terrain to evolve into the leading component of Anthropologie homes outdoor living offer. As customers divert increasing portions of their time and money on experiences, both brands are nicely positioned being not only purveyors of products, but enablers of activities, special occasions and memory making, the performance to-date of these young brands point to a successful path for unlocking additional value from the Anthropologie Group platform, one with millions of passionate followers. Congratulations to Nicole and Beth and their teams for building their brands and business models. While the assortment takes center stage, the shopping experience, be it in stores or online must deliver too, if not surpass expectations. Consumer retail behavior is fundamentally changing. She is engaging in new ways online and her expectations for store are evolving. Across URBN we're taking a thoughtful approach to the roll each channel placed in our group. In stores, we are catering to the attributes that make in store shopping not only relevant, but often preferred. Our stores are a place to escape, a place to be inspired, and a place to find unique items you can't find anywhere else. This is true both of our core stores and also of our expanded Anthropologie and Co. footprints. Now more than ever we're evaluating investments to ensure our processes and activities are spent on high impact areas for our customers. We surgically reduced the store operating expenses while working to preserve the special customer experience and are investing in complementary omnichannel initiatives. Stores will remain a critical part of our future. Over time the actual number of locations will contract in North America, but the overall square footage may grow. The Anthropologie and Co. format has delighted our core customers, but we're also seeing the benefits of adding new customers while also supporting the sales of retail advantaged categories on the web. Direct sales for home, jewelry, accessories and beauty outperformed the brand in large format markets by up to 25%. We believe the larger format experience will play a significant role for the Anthro brand in the future, but we will remain patient for the real estate market dynamics to adjust to supply and demand pressures. It should come as no surprise that more of our customers are participating through digital channels driving direct to consumer to over one third of total group sales. Stores continue to deliver one of the most unique delightful shopping experiences in the industry and they remain our largest channel. Simultaneously, many of our retail customers are become omnichannel brand participants and new customers are entering the brand through digital. Dick will review the cohesive URBN channel strategy, but I want to share a few specific digital updates for Anthropologie. This year we plan to continue to grow our digital store across categories increasing digital SKUs by 25%. As with our sister brands enhance our digital storytelling by leveraging our customers creativity and passion to inspire each other and in an effort to reduce friction from shopping digitally with Anthro we're introducing a new perk for our loyalty members, a permanent path to free shipping. Clearly there is so much opportunity to build on the nascent success of the Anthropologie Group. I remain confident in our previously stated potential to double the size of the group based on; One, the scale and commitment of a well-heeled customer, who's participation with the brand spans decades. Two, successful early development of complimentary categories. And three, relatively under penetrated markets both domestic and international. As recent stymies [ph] in apparel are resolved, when coupled with the continued progress of these strategic category and brand adjacencies, could herald one of the more compelling periods of growth for Anthropologie in years. I'd like to thanks Dick, Meg, colleagues and the executive team and team members across URBN for their continued support and enthusiasm for the Anthropologie Group. And now I would like to turn the call over to Dick Hayne, CEO of URBN. Richard Hayne Thanks David, and good afternoon folks. This is a difficult period for U.S. fashion apparel retailers. And URBNs first quarter reflect that difficulty. Total retail segment comp sales registered a disappointing 3% decline, well below plan. This drove increased promotional activity and more margin pressure than we had anticipated. As in previous quarters the company saw extreme variability in results by channel. The sales short-fall in Q1 was wholly attributable to weaker than expected store channel performance in North America, where all three brands have encountered sluggish customer traffic and sales. This issue is impacting virtually all U.S. brick and mortar retailers there are simply too many stores and too many malls in North America. We expect to see more closures and brands disappear until a healthier balance is reached. I believe our brand delivered some of the best most creative store experiences in the world. However, it is clear that this experiences currently aren’t enough to overcome the decline in traffic and a tepid interest in apparel and stores. We intend to continue to treat our stores like the important part of the omni shopping experience they are, and equipped them in our associates with the technology they need to please the omni-channel shopper. In the quarter demand for women's apparel in stores was particularly weak. Besides the traffic problem all brands had an assortment issue, execution in the dress category. Each brand planned as dress business down from the very robust spring '16 level. To belief was that in spring '17 some of those sales would migrate to other categories like bottoms or to the newer fashion looks of Onesie and Rockers [ph]. Thus, the brands planned, ordered and therefore sold fewer dresses during the period.  During Q1 sales of bottoms, Onesie and Rockers did indeed trend up nicely, but except for the Free People brand increases in these categories did not offset the losses in dresses. In that respect dresses, we planned lower than they needed to be. Also since the dress assortment carries one of the highest average price points in the women's assortment by ordering and selling fewer dresses each brand's AUR suffered. Further depressing AUR during the quarter was the change in sales mix by product category  Unfortunately, problems with the store channel overshadowed the great progress made in our other two channels. The URBN digital channel progress is evidenced by a strong double-digit increase in sessions which in turn produce double-digit direct sales gains. DTC penetration to total retail segment jump by almost 400 basis points to our highest penetration ever. Even surpassing passing Q4 last year when it typically peaks. Direct was not the only channel to showed strong results. The Wholesale channel producing an outstanding quarter which I'll speak too shortly. Due to the significant disparity in channel results we moved aggressively during the period to bring our cost structure more in line with sales. This resulted in changes of each brand's store structure with the elimination of some redundant positions and new job assignments throughout the store hierarchy. Keeping North American stores expenses under control as traffic falls is a challenge and will likely require cooperation from our land lords. Fortunately, in the past 24 months they seem to be more willing to partner with us. The digital theme has also been restructured moving from three separate groups each serving a single brand with little cross brand coordination to a centralized configuration, where resources are better priorities and aligned. New rolls were added during the period to help in the areas of personalization, mobile and omnichannel intergradations. Digital improvements in the first quarter including the successful rollout of our new strike platform to the Urban Outfitters brand globally including the launch of our IOS and Android apps in Europe. With this implementation, all major brands now share a common platform. The new platform has better user speed and navigation and has resulted in double digit basis point improvements in bounce rates and conversion. It along with the new digital structure should enable URBN to leverage digital investments across all brands and make improvements to our sites at a greatly accelerated pace. Other enhancement to side functionality and convenience scheduled for implementation this year include full inventory availability by store, pickup in store, greater site personalization, search and browse improvements, custom order furniture capabilities, improved customer communication and better service levels like faster, less expenses and more reliable delivery options. Now I'll discuss first quarter brand highlights beginning with Urban Outfitters. U.S. quarter was in line with the total company. Global retail segment comp sales fell by 3%, women's apparel in North America underperformed against our expectations mainly due to the issues I discussed previously that is poor store traffic and sales, lower dress sales and lower AUR. But in Europe the women's category significantly overperformed with strong comp sales in both store and direct channels. Curiously a considerable amount of the women's product is common to both geographies, which might support the notion that one of the biggest problems based in U.S. retailer is too much supply and too many stores. Despite the top line short fall the brand exited the first quarter in a clean inventory position. Total comp inventory decreased by 3% versus the prior year period and product freshness improved with the percent of each product over 90 days following by approximately 800 basis points. This improvement reflects the progress the team has made in adopting a faster speed to market discipline meant to have quicker inventory turnover and allowed new product to reach the customer faster. The Urban brand continues to see good growth in it's direct channel were all categories except women's accessories recording solid regular price year-over-year sales increases. Sessions this year versus the same period last year advance by mid-teens and this was accomplished before the benefit of new platform, which was installed in mid-April. Increased traffic is being driven impart by social media. UO Instagram followers now stand at 7 million, a 43% increase over the same time last year and the brand was mentioned almost 0.5 million times on Instagram in the first quarter, a sequential increase from Q4 of 129%. Moving to the Anthropologie Group. I believe David covered much of the quarter performance information in his commentary so I won't repeat it. What I do want to reinforce is how much opportunity I believe resides in this brand. We continue to execute the strategy outlined three years ago at our Vision 2020 conference. That is how we realized the customers were migrating to digital. The only things we miss judge was the velocity of that migration. Much of our work was aimed and increasing our capabilities, influence and categories beyond apparel. The expanded category constant was primarily designed to help drive our direct business and secondarily to diversify away from reliance on women's apparel, it turns out our strategy was [indiscernible]. Once the women's apparel assortment is improved and I believe we are making progress toward that goal, the Anthropologie Group will be well positioned to be one of the dominant lifestyle brands, serving their chosen demographic across multiple categories. I now turn your attention to the Free People brand, first let me say that I believe that the Free People apparel offering is currently among the best and freshest in all retail. In Q1 online customers enthusiastically embraced the fashion and drove full price apparel comp increases. But once again sluggish comp store sales diminished that success, so total retail segment comp sales grew by only 2%. Relative to the other URBN brands, Free People benefits from having the highest penetration of direct sales to its retail segments sales. This is encouraging because we believe the other brands we evolve to this higher DTC penetration as well. The Free People wholesale business posted impressive revenue growth in the first quarter with year-over-year sales up 14%. Increases came from gaining in the core apparel offering and all customer groups including domestic and international accounts and department specialty and digital stores. Expansion categories accounted for 25% of wholesale revenues in Q1, the brand theme believes this percentage will grow as new categories like [indiscernible] gained wider recognition and acceptance. To that end marketing efforts in the quarter includes mailing and FD moment catalog to 390,000 customers and opening a small moment pop-up shop in New York City. The Free People team learned from past problems and exercise outstanding inventory control in Q1. As of April, total brands comp inventories this year stood 21% below last year, while the brand delivered a 10% increase in total sales. In addition, the brand realized a several 100 basis points improvement in merchandize margins in the quarter. Except for comp sales in the store channel, the Free People team delivered an outstanding quarter. That's a short look at URBN's first quarter results. Now let me turn your attention to our vision for the future. Short term I believe the trend established in Q1 will likely persist into Q2 with some upside potential in the Free People brand. Second quarter to-date store traffic and sales at all brands continued to be challenged. Since it's unclear if or when this trend will change. It's important for URBN to focus and invest in other areas of opportunity. Currently we are experiencing success in four major business areas and these four are where we see the most opportunity for future growth. So, first is digital. Digital is URBN's biggest opportunity and our primary focus. We intend to accelerate the growth of our digital reach, by this I mean we will large our audience, add followers, expand our social media presence and at the same time build our content including adding products, product categories, brands, and services along with more compelling images, video and more user generated content. We'll also continue to invest in better user experiences. This requires continual improvements to our sites and apps, greater ability to know the customer and tailor their experiences based on that knowledge, and better service levels regarding delivery. We believe the total digital sales could double within five years. The second is international, on-American sales currently account for less than 10% of total URBN sales. Given the power of our brands and their recent strong performance in Europe we believe we have substantial opportunity to extend their reach and increase the international sales penetration. To that end last year we created a new position, Global Head of International, and hired an executive with many years of international expansion experience. He has made significant progress in identifying and negotiating more than a half dozen new European store bases [ph] as well as franchise arrangements in multiple Mid-Eastern and other countries. We plan to open three new stores in Europe this year and ramp up that pace over the next several years. Besides opening more stores we'll continue to focus our international expansion efforts using our digital and wholesale channels as well. The third is wholesale, one of the primary strengths of our brand teams is their ability to create compelling products and experiences, in other words to create content. Free People has grown its wholesale revenues at a double-digit pace for five consecutive years. This has been accomplished through a combination of enlarging the brand's reach geographically and expanding the product categories offered. And while Free People is our model this content creation capability exists within each of our brands. We believe we can better leverage and monetize our talent by offering more of our content through the wholesale channel. In addition, we've new and expanded categories that have amazing opportunities for wider distribution. These range from Free People movement to Anthropologie Home. Overall I would like to see our wholesale revenues double within five years. The fourth is our smaller brands. We have spent almost a decade incubating our two brands Holden and Train [ph]. While both brands remain relatively small they are growing the fastest. Both benefitted from becoming part of the Anthropologie Group and both have an opportunity to serve a much larger audience. I believe the Holden [ph] revenues could exceed a $100 million and Terrain could exceed $50 million both within the next three to five years. So in conclusion the URBN brands are powerful and still possess significant untapped opportunities for growth. The four areas of opportunities I just discussed, if properly implemented could add many hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to our top line. This at a time when many North American retailers are desperately searching for growth vehicles because the traditional method opening more stores is no longer viable. We believe our brands have significant and exciting alternatives and we intend to exploit them. To achieve this growth we intend to invest for the long-term. We won't be arbitrary, we will plan and we will test and learn. But our bias will be towards growth and achieving scale. We have amazing opportunities to expand and extra ordinarily creative talent within the company to accomplish it. I'm quite confident we will succeed. That concludes my prepared remarks. In closing I want to thank our brand and creative leaders as well as our shared service team. I also thank and salute our 24,000 associates worldwide for their hard work, dedication and amazing creativity. Finally, I thank our shareholders for their continued advice and support. I will now turn the call over to your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open. Lorraine Hutchinson The overall inventory looked to be in good shape, I was a little surprised to see Anthropologie over bought. Can you talk a little bit about the ageing there and what your plans had been for turnaround? And then just lastly how you are thinking about inventory buyers for the upcoming quarters for that brand? Frank Conforti Yes, Lorraine. This is Frank. Ageing at Anthropologie as well as all three of our brands right now is considerably more current than it was on the year-over-year basis. So from an ageing perspective we do look good across all of our brands. I will tell you that I think Anthropologie is a little heavier than we would like it to be heading into the second quarter, and that does pose a little bit of markdown risk for them into the second quarter as well. I would tell you going forward, our methodology has not change that we anticipate inventory being in line with sales within a 100 basis points or so for each of our brands and for URBN going forward. So total inventory was flat, which was in line with our sales and total retail segment, comp inventories was a minus 3, which was also in line with our sales for the quarter and I'd anticipated those ranges being consistent going forward of the ratio of inventory to sales. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kimberly Greenberger My question is on ecommerce, Dick I think you said there was over a 400 basis points increase in sales penetration online. Were you speaking about total URBN on that? And does it vary greatly by brand? And then I wanted to just ask on the Anthropologie, I think David when he was talking, he mentioned a past two consistently get free shipping, it sounds like that's through the Anthrocordor [ph] loyalty program launch. Could you just talk a little bit more about what that program will involve? And if there is an expected loss of shipping revenue that would accompany the implementation of that program that would be really helpful. Richard Hayne Okay Kimberly, I'll take the first part of it. I said almost 400 basis points, it's in the 300 and it rounded up. So I took my license to say almost 400. But it was impressive gain in terms of penetration. So it is reasonably similar across the Urban and Anthropologie brands. So we do believe that it will continue into the second quarter as well. So David you want to talk about it Anthropologie? David McCreight Kimberly, yes your interpretation is correct. So what we have done is listened to our customer and watched, as Dick mentioned the priority around digital was to reduce friction in the shopping experience and so for -- after our test and studies what we will be launching next week will be for Anthro members and those who aren’t members, encouraging them to sign up. Free shipping for purchases of over $150 and that will be every day around the clock, that will reduce shipping income. but we expect that will have a net -- that will be more than offset by the gains in demand and net sales, in customer engagement. And candidly making the customers happy as well. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Paul Lejuez with Citi. Your line is open. Paul Lejuez Dick, you mentioned digital sales you said could double in five years, I am curious what do you think could happen store sales and what happens to EBIT margins under this five year plan over the past several years as your e-comp penetration has increased, [indiscernible] gone down, I am just wondering when you expect that to change? Richard Hayne I am not going to talk about EBIT, what I will talk about is the models that we do create. We have plugged in a negative single digit comp for stores for the next five years. Now we certainly hope that we can beat that, but this was sort of a what if scenario and we also planned our direct to consumer sales up, sort of inline, double-digit with the way we have been performing over the past number of years. And when you add all that up we are not disappointed with what the results were. So we also think there is a lot of opportunities as we go forward with the stores almost similar between 10% and 12% of our store leases come up to renewal on an annual basis now for the next five years. And we are beginning the sale lot more movement on the part of landlords to help us on the occupancy rate side. And we believe it will continue to have that and my guess is it will probably accelerate. So I am very hopeful about it. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Adrienne Yih with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Adrienne Yih My question is also on the e-com penetration, you said it had reached the highest ever, I think last quarter you said high 30 or somewhere in that range, when you could update that and whether it was markedly different by UO and Anthro brands, I know its significantly higher Free People. And then David, your comment that you just made about leases coming due and potentially getting better rent deals, does some of these moment and some of things that are happening and you embedded a negative comp for store level comp, did it actually make you reconsider your square footage foot print not necessary the unit box foot print, but the square footage itself? Thank you so much. Richard Hayne Let me take the first of that Adrienne, I'll let Frank take -- I'll take the second part and let Frank take the first. Fortunately, for us as you know we have now over expanded or in my mind over expanded, we were one of the more conservative folks in terms of opening our store fleets across all of our brands. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of the store fleet. I do believe that the landlords are getting much more realistic about rents and the incredible uptake that we had, sort of over the last 10 to 15 years is certainly going away, we don’t see much upward pressure, but there is considerable down ward pressure. So it does depend on the individual lease, where they are and so the secondary locations we're seeing tremendous moment. The primarily locations we're starting to see movement and that would good and that allows us to contain and control our occupancies. Frank Conforti Hey its Frank, for URBN to total retail segment our penetration is now north of 35%, by brand that’s relatively consisting for over Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie, Free People is always been a different ratio as there to our base and square footage is small relative to their total retail segment. They are closure to a 50-50 split with actually DTC is being slightly higher than stores right now.  Operator Your next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Lindsay Drucker Mann  I wanted to dig a little bit more, Frank into the gross margin commentary you had. First, I guess my question is why for Q2 is the expectation for gross margins to be down more year-over-year versus 1Q, given where inventories are and what's the driver of the reduction in IMU, the outlook for reduction IMU for the second quarter. Frank Conforti Yes Lindsay, this is Frank, so the drivers for the second quarter are the same drivers in the first quarter, so marked down as IMU, delivering logistics deleverage as well as store occupancy deleverage. Your question about what different from Q1 to Q2 is, we believe that there is rate for a higher rate of mark down and a lower IMU in the second quarter in order to clear through the underperforming women's apparel product right now that’s in the spring and summer selling season in order to say clean and transition into the new season being for fall and winter. So that’s where the changes from quarter-to-quarter, the pressure on IMU is more about the mix of products seen in the women's apparel being underperforming right now, it affects our overall IMU as women's apparel is one of our highest IMU classes so that's more about next -- from a product category perspective then anything. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research. Your line is open. Janet Kloppenburg Dick, I just wondered about the international opportunity, do you see that equally weighted to digital, and brick and mortar, and maybe if you could give us an idea of what your overall square footage growth rate would look like as you accelerate the international -- I assume as you accelerate international store opening, just some thoughts there would be helpful. And Frank, I was wondering is there anything you can do to reduce the pressure of the delivery and logistical pressure on the gross margin line, is there any efficiencies being built in there or scale that perhaps could alleviate that pressure or at least modify it? Richard Hayne I don't think -- I definitely think that will expand international through all three of our channel [ph]. Take wholesale to begin with, Free People is making very good strides particularly in Europe to increase their business there. As David mentioned we have a number of people who are asking us about other product categories and from our other brands, we currently sell to [indiscernible] some of the home product and we've opportunities at other places as well. So, wouldn't dismiss wholesale I think that's going to be an important part. Of course, we've digital opportunity. Over the last two years we've now gotten through our platform what we're calling our A15 [ph] site platform and it is now up with all three of our brands and that allows us much better flexibility to do the things that we need to do to grow the international DTC business as well as our domestic ones. So, I think that digital has a lot of opportunities. Certainly stores, as I said we're going to do three additional stores -- we have not been expanding more recently, but now we're going to expand the stores. And if you look at the number of stores that we have in Europe which is well under a 100 across all brands, and then you look at the number of stores we have in the U.S. and you consider the fact that European sales and the kinds of categories that we sell are approximately equivalent in Europe as they are the U.S. I think it starts to tell you that there's opportunity for us to expand this store fleets for all the brands in Europe and that then not to mention some of the licensing and franchise agreements that we may enter into in places that are a little less friendly for us to open stores. So, all in all I think there's lots of opportunity internationally. I still rank digital across the entire world as our number one opportunity to grow our business. Frank Conforti Janet just to answer your question around delivery and logistics, if you were to look at just strictly our direct to consumer channel, delivery and logistics actually is -- has begun to leverage and we're starting to see some of the improvements there from the new facility that we put in and the teams and some of the processes that we have there. The deleverage that you're seeing is related to the increased penetration from the direct to consumer channel itself. That's why -- as that increases our overall mix, it's going to have an impact there on those two line items. Where the opportunity lies is for the DTC to offset some of that, that increase penetration to offset some of the occupancy expense as a rate and start to leverage out on store occupancy. We didn’t realize that opportunity in the first quarter based on where our store comps were, if store comps were to improve you would actually start to see some improvement and leverage in store occupancy offsetting the deleverage that you get in delivery and logistics from the increased penetration and direct to consumer channel. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Tunick with Royal Bank of Canada. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst This is Kate on for Brian. I guess when we were just thinking about the brand margins and opportunities to recover from here just giving what you are seeing in stores, and then also keeping in mind some of distributing initiatives going on at Anthro. Realistically, how should we think about Urban margins recovering from the 9% we saw in 2016 and Anthro the 11%, we saw in 2016 as well, overtime where do you see the opportunities on these brands just kind of considering this new retail reality with the store traffic et cetera? Frank Conforti I think as it relates to each of the brands as we are going through this channel shift between DTC and stores. I hesitate to give a forecast as to where our brand margins could be on a go forward basis versus historical, and I think as you have seen with all of retailers supporting the demand of -- the consumer demand with two distinct and then overlapping channel has become a more expensive preposition, so I think getting back to historical will be challenging, but to give a specific forecast by brand right now I don’t think we have enough clarity to do so. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro with Retail Tracker. Your line is open. Marni Shapiro So I guess as you open stores a little bit more aggressively across Europe, and as you think about the stores here in the U.S. most particularly in Europe would you look to that bigger experiential ancillary model with more of the flagship and lien on the digital or would you look for smaller stores? I'm curious with your thinking is there. David McCreight  Our conversations internationally have been varied by market, we want to make sure given the dynamics of the space and the cost that we represent the brands well as we enter new markets and as Dick said, we believe the wonderful synergy is creating that brand awareness so we want to have initial launches that are full representations of the brand. But then really maximize it digitally and then we are in discussions with our potential franchise partners on how they view square footage in their markets as well. Operator Your next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible]. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst  Frank, are you seeing any -- positive EBIT margins from the growth of wholesale, like what's the right way to think about what that's been doing or what that might be able to do for the remainder of the year and then beyond as [indiscernible] sales continue to grow? Thanks. Frank Conforti As wholesale continues with their strong growth, we were very pleased with the plus 14% for the first quarter with healthy margins their great execution amongst the Free People team and we are still believing that the Free People wholesale can deliver 10% top line growth for the remainder of the year. There is a benefit to our overall margin, what I would say is, exactly where that shakes out will all depend on where retail segment comp comes in and you know we're not in position right now to give a forecast for the remainder of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Courtney Willson This is Courtney Willson on for Oliver tonight. Thanks for taking our question. Just diving a little deeper into the markdowns that occurred during 1Q, could you give a bit more detail just on which classification or categories within apparel saw by highest levels in markdown and then also which has the highest full price selling. And then within the dress category at Anthro, the dresses that you did have, were they sold mostly at full price or did you take markdowns there as well? Frank Conforti Yes, Courtney this is frank again. We don’t give that level of detail within our product categories as how we just performing to specifics related to rack price and markdowns. Richard Hayne Courtney this is Dick, what I can tell you as we take markdowns in every category and that is because as merchants we always make mistakes and the markdowns are a way to clear those mistakes. So if we aren’t taking any markdowns in a category it's because we are not awake because we do make mistakes all the time. Operator Your last question comes from Mark Altschwager with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Mark Altschwager So when you think about doubling the wholesale exposure over the next I think you said five years how you are thinking about the various channels their department stores versus specialty and what role does Amazon and maybe other peer play ecommerce platforms play within that strategy? Richard Hayne The e-com plays a very significant role and that’s the e-com people that we sell to are doing quite well and as a percent are the fastest growing. Now some of those e-com players also happened to be either specialty stores or department stores. So it's hard to categorized one against another. You specifically mentioned Amazon, we do not sell Amazon, none of our brands sell on Amazon and we don’t anticipate any of our brands selling to Amazon. So you can take that one off the list. But we do believe that it will be a mix mostly of department stores and in Europe department and specialty stores and across all geographies it will be direct. Richard Hayne Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America. Your line is open. Lorraine Hutchinson The overall inventory looked to be in good shape, I was a little surprised to see Anthropologie over bought. Can you talk a little bit about the ageing there and what your plans had been for turnaround? And then just lastly how you are thinking about inventory buyers for the upcoming quarters for that brand? Frank Conforti Yes, Lorraine. This is Frank. Ageing at Anthropologie as well as all three of our brands right now is considerably more current than it was on the year-over-year basis. So from an ageing perspective we do look good across all of our brands. I will tell you that I think Anthropologie is a little heavier than we would like it to be heading into the second quarter, and that does pose a little bit of markdown risk for them into the second quarter as well. I would tell you going forward, our methodology has not change that we anticipate inventory being in line with sales within a 100 basis points or so for each of our brands and for URBN going forward. So total inventory was flat, which was in line with our sales and total retail segment, comp inventories was a minus 3, which was also in line with our sales for the quarter and I'd anticipated those ranges being consistent going forward of the ratio of inventory to sales. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kimberly Greenberger My question is on ecommerce, Dick I think you said there was over a 400 basis points increase in sales penetration online. Were you speaking about total URBN on that? And does it vary greatly by brand? And then I wanted to just ask on the Anthropologie, I think David when he was talking, he mentioned a past two consistently get free shipping, it sounds like that's through the Anthrocordor [ph] loyalty program launch. Could you just talk a little bit more about what that program will involve? And if there is an expected loss of shipping revenue that would accompany the implementation of that program that would be really helpful. Richard Hayne Okay Kimberly, I'll take the first part of it. I said almost 400 basis points, it's in the 300 and it rounded up. So I took my license to say almost 400. But it was impressive gain in terms of penetration. So it is reasonably similar across the Urban and Anthropologie brands. So we do believe that it will continue into the second quarter as well. So David you want to talk about it Anthropologie? David McCreight Kimberly, yes your interpretation is correct. So what we have done is listened to our customer and watched, as Dick mentioned the priority around digital was to reduce friction in the shopping experience and so for -- after our test and studies what we will be launching next week will be for Anthro members and those who aren’t members, encouraging them to sign up.

(NASDAQ: VIAB ) Q2 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call May 04, 2017, 08:30 AM ET Executives James Bombassei - SVP, IR Robert Bakish - President and Chief Executive Officer Wade Davis - Chief Financial Officer Cyma Zarghami - President, Nickelodeon Group Analysts Ben Swinburne - Morgan Stanley Richard Greenfield - BTIG, LLC Alexia Quadrani - JPMorgan Doug Mitchelson - UBS John Janedis - Jefferies Michael Nathanson - MoffettNathanson Jessica Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Viacom First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Teleconference. Today\'s call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Bombassei. Please go ahead, sir. James Bombassei Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to join us for our March quarter earnings call. Joining me for today\'s discussion are Bob Bakish, our President and CEO; Wade Davis, our Chief Financial Officer; and Cyma Zarghami, our President of the Nickelodeon Group. Please note that in addition to our press release, we have slides and trending schedules containing supplemental information available on our website. I want to refer you to Page number 2 in the web presentation and remind you that certain statements made on this call are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in our filings with the SEC. Today\'s remarks will focus on adjusted results. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on the call can be found in our earnings release or on our website. And now I\'ll turn the call over to Bob. Robert Bakish Thanks, Jim, and thanks to everyone, for joining us today. I\'m happy to report Viacom delivered a solid fiscal second quarter, one in which we continued to show improvement, growing revenue in both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. On the Media Networks side, increases in affiliate revenue, along with continued international strength, drove top line growth. On Filmed Entertainment, Paramount increased revenues across all of its business units. At the total Viacom level, revenues were up 8%, and we grew adjusted operating income 4% in the quarter. Reported operating income was down 43%, driven by $280 million in restructuring and programming charges incurred as we realign and invest to fuel our new strategy. Wade will speak to all the numbers more a little later. But first, I\'d like to take you through what I see as the headlines of the quarters beyond the financials. These come in four broad buckets: strategy, organization, our balance sheet and general execution, which is our increasing focus. First, on strategy. On our last call, back in February, we laid out a comprehensive strategy for turning around Viacom. To put the full power of Viacom behind our flagship brand, to elevate our approach to content and talent, to focus on partnerships, to grow our brands beyond linear, both in digital and off-media; and to continue to strengthen our organization. In the past few months, my team and I have spent considerable time sharing this new strategy with all of our key constituents, from our distribution, advertising and creative partners, to our employees and to you, our investors. And I\'m happy to say that, throughout these conversations, the strategy was well received. Second, organization. In the last quarter, we\'ve made important progress on our enabling organization with the new senior leadership team now fully in place. The biggest news here is leadership at Paramount. As most of you know, we\'ve hired Jim Gianopulos to run the studio. Jim is a smart, seasoned executive with the operating expertise to help the studio address its strategic challenges of the last several years and the strong creative relationships to help jump-start its pipeline. Since early April, I\'ve been working closely with Jim, and he is working closely with the senior team at Paramount to chart a new course for the studio. He is also working with leadership in our Media Networks to help map out long-term plans for co-branded films. More broadly and across the company, we continue to take significant steps to ensure that our structure aligns with our strategy. We\'re breaking down the silos that have impeded broader collaboration across the company in the past. For example, we recently announced Kern Schireson as Viacom\'s first Chief Data Officer and made moves to unify our research and audience science teams to further strengthen our data, media analytics and consumer insights across the company. We also announced the creation of a new global product development group to more effectively develop and launch authenticated multiplatform products across our portfolio, principally to support the pay-TV viewing experience. That group will also ensure that we\'re bringing some of our international success stories, including our Play Plex mobile apps to the domestic marketplace. Third, balance sheet. As I\'ve said before, we remain committed to maintaining Viacom\'s investment-grade rating. To this end, we recently took significant steps toward strengthening our balance sheet, improving our leverage profile and enhancing liquidity. This included consummating a $1.3 billion hybrid debt deal, the proceeds of which were used to redeem $1.4 billion of our near-term maturities; and the April announcement of the sale of our 49.8% stake in EPIX to MGM for $634 million, which we anticipate to close shortly and whose proceeds will be used to retire further debt obligations. And we moved forward with our slate financing agreement with our partners in China, which Wade will speak to later. Combined, these moves will strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and give us greater flexibility as we move forward. Fourth, execution. Increasingly, this is what it\'s all about, executing. Let me share with you a few highlights from the quarter. First, MTV. Chris McCarthy and his team have been very busy behind the scenes. And I\'m pleased to say that they\'re approaching the completion of their first phase of work, putting in place a new team, strengthening the schedules and introducing a new programming pipeline with renewed focus on unscripted content. This has already created some value. What I\'m most excited about is the second phase of work, bringing the team\'s hard work to the screens, to audiences. Starting this month and rolling out throughout the summer, this includes new content, new talent and return of daily live programming to the network. The first show to hit this month, a revamped and broadened MTV Movie and TV Awards airs Sunday, then a week later comes the new Promposal which is just what it sounds like, young people making pretty amazing proposals to take their intended dates to the prom. A new version of My Super Sweet 16 accompanies it. Then a reimagined Fear Factor, hosted by Ludacris, follows two weeks later and all of this is just the beginning. There are eight new shows in the month. As part of this, we\'ve also initiated a major expansion of our Times Square studio, best known as the TRL Studio, to power this drive into live. This will fuel a live afternoon programming block that will provide a critical on-ramp to MTV\'s primetime block. And by next fiscal year, the network expects to program nearly 50% more content powers. Additionally, it\'s pushing quickly into live experiences, including a free three-hour preshow festival for audiences to amplify the Movie and TV Awards this weekend. Second, Paramount TV production, a real and untold success story. It launched in 2014 with the goal to create and deliver cinematic filmmaker-driven SVOD and premium cable content. Today, the studio has far exceeded its initial target of two dramas and one comedy on air in three years. They currently have the critically acclaimed series 13 Reasons Why now streaming on Netflix. It\'s already the most tweeted-about show of 2017. They have renewals in the form of second seasons currently shooting on Berlin Station and Shooter and a third season of School of Rock with Nickelodeon and season three and four of the Bajillion Dollar Propertie$ on Seeso. And they are currently in production on the best-selling novel The Alienist for TNT and Tom Clancy\'s Jack Ryan, starring John Krasinski, for Amazon. This summer they begin shooting Maniac with Cary Fukunaga, Emma Stone and Jonah Hill and in the fall, The Haunting with Steven Spielberg\'s Amblin TV for Netflix. Paramount TV already has strong relationships with the top creators and producers on and off screen and has been recognized for its work with 10 nominations and 5 Emmy Awards with the breakthrough hit for Grease: Live. Having a successful TV production business attached to the studio provides helpful consistency in cash flows, and I believe it is fundamental to the success of the studio. And let\'s not forget that this is a low capital-intensive business. We see considerable value here going forward. Third, ad sales. Right now, we are several weeks into upfront conversations with our marketing partners. And I, along with our flagship brand leaders, sales and data executives have been meeting with agencies and clients to unveil new brand strategies and content and to discuss new ways of working together. Along the way, we\'ve regularly heard from marketers about the need for consistency in audience targeting and measurement for advanced TV advertising. That\'s why we\'re so excited to unveil Open AP with our partners at Fox and Turner in March, creating the industry\'s first open platform for cross-publisher audience targeting and independent measurement, which builds on the success we\'ve had with Vantage, our data-driven advanced audience platform. We believe Open AP represents a considerable opportunity for programmers, agencies and advertisers and we\'re pleased to say that, from early positive feedback, they agree. While it\'s early days, I\'m optimistic about this year\'s upfront and believe that both television and Viacom are well positioned. More on that next quarter. Fourth, distribution. Here, we continue to move beyond one-note conversations on carriage to comprehensive discussions on how we can build more value for all parties while sustainably supporting and evolving the pay-TV ecosystem and we are not waiting until renewals to engage. In fact, we are currently actively engaged with a number of parties all outside the traditional renewal discussions. Here, there are two things worth mentioning. First, we now have data and advertising pilots operational with two major U.S. MVPDs, whereby we are inserting some advanced advertising campaigns in their local commercial availabilities. Second, we are speaking with several MVPDs regarding variations on the entertainment skinny pack concept, and we\'re optimistic that one could launch by the end of this year. Both of these are early but tangible examples of the implementation of the strategy we first rolled out to you on our last call. And whether it\'s marketers, distributors or other industry partners, a lot of this simply comes down to being more engaged, more accessible and more transparent. We\'ve been and will continue to be very active on this front as we feel there\'s enormous potential to create new opportunities. Fifth, international. I\'m pleased to report that our business outside the U.S. continues to thrive. We are seeing continued strength in audience delivery across the pay portfolio with revenue-weighted share up 4% in the quarter. We also extended the reach of our pay brands in the Middle East with the launch of three new channels, including Paramount. At the local level, our latest acquisition, Telefe, continued its dominance as Argentina\'s monthly ratings leader in every day part this quarter, contributing to our advertising and affiliate growth abroad. And Channel 5 experienced its fifth straight quarter of growth and increased its audience share in key demographics by 4% year-over-year. Finally, last month, we announced the acquisition of a controlling interest in Porta dos Fundos in Brazil. We\'re really excited about this one. The company is a leading short-form comedy content producer creating digital native content for Brazil\'s number 2 YouTube channel. These are all important moves as we continue to position international as an even bigger contributor to our overall business. Lastly, Nickelodeon. Under Cyma Zarghami\'s leadership, Nick has already built a strong foundation for what we\'re trying to achieve with all of our flagship brands. It\'s fully global, fully diversified across consumer products, experiences, theatrical and digital, while consistently dominant on linear. With that, I\'ll hand it over to Cyma, President of the Nickelodeon Group, to share more insights into Nick\'s progress and priorities moving forward. Cyma? Cyma Zarghami Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob said, Nickelodeon is on very solid ground. This success is the result of several strategic steps that propelled us to number 1 with kids, a position that we\'ve held for three years and counting. And we continue to extend our lead over the competition with year-over-year ratings growth of 5% this quarter. Nick has the top kid shows in every genre, thanks to a new generation of shows that kids love, with new hits like The Loud House and more new episodes from SpongeBob, live-action favorites like Henry Danger and a new set of popular preschool programs including PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines, providing diversification across our portfolio. At any given time, we have a strong bench of six to eight shows that power the lion\'s share of our GRPs, which account for 65% of all ad-based kid viewing in the marketplace. It was the strength and diversity of our pipeline that earned the network\'s top-rated status and ownership of the top 10 shows with kids 2 to 11, kids 6 to 11 and kids 2 to 5. So here\'s a little bit more about how we got here. First, based on findings from an in-depth research study that we conducted, we acknowledged and addressed three key developments in the landscape. A new generation of kids who are very different from those who came before them, even more new platforms and devices like smart TVs, streaming players and more tablets and an altogether different paradigm in entertainment, one that puts a premium on more new content and on-demand viewing. So with that as a backdrop, we\'ve rolled out the results of our audience research study to the entire organization. We installed new leadership in every creative group. We cultivated a new roster of Nick talent that reflects the audience. They\'re smart, relatable and diverse. We redesigned our New York facilities and expanded our West Coast offices in Burbank to ensure that our teams have the best environment to support their creativity. Burbank is the home to our animation production. We have 20 shows currently in production there and more than 600 incredibly talented in-house animators and creators. We committed to building franchises from the ground up, which includes making consumer products a part of the development process. We reimagined a marketing approach for our content and brand that is multiplatform and immersive. It\'s 360 degrees, 365 days a year. And most importantly, we significantly increased our content pipeline. To meet the audiences\' demand for more, we created a pipeline for every genre: live-action, animation, preschool, TV movies, live events and new formats like digital and short form. For this current season, we have almost 700 episodes of new and returning series with a mix of programming coming from multiple initiatives that allow us to generate more content with only modest increases in production budgets, like co-productions with our international divisions and experiments with new formats. This content delivers results across platforms and geographies. The Loud House is reaching SpongeBob-sized ratings in the U.S.A. And in less than a year, globally it\'s already top 10 in 10 countries. We continue to prioritize growing our owned and operated platforms. For the fiscal year-to-date, we saw 31% increase in full episode streams. Preschool was even stronger, where our episode streams grew 105%. And our preschool content, in particular, is helping power our strong consumer products portfolio. We have more than doubled the number of properties in our preschool portfolio, which helps us generate $4 billion in annual sales at retail. PAW Patrol is the number 1 preschool property. It was the number 1 show for kids 2 to 5 this quarter. It was named licensing toy of the year by the Toy Association, and it remains both a hit on TV and in consumer products internationally. Shimmer and Shine is a top 5 preschool show here in the United States, and it\'s already a top 10 property in 10 countries. And we\'re also laying the groundwork for the launch next year of an all-new animated series for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The new series is a true reinvention and will energize the fan base across television, games and apps and consumer products. Because our strategy is paying off, we feel confident in our performance, and we\'re now looking to make the Nick brand even bigger and beyond television. Very quickly, here\'s three initiatives that align with the overall Viacom strategy to move our brands more meaningfully into film, the physical world and the digital world. We\'re working closely with Paramount to develop IP for the silver screen and for small screen. There will definitely be another SpongeBob movie. We\'re developing big-screen treatments for Henry Danger and the Loud House, with more to come. But the first example of this new collaborative way of working is Amusement Park, an animated film in theaters next summer first and then followed by a TV series. Amusement Park is a great example of the kind of movies that should be Nickelodeon. In the physical world, there\'s an opportunity with families to take vacations together. So we\'ve launched a luxury resort in the Dominican Republic last year, and we have another one coming next year in Mexico. And our goal is to have a series of these license deals in the coming years. Live tours are an important part of our franchise planning. The model right now is a PAW Patrol live tour, which has been selling out here and internationally. We\'re moving towards multiple tours up and running simultaneously. Digital is another opportunity. Games are a successful extension of our franchises. We have more than 50 apps so far from seven different properties, and more than half of these have hit number 1 at launch. We recently announced the creation of our entertainment lab. It\'s a technology incubator for experimenting with VR, AR and AI in new, faster ways to develop and create and produce IP. So as Nickelodeon keeps moving forward and growing, we\'ll continue to be laser-focused on cementing our position in the hearts and minds of the next generation of kids and families. We have a clear and growing leadership position in television and a clear path to significantly expand the brand with many, many initiatives already underway. Thank you, and now I\'ll turn it over to Wade. Wade Davis Thanks, Cyma, and good morning. We\'re pleased to report our financial results for the March quarter of fiscal 2017. In the quarter, we again saw revenue growth at both Media Networks and Filmed Entertainment. We continue to execute on our strategic plan, and we took steps to strengthen our balance sheet and de-lever the company. Before I take you through our adjusted operating results, I want to note that we took $280 million of restructuring and programming charges in the quarter. These actions are aligned with our new strategic plan, including our move away from scripted product on certain networks, the rebranding of Spike as the Paramount Network and the streamlining and consolidation of certain Media Networks support functions. While some of the savings from these actions will fall to the bottom line, the majority of the savings will be reinvested to fund the execution of our strategic plan. Now let\'s take a look at our operating results. In terms of consolidated results, we saw growth across a number of key metrics in the quarter. Viacom generated revenue of $3.3 billion, an 8% increase over the prior year. And adjusted operating income of $612 million, which was up 4%. We generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.79, an increase of 4% over the prior year. And year-to-date, we\'ve generated $343 million of operating free cash flow, which is up 49% over last year. Our top line growth was driven by strong performance across all Filmed Entertainment revenue streams, increases in affiliate revenue and continued strength at our international Media Networks. Slide 4 of our web deck provides the financial overview of our Media Networks segment. Revenues for the quarter increased by 1% to $2.4 billion. Revenues included a 1 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign exchange. Worldwide affiliate revenues increased 2%, while advertising revenues declined 1% and ancillary revenues were flat. Adjusted operating income declined to $747 million. Slide 5 of our web deck provides a breakdown of our Media Networks\' domestic and international revenue performance. Domestic revenues decreased 2% to $1.9 billion, and we had another strong quarter at our international operations as revenues increased by 11% to $478 million. On an organic basis, if we exclude a 7 percentage point unfavorable foreign currency impact and 10 percentage point positive impact from the Telefe acquisition, international revenue grew 8%. At our domestic Media Networks business, we continue to see growth in affiliate with revenues up 1% in the quarter. The growth reflects rate increases, partially offset by a modest decline in pay-TV subscribers as well as the decline in revenues from SVOD agreements. Domestic advertising declined 4% in the quarter, consistent with our guidance from the last earnings call. The performance in the quarter reflects the timing of the Easter holiday, which had an unfavourable impact of 100 basis points. Excluding this impact, domestic ad sales performance was in line with the December quarter. Strong pricing increases were more than offset by lower impressions. International advertising revenues increased 11% in the quarter. Organically, if we exclude an 11 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign currency and a 17 percentage point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe, international advertising revenues grew 5%, reflecting continued strength in Europe. International affiliate revenues increased 10%, which included a 4 percentage point unfavourable impact from foreign currency and a 4 percentage point positive impact from the acquisition of Telefe. The growth in the quarter reflects the impact of rate increases, subscriber growth and new channel launches as well as higher revenues from SVOD and OTT agreements. Internationally, ancillary revenues were up 11% due primarily to growth in consumer products, driven by the strength of our kids brands, including PAW Patrol and Blaze and the Monster Machines as well as growth in TV licensing. Currency has had an immaterial impact on ancillary revenues. Worldwide expenses increased 5% in the quarter and reflect an unfavourable 3 percentage point impact from the acquisition of Telefe and a favourable 1 percentage point impact from foreign exchange. Excluding these items, organic growth in worldwide expenses was 3%. Within operating expenses, programming expense was flat due to the timing of programming premieres aired in the quarter. SG&A expense increased 11% in the quarter due to higher advertising and promotion cost and the acquisition of Telefe. Distribution and other expenses increased 9%, which included the impact of Telefe. Overall, we continue to be pleased with the progress we\'re making at Media Networks. We\'re moving quickly to implement our flagship brand strategy, and we expect to see the benefits of this strategy and a strengthened portfolio as we progress through the year. Turning to Paramount. The slate financing agreement that we entered into last December remains on track and is in operation. Additionally, the partners have elected to upsize their commitment from 25% to 30%. As previously announced, this is a three-year agreement with an option to extend to a fourth and covers films beginning with our fiscal 2017 slate. Now turning to the studio\'s results for the quarter. Filmed Entertainment revenues increased 37%, driven by gains across all revenue streams. Slide 6 of the earnings presentation provides the breakdown of the Filmed Entertainment revenues. Theatrical revenues increased 10% to $238 million, primarily due to the release of xXx: Return of Xander Cage, partially offset by lower carryover revenues. Home entertainment revenues increased 29% to $198 million, primarily reflecting the number and mix of current quarter releases, including Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, Arrival, Allied and Fences. Licensing revenues increased 45% to $347 million, primarily driven by Paramount Television productions, including 13 Reasons Why and Shooter as well as higher revenues from pay-TV and SVOD distributors. Ancillary revenues increased 149% to $112 million, primarily driven by the impact of the film slate financing in the quarter. Filmed Entertainment generated an adjusted operating loss of $66 million in the quarter as compared to a loss of $136 million in the prior year, an improvement of $70 million. The improvement reflects the gains in revenue, partially offset by higher print and advertising expenses related to our fiscal 2017 theatrical releases. In terms of taxes, the year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 30.5% as compared to 32.8% in the prior year, driven by the mix of domestic and international income. Slide 11 of the earnings presentation provides the components of free cash flow. Year-to-date, we generated $343 million of operating free cash flow, which is a 49% improvement versus last year. The increase in free cash flow versus the prior year was principally due to lower working capital utilization, reflecting lower film spend. Looking at our debt on Slide 10. It remains principally fixed rate with an average cost at quarter-end at 4.8%. We had $12.2 billion of total debt and $671 million of cash and cash equivalents at quarter-end. During the quarter, we continued to take steps to strengthen our balance sheet, improve our liquidity and de-lever the company. In February, we issued a total of $1.3 billion of hybrid securities, which received partial equity credit from the ratings agencies. In March, we used those proceeds to redeem $1.4 billion of our near-term maturities. If you take into consideration the equity credit we received on hybrid securities, our adjusted gross debt at quarter-end was $11.5 billion. In April, we announced the sale of our 49.8% stake in EPIX to MGM for $634 million, inclusive of dividends. We anticipate that the transaction will close this quarter, and we\'ll use the net after-tax proceeds of approximately $570 million to redeem outstanding debt. Pro forma to the sale of EPIX, our adjusted gross debt at March 31 would have been $11 billion. Since we announced our strategic plan on February 9 and our commitment to delevering, if you take the EPIX sale into account, we reduced gross debt by $1.3 billion or approximately 10%. We continue to be focused on strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our capital structure to support our long-term strategic objective. And we are focused on preserving our investment-grade rating by monetizing non-core assets enhancing our cash flow as well as taking other actions that will allow us to achieve our stated objectives. Now let\'s turn to some of the factors impacting the second half of fiscal 2017. For the June quarter, we expect continued improvement in worldwide ad sales driven by ongoing double-digit growth in international, offset by declines in domestic advertising in the low single digits, reflecting sequential improvement from the March quarter. As for affiliate revenues in the June quarter, we expect that both domestic and international revenue will continue to grow with worldwide revenues showing sequential improvement from the March quarter. For the full year, we expect that the growth rate for Media Networks programming spend will be in mid-single digits, including factoring in the impact of the acquisition of Telefe. Fences will modestly benefit from our restructuring actions. For the full year, on an organic basis, we expect Media Networks SG&A expense growth rate will be in the mid-single digits. However, including the acquisition of Telefe, recorded SG&A expense will grow in the high single digits. In terms of taxes, for 2017, we forecast a book tax rate of approximately 31%. We\'ll continue to prime this as we go through the year and get a better sense for the domestic versus international profitability mix. With that, I\'d like to turn it back to Bob to wrap it up. Robert Bakish Thank you, Wade. In closing, we will continue to move fast, be aggressive and be opportunistic in driving the turnaround for Viacom. Our goal is to evolve Viacom into the premier portfolio of global multiplatform entertainment brand. As we stay focused and flexible and become a partner of choice in our industry, we know that goal is well within our grasp. And as we do, we\'ll remain focused on growing earnings, free cash flow and delivering value for our shareholders. I know we spent time with many of you over the past few months, and we will continue to do so moving forward to ensure the dialogue continues. Thank you for all your support. We will now take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go first to Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Thanks, good morning. Bob, obviously, there\'s a lot of concern in the marketplace about the state of the bundle. And I\'m wondering if you could talk about the improvement you\'re expecting in affiliate revenues in the U.S. in particular, your relationships with some of the key MVPDs, particularly Charter, where, I believe, there\'s been some potential re-tiering. And then for you and/or Cyma, just on Nickelodeon. It was interesting. Hulu obviously is not carrying the network. Not a surprise. But they called out Nick\'s content on demand as a key part of their SVOD offers. Obviously, they see value there. How are you thinking about managing Nick\'s content distribution given the changing landscape? And are there opportunities, you think, for real revenue benefits on that business in the medium term from some of these shifts, maybe touching on your strategy for SVOD with Nick, in general? Thanks. Robert Bakish Thanks, Ben. A bunch of questions there. But look, there\'s a lot going on in the industry, for sure. There was recently some data on subs that probably were seeing some softness, too. It is worth noting that, that subscribing data is differentiated by distributor. Some operators actually grew subs while others declined. So while early, it does suggest there\'s some execution differences going on. But I think that\'s also - should be a rallying cry for the industry. We need to work together to ensure that the product and marketing better support industry performance. We\'re already engaging in that dialogue with really all of our partners and believe that this will probably be a catalyst for escalating those dialogues. And that, at the end of the day, is a good thing. We also think, among other things, it highlights the need for truly new consumer options. And we do think that this entertainment pack initiative fits perfectly as a low-priced entry point for some of the people that are not currently participating in the ecosystem and may have churn due to price points. So a lot going on there. With respect to Charter, in particular, we are aware of the issue. Worth noting, it appears to affect new subs only. It\'s not a broad re-tiering. I read something today that suggested it might be. But suffice it to say, this is in the context of an ongoing integration there. There is a difference of opinion on what\'s appropriate. We have a very strong point of view and are in conversations about it and I believe this will get resolved. And again, at a macro level, we continue to be focused on partnership with Charter and where there\'s other conversations going on and other MVPDs and are working to build and evolve the pay-TV ecosystem. On the Nickelodeon front, let me just touch on SVOD in general and then I\'ll let Cyma add some color to it. So again, we are principally focused on maintaining the value of the pay-TV ecosystem. It\'s why I made the decision earlier this year not to renew a set of properties with Hulu. That was something they were very interested in, to be clear. And I haven\'t seen Mike\'s commentary on that, but it doesn\'t surprise me because they do continue to have some product. We have to make sure, as an industry, that we are not creating inexpensive alternatives for consumers to access our best product. And so that has very much driven our current thinking on SVOD. Clearly, within that framework, there is an opportunity to put some product in SVOD, whether it\'s U.S. or international. In international, there\'s also the dimension of country and different markets or in different places with respect to pay-TV penetration and the like. But there are some things that make sense out there. So you can expect we would have some presence, at least on some platforms, but not in a high-volume, fresh kind of way. Cyma, you might want to add to that. Cyma Zarghami Sure. The product that we have on Hulu right now is primarily a set of our hits that have many seasons and many episodes. And we have our own - we have a deep library of content that fuels our own channels, six of our own platforms. But as we build out our consumer products business and capabilities, it is beneficial to our hits to have them in multiple places and multiple access to the consumers. And when they work, they work almost everywhere. And performance on television is not affected at all by that performance on Hulu. Ben Swinburne Thank you both. Wade Davis Operator, we’ll take our next question. Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go next to Rich Greenfield of BTIG. Richard Greenfield Hi, thanks for taking the question. Sort of a followup to the last one, the MVPDs, broadly, the facilities-based ones, they\'ve struggled to create kind of more flexible bundles. They\'ve got all of these legacy minimum distribution clauses that makes it hard to create bundles without broadcasters or without sports. But from what we can tell, it looks like they have a lot more flexibility. They want to create so-called virtual MVPDs or over-the-top bundles where they could actually launch bundles that don\'t have some of the legacy sports and broadcast channels. When you talk, Bob, about kind of new skinny bundles, are these the type of things - I mean, we sense Charter has been working on one of these kind of sports-less bundles. Rutledge has been pretty outspoken about the need for lower-cost bundles. AT&T\'s Stephenson\'s done the same. Just curious, like, is that the type of thing that you think could happen from existing distributors over the course of this year? Robert Bakish Yes. Thanks, Rich. So we\'re not privy to everyone\'s contracts on a specific level, clearly. But your general characterization, we would agree with. We do believe there are opportunities to create these skinnier bundles. And we\'re in very deep conversation with one particular entity right now about exactly that. And we do believe that, as we get a breakthrough here that will be a catalyst for more. Because look, at the end of the day, when you talk to people running these distribution companies, and I have met with the CEO of every one of them, everyone acknowledges that there\'s a marketplace opportunity here. And that\'s certainly based on their own data, which we haven\'t seen. It\'s based on international data where things exist. No one questions the opportunity. And again, I think, given what\'s going on in some of the - with the recent universe figures, it increases the need to provide alternative packaging options to consumers to bring them into the ecosystem. So yeah, I think there is a path where someone will create a structure that allows this to come to market, again, that\'s something we\'re working on. By the way, that probably or potentially includes the fact that broadcast signals are accessible via antennas and that offering is integrated in. So there are things going on here. There\'s a little bit of complexity, but we continue to be in a lot of conversations. And I\'m quite confident that we\'re going to get somewhere. Richard Greenfield Thanks very much. Operator We\'ll go next to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Alexia Quadrani Thank you. Could you provide a bit more color on what you\'re currently seeing in the domestic ad market, how pricing is trending? And I know you mentioned we should expect some sequential improvement in the June quarter. Is that excluding the Easter - the benefit of the Easter shift? And then just a followup on the Paramount TV Studio. When you see such success as you have with 13 Reasons Why, I guess, could you just give us some color about how that may sort of maybe have an indirect benefit to the studio and your efforts there to put you more on the map? I guess, any color on that would be great. Robert Bakish Sure. So again, a bunch of questions there. Nice to hear from you, Alexia. On the ad market, look, we\'re feeling good about it. And as I indicated, we\'ve been -- and I\'ve personally been in a lot of conversations with the people running all the major agencies as part of a new approach to the upfront we\'re initiating this year, where instead of doing a single, very large presentation where we kind of broadcast information to 1,000 people, we\'ve been sitting down in a much more intimate, kind of agency-to-agency, in some cases, client-specific setting, where it\'s not only sales folks, myself, it\'s our flagship brand presidents and talking to them about what\'s going on. So we have a fair amount of read on the market. I\'d say, I\'m - we\'re definitely feeling good about it. There is, in terms of scatter market, some typical free upfront posturing. And I say this having been the Chief Operating Officer of domestic advertising sales in the kind of the first part of the 2000s. So this is not at all uncommon. I would say, big picture, the market is good. Supply is tight. I mean, that\'s the benefit of some of the other things that are going on. There is noise on digital, without question. And TV is well positioned. So I think the market is pretty good, and it\'s setting up nicely for the upfront. As far as the comps for the June quarter and your question about Easter, Easter is worth about a point to us. It was a -- so if you look at the March quarter and the June quarter, it did -- when we have the minus 4 in the June quarter, it is equivalent to minus 3 when you adjust for Easter. So if that\'s your question, that\'s the answer. As far as Paramount goes, they\'re - as I said in my formal remarks, there\'s a lot of great stuff going on at Paramount on the television production side. It really is a great time to be in the television production business. There is a lot of demand. And kind of one of the unique things that we have is, at Paramount, we have a deep library of stories that we\'re drawing on, some of them only relate to films that have been brought to market, some of them aren\'t. And we\'re really - it\'s early days, but we are having some great success in converting that into episodic television in a very financially attractive way to us. So I feel good about 13 Reasons. Why? It\'s clearly - like I said, it\'s the most tweeted-about show in 2017. There\'s a lot of discussion on it. Wait, it is a tough topic, and there\'s also discussions in school. I also want to point out that it is a TV mature-rated product. It\'s not for young children. But it\'s created a lot of interest. And it\'s probably something that has the potential to continue. Again, we haven\'t announced anything on that. But does that answer your question? Or you have anything else specifically on television production? Alexia Quadrani No, that\'s very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go to Doug Mitchelson of UBS. Doug Mitchelson Thanks, so much. Bob, you\'ve already started to talk about shifts in your relationships with distributors and strategies with distributors. There\'s still a lot of concern for Viacom on affiliate revenue growth and the cadence. And you\'ve talked about providing more flexibility to distributors, and a lot of investors think that means less distribution for some of your networks, which means less affiliate revenue, less ad revenue. Can you square that up? Is giving distributors more flexibility the equivalent of less affiliate revenue for Viacom? Robert Bakish So we\'ve talked about not flexibility, per se, but broadening the partnership discussion. And what we mean by that specifically is, historically, our discussions were almost exclusively at renewal points and almost exclusively about - and really they were exclusively about carriage of linear fees and how much on-demand product was going to go along with that. Today, and again, we\'re in arranged conversations with very large MVPDs, kind of as we speak, the conversation is happening when there isn\'t a deal up, point one. Point two is, it is including other topics that can provide value from Viacom to distributors. I mentioned in my remarks about these two data pilots we have going on where we\'re literally inserting Vantage campaigns in local avails and having MSOs benefit financially from that. Now clearly, that\'s early days, but I\'m actually very happy to have two of those up and running already. So that\'s good news. As far as carriage of networks goes, you can think of our networks come in 3 flat - 3 tiers, if you will. You have the flagships, which we talked about. You have another set of broadly distributed networks, MTV, VH1 and TV Land, which all have up ratings in the last quarter. They\'re doing very well. All have strong consumer franchises. And then you have a set of, what we call, digital or suite services. The conversations that we had on that last category, historically was all about we want more distribution, more distribution. And really, that causes problems because they want services in tiers, et cetera. So we moved off that conversation. We\'re fine having those up there for hierarchy clients. Our principal focus is ensuring ongoing broad distribution of - in our flagships and this other widely distributed tier. And we\'re missing that carriage in some places, and we\'re in conversations about hopefully getting that back. But it\'s not about a notion of being totally flexible per se to carry anything you want. It is very much also about what Rich was talking about before, which is finding the catalyst for the entry point for this entertainment pack, because if you think about it, pay-TV has gotten very expensive. You\'re talking $100-plus ARPUs in a world where people have to pay for cellphones and the like and there\'s a lot of stress on that machine. We fundamentally believe that a lower-price option will be pretty compelling to people. And again, so there\'s a lot of conversation about that. Now clearly, that doesn\'t involve all of our services. It would involve the suite services, at least at the most basic, widely distributed tier, maybe as an option for other tiers. But the principal opportunity is on widely distributed service. And if you think about the Viacom brand in this, remember, we have the #1 preschool brand in the world with Nick Jr. Full Stop, the only kids channel Nickelodeon. Full stop. If MTV, which has had its bumps in the road, but I\'m telling you, and I would encourage you to ask an advertising agency that have been in our upfront dinners, there\'s a lot of excitement coming, whether it\'s Promposal, [indiscernible] or the return of TRL, this thing is going somewhere. And by the way, it\'s going somewhere in a not just linear way, all of these properties have, let\'s just call it, deep integration with non-television devices. In fact, the Promposal, we sourced hundreds of thousands of ideas off the Internet very quickly. So it\'s an integrated strategy. On the Comedy Central, the biggest problem with Comedy Central ratings in the last 18 months has been the transition of our late-night franchise. John and Steve have gone away. Trevor is starting to hit his stride, and we got Jordan coming in the fall with a half hour. That\'s really - that should be the new going-forward block. Jordan\'s been in a lot of our effort. He has been in lot of our upfront dinners. He\'s really funny. We have high hopes for that. So Comedy, I believe, it\'s already highly valued. It\'s the only brand of its kind in media. And it\'s on a path to continued improvement. And then you got BET far and away, number 1 in the African-American demographic. It has the biggest share in the market. We just did a series of upfront presentations there focusing on what they have coming up in some - in their late-night blocks, the comedy stuff, et cetera, it looks very strong. And finally, Paramount. That\'s a big story for us. So you think of just those six services, that\'s preschool to adults, including film, that\'s a killer block and a killer cornerstone at a really, potentially very attractive price point. So look, we got - we\'re working hard to work with our partners to evolve this business, but we fundamentally see opportunity here. And we\'re very focused on unlocking it. Doug Mitchelson Thanks, so much, Bob. Robert Bakish So there\'s one other thing that I would say, just because in the context of Viacom, and I know there\'s a lot of noise on this distribution point and I get it. But really you should focus on the broad range of opportunity that we\'re going at our company. There is distribution to recapture, and that\'s valuable to us. There is viewing share to grow, and we have a clear path to that. There is upside in domestic advertising. And that\'s on - based on growing our viewing share, that\'s based on pricing opportunity, particularly in the Spike to Paramount transition. That\'s based on growing our yield by continuing down the data-driven advertising path, something we\'re continuing to drive the industry on. There is international, additional international opportunity, and you see we have nice momentum there and there\'s no question that Paramount will turn. And as we\'re doing that, we\'re building a very nice television production business to go with it, which is key to having a valuable, sustainable studio. And then finally, there\'s real greenfield opportunities in digital where we have very small share, and there\'s obviously a lot of time spent viewing. And beyond media, what Cyma talked about, what we\'re doing in the hotel space, now Comedy Central, MTV are doing experiential stuff. Nickelodeon is coming next year with experiential stuff. There\'s a lot of opportunity there. So there\'s no question there\'s growth for Viacom as we navigate this changing world. Doug Mitchelson I appreciate all the color Bob. Operator We\'ll take our next question from John Janedis of Jefferies. John Janedis Thank you. Cyma, could you talk more about how advertisers are thinking about reaching the kids in the younger demo? Is it a shift away from the TV screen? How does the toy money look broadly in? And will the original hours at Nick need to increase annually going forward, given the competition?  Cyma Zarghami Sure. We have a bunch of categories that are consistent across our business, right? Obviously, toys, obviously the movie studios and the market looks good at the moment. So we\'re very optimistic with our share being up and the large sort of percentage of the share that we have in the ad market at the moment. And I think that the advantage to Nickelodeon and all of the ecosystem that we have built is that we are able to reach kids with mass simultaneous viewing opportunities that you really can\'t get anywhere else. And I think that is really one of our advantages. That, and the fact that we have an incredible stable -- an incredibly stable position at the moment and a clear path to some consistency with some real hits in the market. So we\'re feeling very optimistic about our position and the growth of our ecosystem, particularly on the Nick app and the Nick Jr. app. Robert Bakish Yes. And I\'d just add to that, really, kind of echo it. If you look at Nickelodeon, where it\'s come over the last couple of years, you could argue, two, three years ago, it was the SpongeBob network. And Cyma and her team took that as a serious challenge a couple of years ago and built this multi-genre, multi-demographic pipeline that you\'re seeing coming to fruition today, and among other things, delivering 10 of the top 10 shows on kids television and having those new franchises working today. And the top 3, by the way, aren\'t SpongeBob. It depends on which demographic you look at and you can get deeper than that. So that\'s something that you can\'t build overnight. And as we\'ve been seeing the benefit of that, our share lead versus our traditional competitors of Disney and Cartoon has actually grown. And so that\'s momentum that I\'m highly confident will continue going forward. And when you talk about advertising, you talk about supply and demand, right? So the supply is tight, and we have a larger share than we\'re used to. That\'s a great place to be going into a selling cycle. And the demand is strong, too, because you\'ve got a couple of key categories, and Cyma referenced them, toys, films and QSR, among others, that are also in good shape. So you put that together, that feels pretty good in the context of Nickelodeon in this upfront and having a really sustainable position in the marketplace. Wade Davis Last thing I\'d add with respect to that kid\'s ad market is that the characteristics around digital and the restrictions around digital for the kid\'s ad markets reduce the number of alternatives that are available for advertisers who want to reach children. And so it just further creates a dynamic in which Nickelodeon is must-buy for anybody who wants to reach kids. Robert Bakish By the way, the other thing I would say on Nick, which I think is interesting, and it goes probably to an underlying question you have in terms of, "Do you have to produce more stuff?" In the last two years, the other thing that\'s happened is, Nickelodeon has moved to sourcing ideas globally, not just from the U.S. And in fact, as proven, that you can have hits that come from outside the U.S. And that\'s very important because, a, it gets you a wider footprint of creative ideas. And b, the economics of those ideas are substantially superior to U.S.-produced ideas. So you are getting very high quality at a more attractive price point, which, on a total mix basis, helps manage your spending as you -- in this time, we\'ve ramped episode. And again, we\'re in a very unique position of being able to that given our assets. John Janedis That\'s helpful, thanks. And may be if I can sneak one in for Wade. Thanks for the update on the China slate financing. As you know, there\'s been a lot of noise and headlines around the payment. So is the takeaway that given the upsize commitment, that the funding concerns shouldn\'t be an issue and that payment is on track? And does the 30% mean that there\'s upside to the initial $1 billion? Wade Davis Yes. So despite everything that\'s written, we\'ve never really had concerns about payment. There is a payment schedule in the agreement, and we\'re going to receive cash this quarter per the schedule that was always in the agreement. And in terms of upside, yes, there is upside too from the 25% to the 30%, given that, as I said in my remarks, the deal in the aggregate still pertains to all films released in 2017. And so to the extent that there\'s 30%, that\'s upsized from what we\'ve been incorporating into our financial statements to date. John Janedis Thank you. Operator We\'ll go next to Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Wade. Bob, now that you have time to take some cost actions, review programming schedules, look at the global footprint of the company, can you share expectations for cost growth over, let\'s say, the midterm, between programming and non-programming cost? And what\'s the right way to think about those two buckets? Robert Bakish Yeah. Look, we\'ve done a lot of work over the past six months or so, including a restructuring. We\'re not giving guidance at this point on specific elements of the P&L. What Wade said about the restructuring is worth echoing, which is, yes, there are savings in the restructuring. And some of those savings will drop to the bottom line, but they\'re also really a funding mechanism as we continue to strengthen our company and that\'s both with respect to programming, but more specifically, with respect to expanding into places where we don\'t have significant participation today. So we talked about setting up the digital business unit, which we\'re currently working on and building out some offerings there. So this is about - and I think a lot of this is story of Viacom, it\'s we\'re remixing. When you looked at - if you look at the brands - for the domestic brands, the pay-TV business, you\'re seeing our expense base getting remixed within brands. So the context of MTV, where we\'re shifting our mix to be much more back towards unscripted, back to mix change that has economic implications that allows the production of more hours at same price point, for example, we\'re shifting the mix of spending across brands. So an example of that would be shifting spending to the Paramount Network as we re-brand Spike and do that in January and March. And we\'ve started with advertisers about - talking about programming that\'s coming. It represents a substantial investment on a single network basis, but it\'s being funded as a remix. So that\'s how you should really be thinking about it. I don\'t know, Wade, if you want to add anything to that. Wade Davis Yeah, it\'s really - I mean, it\'s funding investments in future growth, right? I mean, when we rolled out our strategy, we did get a lot of questions specifically around digital and live events as to whether or not people should think of us needing to invest significant new dollars in executing against those initiatives and the answer is no. We are taking efficiencies that we\'ve been able to extract from other parts of the organization and have been able to reinvest the majority of those savings into initiatives that are going to generate growth in the future. Michael Nathanson Okay. And then Wade, can you just follow up on the slate financial question? So far, first half of the year, you\'ve seen the benefit at the studio and the ancillary line. Does that continue for the rest of the year or it - was that a first half kind of catch-up due to the slate financing? Wade Davis There will continue to be impact in fiscal \'17. And depending on how we elect to structure certain elements of the forward slates, there may be -- there may or may not be impact in the forward years. Michael Nathanson Okay. Thank you. Wade Davis Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator We\'ll go to Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jessica Reif Cohen Thanks. I have two questions. First, I just wanted to go back to the advertising topic. Given the ramp-up in programming, particularly over the summer, can you talk about how you\'re approaching the upfront market, which takes place before a lot of its original programming takes place? And over what period of time do you expect the new consortium, the Open AP, to really have a significant impact? And on a completely different topic, on the film group, should we expect more restructuring charges as Jim Gianopulos comes in and brings in his own team? And is there anything, in your view, that he can do to fix the existing slate while his develops over the next, say, 18 to 24 months? If he develops his own slate, what can he do with the existing slate? Robert Bakish Sure. Thanks, Jessica. So in terms of the programming path and how that fits with the upfront, we have very much been talking about, as you\'d expect we would, I just think it\'s more significant given what\'s going on, about our going forward programming with all the agencies- we did a studio tour, as an example, to all the studios, showcasing the new MTV, showcasing the Paramount Network. So yes, that is very much part of our upfront process and will be part of our upfront transaction. For example, we\'re in conversations with advertisers about unique opportunities to participate potentially in creative ways on the relaunch or the rebrand to the Paramount Network. And there\'s some interest there. Absolutely, that\'s part of the dialogue. And certainly, we see this clear path to MTV ratings improvement. That\'s going to be part of the economics, if you will. In the context of Open AP, actually, I\'ll flip that to Wade because he\'s deeply involved in it and will probably give you the more precise answer. Wade Davis Yes. But I think your specific question is the timing of the impact -- timing and significance of the impact of Open AP. So as you probably know, that Open AP is not yet available. It won\'t be available until the beginning of the broadcast year. And over the course -- between now and then, we\'re going to continue to build participation in that. The enrolment period is open through the end of June. I guess, as of the beginning of next week, we will have met with every major network. And based on those meetings, we expect to significantly expand participation in the initiative. In terms of the impact that we - the magnitude of the impact that we expect it to have, even though it\'s not currently available, in the upfront, we\'re seeing Open AP as a significant factor driving interest and scale around audience-based buying. And I think, probably, it\'s important to point out that this is something - Open AP is something that we\'ve done in response to advertiser demand. Advertisers were asking for alignment of process and measurement to enable them to be able to take advantage of some of the advances around next-generation TV advertising, and in particular, audience-based buying. So the fact that we\'re seeing very strong interest materialize in the upfront ahead of any availability from an advertisers\' standpoint, which is kind of the actual expression of their early interest that generated the initiative, and the fact that we\'re seeing strong interest from other networks in participating in the initiative, all cause us to continue to be very optimistic about what Open AP is going to enable for us and the rest of the industry. Robert Bakish And then moving to Paramount, Jim, here\'s a couple of things. One is it goes to the execution point. There\'s a lot of things you have to do once you have a film so you got to distribute it. You got to market it. You have to drive ancillary value, other window values, sales, et cetera. So there\'s a bunch of stuff that he will certainly - and is already working on improving execution that will create value and then on the films themselves, they\'re not all made yet. So even though you have a slate and you have films in production, you do screenings, you fine-tune them. And he will certainly participate in that process. So I think we will feel - I know we will feel Jim\'s impact. I already have. And by the way, the employees on the lot also feel and they\'re very excited about it. So you\'ll see that value begin to feather in. Wade Davis I would just add, more specifically, in terms of what impact we expect to see Jim to deliver on the 2018 slate. I mean, I\'ve been extraordinarily impressed on how fast he\'s hit the ground running and how he\'s really rallied the existing team and brought in select new talent. We brought in a very senior person in television licensing. But as said, you asked the question about, "Is he going to bring in his own new team on a wholesale basis?" And one of the things I\'ve been most impressed is how he has come in and immediately improved and refined certain processes that needed to be improved. But almost most importantly, he\'s really jump-started the culture there and engaged the existing team in ways that are really impressive to see. And in terms of how that\'s likely to manifest itself, if your question about his ability to impact the \'18 slate, I mean, obviously, some of the films have been made, but not all of them. As it relates to the films that have been made, he\'s been very, very specific and targeted around things that he can do to improve the expected performance of those films by looking at refining the release strategy. I think, based on some of the things that he\'s focused on, there\'s significant upside in the marketing and releasing costs in certain of those films. And it\'s also really important to remember that Jim\'s roots are in international. And as the international market becomes more important overall, that that\'s something that Jim is bringing increased focus and perspectives on. So all those things are examples of things that we expect to have a positive impact on \'18 despite the fact that, as you point out, many, but not all, of the films have been made. Robert Bakish Yes. And the other thing, and maybe this is obvious, but he\'s really in it. He\'s not letting this thing fly on autopilot. He\'s in all facets of it, and he brings deep expertise and knowledge to the table across many, many areas. So we\'re very optimistic about the studio under Jim\'s leadership. Jessica Reif Cohen Right. And then just one - that was an amazing outlook, really great answer. I mean very - that\'s a lot of color. But the last question, should we expect any more restructuring charges from Film in the next quarter? Wade Davis There may be some additional restructuring charges, but they\'ll be very modest. So a lot of times when people see a new studio has come in, they\'re afraid, to your first question, that they\'re going to disrupt the team and the operational continuity, but also that they\'re just going to kind of flush a bunch of the product that they didn\'t have their name on. And Jim doesn\'t bring kind of a lot of ego to that question. He\'s very objective in looking at the product that he thinks is going to work and how to optimize that product from an economic point of view. So either that\'s translated into kind of a very practical and targeted approach that is not - we don\'t anticipate anything significant. There may be - really, to the extent that there\'s any write-offs, they\'re largely going to be on projects that are in kind of a earlier, mid-stage development that Jim doesn\'t see the kind of potential for to actually make in the movies.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go first to Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Thanks, good morning. Bob, obviously, there\'s a lot of concern in the marketplace about the state of the bundle. And I\'m wondering if you could talk about the improvement you\'re expecting in affiliate revenues in the U.S. in particular, your relationships with some of the key MVPDs, particularly Charter, where, I believe, there\'s been some potential re-tiering. And then for you and/or Cyma, just on Nickelodeon. It was interesting. Hulu obviously is not carrying the network. Not a surprise. But they called out Nick\'s content on demand as a key part of their SVOD offers. Obviously, they see value there. How are you thinking about managing Nick\'s content distribution given the changing landscape? And are there opportunities, you think, for real revenue benefits on that business in the medium term from some of these shifts, maybe touching on your strategy for SVOD with Nick, in general? Thanks. Robert Bakish Thanks, Ben. A bunch of questions there. But look, there\'s a lot going on in the industry, for sure. There was recently some data on subs that probably were seeing some softness, too. It is worth noting that, that subscribing data is differentiated by distributor. Some operators actually grew subs while others declined. So while early, it does suggest there\'s some execution differences going on. But I think that\'s also - should be a rallying cry for the industry. We need to work together to ensure that the product and marketing better support industry performance. We\'re already engaging in that dialogue with really all of our partners and believe that this will probably be a catalyst for escalating those dialogues. And that, at the end of the day, is a good thing. We also think, among other things, it highlights the need for truly new consumer options. And we do think that this entertainment pack initiative fits perfectly as a low-priced entry point for some of the people that are not currently participating in the ecosystem and may have churn due to price points. So a lot going on there. With respect to Charter, in particular, we are aware of the issue. Worth noting, it appears to affect new subs only. It\'s not a broad re-tiering. I read something today that suggested it might be. But suffice it to say, this is in the context of an ongoing integration there. There is a difference of opinion on what\'s appropriate. We have a very strong point of view and are in conversations about it and I believe this will get resolved. And again, at a macro level, we continue to be focused on partnership with Charter and where there\'s other conversations going on and other MVPDs and are working to build and evolve the pay-TV ecosystem. On the Nickelodeon front, let me just touch on SVOD in general and then I\'ll let Cyma add some color to it. So again, we are principally focused on maintaining the value of the pay-TV ecosystem. It\'s why I made the decision earlier this year not to renew a set of properties with Hulu. That was something they were very interested in, to be clear. And I haven\'t seen Mike\'s commentary on that, but it doesn\'t surprise me because they do continue to have some product. We have to make sure, as an industry, that we are not creating inexpensive alternatives for consumers to access our best product. And so that has very much driven our current thinking on SVOD. Clearly, within that framework, there is an opportunity to put some product in SVOD, whether it\'s U.S. or international. In international, there\'s also the dimension of country and different markets or in different places with respect to pay-TV penetration and the like. But there are some things that make sense out there. So you can expect we would have some presence, at least on some platforms, but not in a high-volume, fresh kind of way. Cyma, you might want to add to that. Cyma Zarghami Sure. The product that we have on Hulu right now is primarily a set of our hits that have many seasons and many episodes. And we have our own - we have a deep library of content that fuels our own channels, six of our own platforms. But as we build out our consumer products business and capabilities, it is beneficial to our hits to have them in multiple places and multiple access to the consumers. And when they work, they work almost everywhere. And performance on television is not affected at all by that performance on Hulu. Ben Swinburne Thank you both. Wade Davis Operator, we’ll take our next question. Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go next to Rich Greenfield of BTIG. Richard Greenfield Hi, thanks for taking the question. Sort of a followup to the last one, the MVPDs, broadly, the facilities-based ones, they\'ve struggled to create kind of more flexible bundles. They\'ve got all of these legacy minimum distribution clauses that makes it hard to create bundles without broadcasters or without sports. But from what we can tell, it looks like they have a lot more flexibility. They want to create so-called virtual MVPDs or over-the-top bundles where they could actually launch bundles that don\'t have some of the legacy sports and broadcast channels. When you talk, Bob, about kind of new skinny bundles, are these the type of things - I mean, we sense Charter has been working on one of these kind of sports-less bundles. Rutledge has been pretty outspoken about the need for lower-cost bundles. AT&T\'s Stephenson\'s done the same. Just curious, like, is that the type of thing that you think could happen from existing distributors over the course of this year? Robert Bakish Yes. Thanks, Rich. So we\'re not privy to everyone\'s contracts on a specific level, clearly. But your general characterization, we would agree with. We do believe there are opportunities to create these skinnier bundles. And we\'re in very deep conversation with one particular entity right now about exactly that. And we do believe that, as we get a breakthrough here that will be a catalyst for more. Because look, at the end of the day, when you talk to people running these distribution companies, and I have met with the CEO of every one of them, everyone acknowledges that there\'s a marketplace opportunity here. And that\'s certainly based on their own data, which we haven\'t seen. It\'s based on international data where things exist. No one questions the opportunity. And again, I think, given what\'s going on in some of the - with the recent universe figures, it increases the need to provide alternative packaging options to consumers to bring them into the ecosystem. So yeah, I think there is a path where someone will create a structure that allows this to come to market, again, that\'s something we\'re working on. By the way, that probably or potentially includes the fact that broadcast signals are accessible via antennas and that offering is integrated in. So there are things going on here. There\'s a little bit of complexity, but we continue to be in a lot of conversations. And I\'m quite confident that we\'re going to get somewhere. Richard Greenfield Thanks very much. Operator We\'ll go next to Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Alexia Quadrani Thank you. Could you provide a bit more color on what you\'re currently seeing in the domestic ad market, how pricing is trending? And I know you mentioned we should expect some sequential improvement in the June quarter. Is that excluding the Easter - the benefit of the Easter shift? And then just a followup on the Paramount TV Studio. When you see such success as you have with 13 Reasons Why, I guess, could you just give us some color about how that may sort of maybe have an indirect benefit to the studio and your efforts there to put you more on the map? I guess, any color on that would be great. Robert Bakish Sure. So again, a bunch of questions there. Nice to hear from you, Alexia. On the ad market, look, we\'re feeling good about it. And as I indicated, we\'ve been -- and I\'ve personally been in a lot of conversations with the people running all the major agencies as part of a new approach to the upfront we\'re initiating this year, where instead of doing a single, very large presentation where we kind of broadcast information to 1,000 people, we\'ve been sitting down in a much more intimate, kind of agency-to-agency, in some cases, client-specific setting, where it\'s not only sales folks, myself, it\'s our flagship brand presidents and talking to them about what\'s going on. So we have a fair amount of read on the market. I\'d say, I\'m - we\'re definitely feeling good about it. There is, in terms of scatter market, some typical free upfront posturing. And I say this having been the Chief Operating Officer of domestic advertising sales in the kind of the first part of the 2000s. So this is not at all uncommon. I would say, big picture, the market is good. Supply is tight. I mean, that\'s the benefit of some of the other things that are going on. There is noise on digital, without question. And TV is well positioned. So I think the market is pretty good, and it\'s setting up nicely for the upfront. As far as the comps for the June quarter and your question about Easter, Easter is worth about a point to us. It was a -- so if you look at the March quarter and the June quarter, it did -- when we have the minus 4 in the June quarter, it is equivalent to minus 3 when you adjust for Easter. So if that\'s your question, that\'s the answer. As far as Paramount goes, they\'re - as I said in my formal remarks, there\'s a lot of great stuff going on at Paramount on the television production side. It really is a great time to be in the television production business. There is a lot of demand. And kind of one of the unique things that we have is, at Paramount, we have a deep library of stories that we\'re drawing on, some of them only relate to films that have been brought to market, some of them aren\'t. And we\'re really - it\'s early days, but we are having some great success in converting that into episodic television in a very financially attractive way to us. So I feel good about 13 Reasons. Why? It\'s clearly - like I said, it\'s the most tweeted-about show in 2017. There\'s a lot of discussion on it. Wait, it is a tough topic, and there\'s also discussions in school. I also want to point out that it is a TV mature-rated product. It\'s not for young children. But it\'s created a lot of interest. And it\'s probably something that has the potential to continue. Again, we haven\'t announced anything on that. But does that answer your question? Or you have anything else specifically on television production? Alexia Quadrani No, that\'s very helpful. Thank you so much. Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll go to Doug Mitchelson of UBS. Doug Mitchelson Thanks, so much. Bob, you\'ve already started to talk about shifts in your relationships with distributors and strategies with distributors. There\'s still a lot of concern for Viacom on affiliate revenue growth and the cadence. And you\'ve talked about providing more flexibility to distributors, and a lot of investors think that means less distribution for some of your networks, which means less affiliate revenue, less ad revenue. Can you square that up? Is giving distributors more flexibility the equivalent of less affiliate revenue for Viacom? Robert Bakish So we\'ve talked about not flexibility, per se, but broadening the partnership discussion. And what we mean by that specifically is, historically, our discussions were almost exclusively at renewal points and almost exclusively about - and really they were exclusively about carriage of linear fees and how much on-demand product was going to go along with that. Today, and again, we\'re in arranged conversations with very large MVPDs, kind of as we speak, the conversation is happening when there isn\'t a deal up, point one. Point two is, it is including other topics that can provide value from Viacom to distributors. I mentioned in my remarks about these two data pilots we have going on where we\'re literally inserting Vantage campaigns in local avails and having MSOs benefit financially from that. Now clearly, that\'s early days, but I\'m actually very happy to have two of those up and running already. So that\'s good news. As far as carriage of networks goes, you can think of our networks come in 3 flat - 3 tiers, if you will. You have the flagships, which we talked about. You have another set of broadly distributed networks, MTV, VH1 and TV Land, which all have up ratings in the last quarter. They\'re doing very well. All have strong consumer franchises. And then you have a set of, what we call, digital or suite services. The conversations that we had on that last category, historically was all about we want more distribution, more distribution. And really, that causes problems because they want services in tiers, et cetera. So we moved off that conversation. We\'re fine having those up there for hierarchy clients. Our principal focus is ensuring ongoing broad distribution of - in our flagships and this other widely distributed tier. And we\'re missing that carriage in some places, and we\'re in conversations about hopefully getting that back. But it\'s not about a notion of being totally flexible per se to carry anything you want. It is very much also about what Rich was talking about before, which is finding the catalyst for the entry point for this entertainment pack, because if you think about it, pay-TV has gotten very expensive. You\'re talking $100-plus ARPUs in a world where people have to pay for cellphones and the like and there\'s a lot of stress on that machine. We fundamentally believe that a lower-price option will be pretty compelling to people. And again, so there\'s a lot of conversation about that. Now clearly, that doesn\'t involve all of our services. It would involve the suite services, at least at the most basic, widely distributed tier, maybe as an option for other tiers. But the principal opportunity is on widely distributed service. And if you think about the Viacom brand in this, remember, we have the #1 preschool brand in the world with Nick Jr. Full Stop, the only kids channel Nickelodeon. Full stop. If MTV, which has had its bumps in the road, but I\'m telling you, and I would encourage you to ask an advertising agency that have been in our upfront dinners, there\'s a lot of excitement coming, whether it\'s Promposal, [indiscernible] or the return of TRL, this thing is going somewhere. And by the way, it\'s going somewhere in a not just linear way, all of these properties have, let\'s just call it, deep integration with non-television devices. In fact, the Promposal, we sourced hundreds of thousands of ideas off the Internet very quickly. So it\'s an integrated strategy. On the Comedy Central, the biggest problem with Comedy Central ratings in the last 18 months has been the transition of our late-night franchise. John and Steve have gone away. Trevor is starting to hit his stride, and we got Jordan coming in the fall with a half hour. That\'s really - that should be the new going-forward block. Jordan\'s been in a lot of our effort. He has been in lot of our upfront dinners. He\'s really funny. We have high hopes for that. So Comedy, I believe, it\'s already highly valued. It\'s the only brand of its kind in media. And it\'s on a path to continued improvement. And then you got BET far and away, number 1 in the African-American demographic. It has the biggest share in the market. We just did a series of upfront presentations there focusing on what they have coming up in some - in their late-night blocks, the comedy stuff, et cetera, it looks very strong. And finally, Paramount. That\'s a big story for us. So you think of just those six services, that\'s preschool to adults, including film, that\'s a killer block and a killer cornerstone at a really, potentially very attractive price point. So look, we got - we\'re working hard to work with our partners to evolve this business, but we fundamentally see opportunity here. And we\'re very focused on unlocking it. Doug Mitchelson Thanks, so much, Bob. Robert Bakish So there\'s one other thing that I would say, just because in the context of Viacom, and I know there\'s a lot of noise on this distribution point and I get it. But really you should focus on the broad range of opportunity that we\'re going at our company. There is distribution to recapture, and that\'s valuable to us. There is viewing share to grow, and we have a clear path to that. There is upside in domestic advertising. And that\'s on - based on growing our viewing share, that\'s based on pricing opportunity, particularly in the Spike to Paramount transition. That\'s based on growing our yield by continuing down the data-driven advertising path, something we\'re continuing to drive the industry on. There is international, additional international opportunity, and you see we have nice momentum there and there\'s no question that Paramount will turn. And as we\'re doing that, we\'re building a very nice television production business to go with it, which is key to having a valuable, sustainable studio. And then finally, there\'s real greenfield opportunities in digital where we have very small share, and there\'s obviously a lot of time spent viewing. And beyond media, what Cyma talked about, what we\'re doing in the hotel space, now Comedy Central, MTV are doing experiential stuff. Nickelodeon is coming next year with experiential stuff. There\'s a lot of opportunity there. So there\'s no question there\'s growth for Viacom as we navigate this changing world. Doug Mitchelson I appreciate all the color Bob. Operator We\'ll take our next question from John Janedis of Jefferies. John Janedis Thank you. Cyma, could you talk more about how advertisers are thinking about reaching the kids in the younger demo? Is it a shift away from the TV screen? How does the toy money look broadly in? And will the original hours at Nick need to increase annually going forward, given the competition?  Cyma Zarghami Sure. We have a bunch of categories that are consistent across our business, right? Obviously, toys, obviously the movie studios and the market looks good at the moment. So we\'re very optimistic with our share being up and the large sort of percentage of the share that we have in the ad market at the moment. And I think that the advantage to Nickelodeon and all of the ecosystem that we have built is that we are able to reach kids with mass simultaneous viewing opportunities that you really can\'t get anywhere else. And I think that is really one of our advantages. That, and the fact that we have an incredible stable -- an incredibly stable position at the moment and a clear path to some consistency with some real hits in the market. So we\'re feeling very optimistic about our position and the growth of our ecosystem, particularly on the Nick app and the Nick Jr. app. Robert Bakish Yes. And I\'d just add to that, really, kind of echo it. If you look at Nickelodeon, where it\'s come over the last couple of years, you could argue, two, three years ago, it was the SpongeBob network. And Cyma and her team took that as a serious challenge a couple of years ago and built this multi-genre, multi-demographic pipeline that you\'re seeing coming to fruition today, and among other things, delivering 10 of the top 10 shows on kids television and having those new franchises working today. And the top 3, by the way, aren\'t SpongeBob. It depends on which demographic you look at and you can get deeper than that. So that\'s something that you can\'t build overnight. And as we\'ve been seeing the benefit of that, our share lead versus our traditional competitors of Disney and Cartoon has actually grown. And so that\'s momentum that I\'m highly confident will continue going forward. And when you talk about advertising, you talk about supply and demand, right? So the supply is tight, and we have a larger share than we\'re used to. That\'s a great place to be going into a selling cycle. And the demand is strong, too, because you\'ve got a couple of key categories, and Cyma referenced them, toys, films and QSR, among others, that are also in good shape. So you put that together, that feels pretty good in the context of Nickelodeon in this upfront and having a really sustainable position in the marketplace. Wade Davis Last thing I\'d add with respect to that kid\'s ad market is that the characteristics around digital and the restrictions around digital for the kid\'s ad markets reduce the number of alternatives that are available for advertisers who want to reach children. And so it just further creates a dynamic in which Nickelodeon is must-buy for anybody who wants to reach kids. Robert Bakish By the way, the other thing I would say on Nick, which I think is interesting, and it goes probably to an underlying question you have in terms of, "Do you have to produce more stuff?" In the last two years, the other thing that\'s happened is, Nickelodeon has moved to sourcing ideas globally, not just from the U.S. And in fact, as proven, that you can have hits that come from outside the U.S. And that\'s very important because, a, it gets you a wider footprint of creative ideas. And b, the economics of those ideas are substantially superior to U.S.-produced ideas. So you are getting very high quality at a more attractive price point, which, on a total mix basis, helps manage your spending as you -- in this time, we\'ve ramped episode. And again, we\'re in a very unique position of being able to that given our assets. John Janedis That\'s helpful, thanks. And may be if I can sneak one in for Wade. Thanks for the update on the China slate financing. As you know, there\'s been a lot of noise and headlines around the payment. So is the takeaway that given the upsize commitment, that the funding concerns shouldn\'t be an issue and that payment is on track? And does the 30% mean that there\'s upside to the initial $1 billion? Wade Davis Yes. So despite everything that\'s written, we\'ve never really had concerns about payment. There is a payment schedule in the agreement, and we\'re going to receive cash this quarter per the schedule that was always in the agreement. And in terms of upside, yes, there is upside too from the 25% to the 30%, given that, as I said in my remarks, the deal in the aggregate still pertains to all films released in 2017. And so to the extent that there\'s 30%, that\'s upsized from what we\'ve been incorporating into our financial statements to date. John Janedis Thank you. Operator We\'ll go next to Michael Nathanson of MoffettNathanson. Michael Nathanson Thanks. I have one for Bob and one for Wade. Bob, now that you have time to take some cost actions, review programming schedules, look at the global footprint of the company, can you share expectations for cost growth over, let\'s say, the midterm, between programming and non-programming cost? And what\'s the right way to think about those two buckets? Robert Bakish Yeah. Look, we\'ve done a lot of work over the past six months or so, including a restructuring. We\'re not giving guidance at this point on specific elements of the P&L. What Wade said about the restructuring is worth echoing, which is, yes, there are savings in the restructuring. And some of those savings will drop to the bottom line, but they\'re also really a funding mechanism as we continue to strengthen our company and that\'s both with respect to programming, but more specifically, with respect to expanding into places where we don\'t have significant participation today. So we talked about setting up the digital business unit, which we\'re currently working on and building out some offerings there. So this is about - and I think a lot of this is story of Viacom, it\'s we\'re remixing. When you looked at - if you look at the brands - for the domestic brands, the pay-TV business, you\'re seeing our expense base getting remixed within brands. So the context of MTV, where we\'re shifting our mix to be much more back towards unscripted, back to mix change that has economic implications that allows the production of more hours at same price point, for example, we\'re shifting the mix of spending across brands. So an example of that would be shifting spending to the Paramount Network as we re-brand Spike and do that in January and March. And we\'ve started with advertisers about - talking about programming that\'s coming. It represents a substantial investment on a single network basis, but it\'s being funded as a remix. So that\'s how you should really be thinking about it. I don\'t know, Wade, if you want to add anything to that. Wade Davis Yeah, it\'s really - I mean, it\'s funding investments in future growth, right? I mean, when we rolled out our strategy, we did get a lot of questions specifically around digital and live events as to whether or not people should think of us needing to invest significant new dollars in executing against those initiatives and the answer is no. We are taking efficiencies that we\'ve been able to extract from other parts of the organization and have been able to reinvest the majority of those savings into initiatives that are going to generate growth in the future. Michael Nathanson Okay. And then Wade, can you just follow up on the slate financial question? So far, first half of the year, you\'ve seen the benefit at the studio and the ancillary line. Does that continue for the rest of the year or it - was that a first half kind of catch-up due to the slate financing? Wade Davis There will continue to be impact in fiscal \'17. And depending on how we elect to structure certain elements of the forward slates, there may be -- there may or may not be impact in the forward years. Michael Nathanson Okay. Thank you. Wade Davis Operator, we have time for one more question. Operator We\'ll go to Jessica Reif with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jessica Reif Cohen Thanks. I have two questions. First, I just wanted to go back to the advertising topic. Given the ramp-up in programming, particularly over the summer, can you talk about how you\'re approaching the upfront market, which takes place before a lot of its original programming takes place? And over what period of time do you expect the new consortium, the Open AP, to really have a significant impact? And on a completely different topic, on the film group, should we expect more restructuring charges as Jim Gianopulos comes in and brings in his own team? And is there anything, in your view, that he can do to fix the existing slate while his develops over the next, say, 18 to 24 months? If he develops his own slate, what can he do with the existing slate? Robert Bakish Sure. Thanks, Jessica. So in terms of the programming path and how that fits with the upfront, we have very much been talking about, as you\'d expect we would, I just think it\'s more significant given what\'s going on, about our going forward programming with all the agencies- we did a studio tour, as an example, to all the studios, showcasing the new MTV, showcasing the Paramount Network. So yes, that is very much part of our upfront process and will be part of our upfront transaction. For example, we\'re in conversations with advertisers about unique opportunities to participate potentially in creative ways on the relaunch or the rebrand to the Paramount Network. And there\'s some interest there. Absolutely, that\'s part of the dialogue. And certainly, we see this clear path to MTV ratings improvement. That\'s going to be part of the economics, if you will. In the context of Open AP, actually, I\'ll flip that to Wade because he\'s deeply involved in it and will probably give you the more precise answer. Wade Davis Yes. But I think your specific question is the timing of the impact -- timing and significance of the impact of Open AP. So as you probably know, that Open AP is not yet available. It won\'t be available until the beginning of the broadcast year. And over the course -- between now and then, we\'re going to continue to build participation in that. The enrolment period is open through the end of June. I guess, as of the beginning of next week, we will have met with every major network. And based on those meetings, we expect to significantly expand participation in the initiative. In terms of the impact that we - the magnitude of the impact that we expect it to have, even though it\'s not currently available, in the upfront, we\'re seeing Open AP as a significant factor driving interest and scale around audience-based buying. And I think, probably, it\'s important to point out that this is something - Open AP is something that we\'ve done in response to advertiser demand. Advertisers were asking for alignment of process and measurement to enable them to be able to take advantage of some of the advances around next-generation TV advertising, and in particular, audience-based buying. So the fact that we\'re seeing very strong interest materialize in the upfront ahead of any availability from an advertisers\' standpoint, which is kind of the actual expression of their early interest that generated the initiative, and the fact that we\'re seeing strong interest from other networks in participating in the initiative, all cause us to continue to be very optimistic about what Open AP is going to enable for us and the rest of the industry. Robert Bakish And then moving to Paramount, Jim, here\'s a couple of things. One is it goes to the execution point. There\'s a lot of things you have to do once you have a film so you got to distribute it. You got to market it. You have to drive ancillary value, other window values, sales, et cetera. So there\'s a bunch of stuff that he will certainly - and is already working on improving execution that will create value and then on the films themselves, they\'re not all made yet. So even though you have a slate and you have films in production, you do screenings, you fine-tune them. And he will certainly participate in that process. So I think we will feel - I know we will feel Jim\'s impact. I already have. And by the way, the employees on the lot also feel and they\'re very excited about it. So you\'ll see that value begin to feather in. Wade Davis I would just add, more specifically, in terms of what impact we expect to see Jim to deliver on the 2018 slate. I mean, I\'ve been extraordinarily impressed on how fast he\'s hit the ground running and how he\'s really rallied the existing team and brought in select new talent. We brought in a very senior person in television licensing. But as said, you asked the question about, "Is he going to bring in his own new team on a wholesale basis?" And one of the things I\'ve been most impressed is how he has come in and immediately improved and refined certain processes that needed to be improved. But almost most importantly, he\'s really jump-started the culture there and engaged the existing team in ways that are really impressive to see. And in terms of how that\'s likely to manifest itself, if your question about his ability to impact the \'18 slate, I mean, obviously, some of the films have been made, but not all of them. As it relates to the films that have been made, he\'s been very, very specific and targeted around things that he can do to improve the expected performance of those films by looking at refining the release strategy. I think, based on some of the things that he\'s focused on, there\'s significant upside in the marketing and releasing costs in certain of those films. And it\'s also really important to remember that Jim\'s roots are in international. And as the international market becomes more important overall, that that\'s something that Jim is bringing increased focus and perspectives on. So all those things are examples of things that we expect to have a positive impact on \'18 despite the fact that, as you point out, many, but not all, of the films have been made. Robert Bakish Yes. And the other thing, and maybe this is obvious, but he\'s really in it. He\'s not letting this thing fly on autopilot. He\'s in all facets of it, and he brings deep expertise and knowledge to the table across many, many areas. So we\'re very optimistic about the studio under Jim\'s leadership. Jessica Reif Cohen Right. And then just one - that was an amazing outlook, really great answer. I mean very - that\'s a lot of color. But the last question, should we expect any more restructuring charges from Film in the next quarter? Wade Davis There may be some additional restructuring charges, but they\'ll be very modest. So a lot of times when people see a new studio has come in, they\'re afraid, to your first question, that they\'re going to disrupt the team and the operational continuity, but also that they\'re just going to kind of flush a bunch of the product that they didn\'t have their name on. And Jim doesn\'t bring kind of a lot of ego to that question. He\'s very objective in looking at the product that he thinks is going to work and how to optimize that product from an economic point of view. So either that\'s translated into kind of a very practical and targeted approach that is not - we don\'t anticipate anything significant. There may be - really, to the extent that there\'s any write-offs, they\'re largely going to be on projects that are in kind of a earlier, mid-stage development that Jim doesn\'t see the kind of potential for to actually make in the movies.

Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division Operator Good day, and welcome to the Virgin Media Q1 2013 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Richard Williams, please go ahead, sir. Richard Williams Thank you. Good morning or afternoon to you all, and welcome to Virgin Media's Q1 results call. Today's call may make reference to the proposed transaction with Liberty Global, which we announced in February. Please, may I direct you to the statements on Slide 2, which tells you where you can get more information about the proposed transaction and which should be read in conjunction with any statements made on today's call about the proposed transaction. In addition, please let me draw your attention to the Safe Harbor statement on Slide 3, where we set our cautionary disclosures, which should be read with any forward-looking statements we make today. I'll also point out that we will be mentioning certain non-GAAP measures today. The required disclosures with respect to these can be found in the slide appendixes. And now, I'll turn you over to Neil Berkett. Neil A. Berkett Thanks, Richard, and thanks for joining the call, everybody. As in all probability, this will be our last set of results as an independent company. We're deliberately, and I think quite appropriately, going to give a fairly short actual presentation. I'm going to run through about 6 slides and then Eamonn will join me for the Q&A. So we've had a good start to the year with accelerated revenue growth and improved churn and very strong free cash flow growth. Importantly, we put through a 5% price increase without any noticeable adverse effects. I'll quickly run through the highlights. Firstly, we delivered revenue growth of 3.6%, underpinned by a 7% cable revenue growth. ARPU grew 5.2%, customer growth was 9,000 and were supported by lower churn.  Business revenue growth remains lumpy and was negative in the quarter, but we signed a number of large new backhaul deals, which gives us good confidence going forward, more on that in the moment. OCF grew 5.8% to GBP 399 million, but this was affected by GBP 8 million of cost relating to the announced merger with Liberty Global. OCF for these merger-related costs was GBP 406 million, or up 8%.  Free cash flow was up 54% to GBP 135 million. If you baked the $8 million merger cost, again, it would've been GBP 142 million, or up 63%. So my next slide is a repeat of the slide we presented for the last few quarters, updated, obviously for Q1. We continue to generate sustainable modest revenue growth through multiple leaders. In respect to customer growth, our base has grown by 1.6% in the last 12 months, reduced churn remains the main driver. In fact, it was down year-on-year for the sixth quarter in a row to 1.1%. From a pricing point of view, the most important activity in the quarter, was in fact the 5% price increase we put through in February. For the second year in a row, I was pleased it has landed very well and did not stimulate churn. This is because increased product differentiation is underpinning our ability to increase price. We've been doubling broadband speeds for over 4 million broadband customers. TiVo is transforming the digital entertainment experience and more cable customers are taking a great value mobile service from us. Moving on to TMX. This continues to improve across the product set. Over 40% of broadband gross ads takes 60 meg or above, an incredible statistic.  Our pay TV mix improved also driven by TiVo, which is now up to 40% penetration. In respect to product cross sell, we've improved triple play to 65% and quad-play to 16%, adding 37,000 triple play and 18,000 quad-play customers. Mobile cross-sell into the cable base continues to driver contract growth, with subscribers up 10% year-on-year. With respect to Business Data, we've signed 3 major backhaul deals, which will underpin revenue growth going forward. Overall, our multiple revenue drivers give us continued confidence that we can continue to drive sustainable revenue growth. We continue to lead the market in superfast broadband to attractively priced bundles. Our speed doubling program is driving this further, leveraging off the technical and economic supremacy of our network. Over 85% of the network has now been upgraded for doubled speeds with the remainder on track to complete by the middle of the year. We're driving a fundamental shift in mix. We're growing the superfast broadband base that is 30 meg and above, by 338,000 this quarter. This is underpinning growth in our total broadband base, which is up 37,000. Again, this really demonstrates strong demand for high speeds and the success of our collections. This is not a niche market, as I've said. It's a mass market. We now have 58% on 30 meg or higher, but what really stands out and shows how differentiated our customer base is, is that 1 year ago, 69% of our base was on 10 meg or lower. In other words, that we're getting speeds similar to normal ADSL. Fast forward to today, and only 9% are on 10 meg or below. This is a key reason why our churn has been so strong. Superfast customers do not want to trade down to ADSL speeds with one of our competitors, particularly when our superfast pricing is so competitive. We offer a 30 meg product for just GBP 14.50. Moving on to TV, where our differentiated TiVo service has mass market appeal, and is driving pay TV growth, customer satisfaction and improved mix.  We now have 1.5 million TiVo subscribers and have penetrated 40% of our TV base in less than 2 years of above the line marketing. The success of Virgin Media TiVo is helping drive pay TV growth. We added a further 14,000 pay TV subscribers in Q1. In the last 12 months, we've added 165,000 pay TV subscribers and our three-tier is now quite deliberately down to 13% of our TV base. In mobile, we've seen continued improvements in our contract mix, but regulated mobile termination rate cuts continue to distort the picture and it has resulted in flat overall revenue for the quarter, with contract service also flat at GBP 99 million. Regulated MTR cuts reduced our inbound mobile revenue by about GBP 7 million in the quarter.  Mobile revenue would have grown by 4.5% without this. But full year, we're expecting MTR impact to be less than last year at around GBP 18 million, and will largely disappear in 2014. We'll see this help growth in the second half of this year. We continue to focus on cross-selling contracts into cable homes with 1.2 million contract handsets in cable homes now, up 12% year-on-year. This is also helping to drive quad-play penetration, with subscribers up 11% year-on-year and penetration now reaching 16%. In business, as we've seen before, significant contracts can cause some unevenness or lumpiness in revenues from quarter-to-quarter, especially at this stage of our growth cycle. Revenue in this particular quarter was down 4%, reflecting lower voice and installed revenues. Since the start of the year, we are seeing improved sales momentum compared to the second half of last year, with the first quarter being the strongest in the last 6 quarters. We've just signed a significant tenure deal for Telefonica U.K. for the provision of backhaul 1,500 sites. And we've secured significant orders under a framework agreement to support the creation of a U.K.-wide aggregation network for another large U.K. mobile operator. This means that we now have material backhaul contracts with all of the U.K. mobile operators. We've also secured a significant 5-year deal backhaul contracts with Sky. We expect to see the revenues from these new contracts benefit the second half of this year and I remain confident that the underlying growth rate, the business revenue continues to remain strong. I'll now very quickly run through the financial details, starting with the revenue breakdown. We had a very encouraging performance in cable with growth 7%, driven by both customer and ARPU growth. Mobile was flat in the face of the GBP 7 million MTR headwind and as discussed, business revenues were down 4%. This all results in a 3.6% total revenue growth. As you can see from my final slide, accelerated revenue growth and strong operating leverage led to strong OCF and very strong free cash flow growth. Gross margin percentage expanded to 59%, SG&A was up 1.8%, driven mainly by the GBP 8 million of merger-related costs. Without these, SG&A would have fallen by 1.9%. This resulted in OCF up 6% and OCF before merger related costs up 8% to GBP 406 million. Net interest was down 15%, reflecting last year's refinancing. Cash CapEx was down 5% and was within our 15% to 17% stated guidance. This is despite us continuing to spend CapEx on broadband upgrades and our TiVo rollout. This resulted in free cash flow up 54% to GBP 135 million, ignoring the GBP 8 million merger related costs and would've been up 63% to GBP 142 million for the quarter. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.  [Operator Instructions] Back to you, operator. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Paul Sidney of Crédit Suisse. Paul Sidney - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division I just have a question on the monthly data usage,  please. And I'm just wondering if you could give us any stats on what the average date usage is for household currently, and how that's evolved over the past few quarters, just to give us a sense in what high-speed broadband or superfast broadband is doing to the levels of demand for the data usage. Neil A. Berkett Yes, Paul, it continues to grow. I don't have the exact metrics at hand, but we continue to grow daily consumption around 45% per annum. This quarter's been no different. We obviously carry data both in terms of across our DOCSIS network for broadband and from memory, that's just over 42 gig. And then on a monthly basis, and then on top of that, we carry about another 15 gig from memory in our closed DVB-C network, but we can give you the exact data. The key underlying trend is daily consumption remains at circa 15% growth per annum. Operator We will now take our next question from Tim Boddy of Goldman Sachs. Timothy Boddy - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division I just wanted to ask about the -- in terms of the merger announcements. Obviously, I'm sure your -- the work with Liberty Group has continued, just if you could talk a bit about any further opportunities for knowledge sharing or other synergy opportunities that you might have identified during that process? Neil A. Berkett Tim, I don't really have anything further to add than what Mike and I said obviously publicly.  Obviously, we do continue to have conversations and I'm comfortable that we continue to understand each other more. And the rationale for why the transaction taking place is absolutely there. I'm sorry, I'm not in the position to be able to provide any more specifics than that. Operator We will now take our next question from Bryan Kraft of Evercore Partners. Bryan D. Kraft - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division I just wanted to ask you, historically, why haven't you targeted the small business segment? And do you think that's a significant opportunity going forward? If I could just sneak in very small second one. How did your on-boarding ARPU for new customers today compare to that of 1 year ago? Neil A. Berkett Okay. So let me pick up both of those. Look, there is strong logic for us to enter the SME market front. It's a function of ensuring that your change pipeline doesn't give you indigestion, quite frankly. And with everything we've been doing over the last 2 or 3 years in terms of product development, both across enterprise and consumer, it hasn't reached the top of the list. We are in the process of running pilots. They are interesting and we are learning. It's a slightly different opportunity here in the U.K. than it is in the U.S., for example, principally, in terms of where we are.  But I'm comfortable that as we do accelerate into the SME space, it could provide some additional opportunity to the B rate that you're seeing in B2B today. In respect to on boarding ARPU, on boarding ARPU is higher than it was this time 12 months ago.  We continue to attract a high level of data steady customers. You can see that by the individual metrics that we give you, 60 meg and above being at 40% of growth is a pretty good indicator of a strong ARPU. So on boarding ARPU continues to be strong, which is reflected in a 5.2% increase in ARPU for the quarter. Operator We will now take our next question from Dan Wright of Deutsche Bank. David-A Wright - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division David Wright of Deutsche Bank. So I just wanted to ask you guys about quad-play. You've clearly had very good traction this quarter with that and I think historically, you've shown a very low churn rate from quad-play. If you could give us an update on your thinking there. And I guess just on that same subject, so maybe not a second question. Just your view of the future, whether you will be using home spot technology, as in the Wi-Fi, to create the kind of the local Wi-Fi network as it were. Just your sort of vision maybe over the next couple of years for quad-play would be really interesting. Neil A. Berkett David, I think as we've spoken, this is, to me, fixed-to-mobile convergence, both in the consumer and enterprise space, is proven. I think we -- in owning one of those networks, and I think owning a fixed network is a much easier way to go. You can continue to prove out the theory. And 16% quad-play penetration is more than theory. I mean, we do use customer lifetime value methodology in VMED. You get a higher CLV for a customer that's got mobile over and above what you would get for the same lone CLV of the mobile product, and that's broadly driven by churn. And we're now at a point of critical mass where the sort of natural bias you get with early adopters has dissipated and that continues to provide a very, very solid economics. And it is driven by churn. It's been a while since we've disclosed that churn, but not materially different from our early days of disclosure. I mean, I think there is a very strong strategic and economic case for us starting to accelerate into the mobile space over the next couple of years as we build those platforms that start to leverage, part of your second question, which is how do we make our mobile even more relevant to our cable customers. Well, the way you do that is you've got a shared billing platform, shared capability to transfer product and in fact, you've got a shared network. So more and more, we would like to see our mobile customers using our network. In that respect, you're seeing us moving into Wi-Fi. And that is across a full array of what we do. I mean, clearly, we will think about splitting our modems in home, such that we can create more of a critical mass in Wi-Fi, as well as Wi-Fi dedicated in the home. We're exploring small cell technology in a whole range of different urban environments in conjunction with some of the MNOs.  We're using our fiber access network. We can create small cell technology that will allow seamless transport of IP from cell towers, macro cells through the micro cells, through the Wi-Fi. And the art is each of the technology starts to evolve, it's going to be the organizations that are capable of safely carrying the consumer or the enterprise across each of those various piece of technologies, such that you get a seamless shift from, if you like, 4G into a semi-fixed world off the back of Wi-Fi. On about, [ph] I think the whole area of fixed to mobile convergence and the technologies that go with it will play further into the connectivity advantage that cable operators have. We've got this huge advantage in terms of an amazing fiber access network wherever cable operates and therefore, being able to leverage that into the broader FMC world. We'll continue to make a strategic advantage. Operator We will now take our next question from Nick Lyall of UBS. Nick Lyall - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Just a quick one on the Sky's Sports price increase. Can you maybe just give us an update where you got to on the timing of any -- and any details you can give us too, on appeal on the CAT judgment?  And if not, what's the plan B there? Is there any chance of seeing a reduction in pricing soon? Neil A. Berkett Well, we continue to have the conversations and in all likelihood, we're going to end in the wrong space, I suspect, in terms of the CAT review. But we are Sky's largest distributor of both premium and basic product. We have -- I use the word frenemy. We have a relationship, which I think is appropriate from a wholesale point of view. We've just announced today how that relationship is reciprocated by us and now starting to move towards taking their backhaul. And I think in that sort of arrangement, you should be able to work together in a wholesale sense and then that evening compete in a retail sense, and I think you'll see more of that. And we are in, as we are with all of our suppliers, continual debate and negotiation around commercial pricing. There's nothing new in that respect. Operator We will now take our next question from Adam Rumley of HSBC. Adam M. Rumley - HSBC, Research Division I just have a quick question on the backhaul deals you've announced today. If you look forward a year, say, can you give us any indication of what proportion of the total business revenue, those will represent? I just wanted to get an idea of the kind of scale of that business to you? Neil A. Berkett I think it has significant opportunity, Adam. I don't think it's appropriate for us to give guidance in terms of the scale of that. The fact that we have the everything everywhere cell sites, we've nominated how many there are, we've done the same thing with Telefonica. We're obviously in the process of doing backhaul for another operator.  Similarly, we do backhaul for TalkTalk, we're now going to do it for Sky. So where we are advantaged, which is just over half of the country, in terms of our access network, I think we have a real alternative to data retailers for their backhaul.  And you're seeing that success over the last, well it's only been 12 months. So do I think we're going to have a 50% share of that market on that? That's probably a bit aggressive. But certainly, we've now got a toehold in all of the mobile operators that will allow us to extend it, and more than a toehold, with the 2 resellers of BT product. Adam M. Rumley - HSBC, Research Division So it's right to think of these deals as first basis of a greater pipe to pursue? Neil A. Berkett I think, as bullish as I was with David over FMC, I am bullish in our capability to provide the alternative backhaul arrangements for all of the carriers here in the U.K. Operator We will now take our next question from Neila  [indiscernible] from Deutsche Bank. Unknown Analyst I had a question on TiVo add. I just wanted to know the split between the old and the new subscribers to the platform. Neil A. Berkett We haven't given that, that level of detail, 172,000 for the quarter. It is predominantly new as it was in the previous quarter, but we haven't given the detailed split. We will [indiscernible] to move in terms of using this as an acquisition tool as well as a retention tool. So it'll actually move between the 2, depending on the circumstances. But at the moment, I think from your modeling point of view, you can assume that it's pretty even if slightly biased to new at the moment. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Malcolm of Arete Research. Stephen Paul Malcolm - Arete Research Services LLP I'll go for the sneaky two-part question, but both on television. I guess both, looking at both ends of the TV spectrum, first of all, in the quarter, do you see any kind of noticeable impact from you getting first of all more aggressive on the market? And secondly, with respect on your XL TV package, I mean, how comfortable are you? We haven't seen that wholesale deal with BT yet, but as ESPN effectively disappears in the next few months, that you've got the right tools to your disposal to protect what is still roughly 1/2 the TV base when the new football season starts in August. Neil A. Berkett Steve, I think if we had not preempted connected TV as we did a couple of years ago, the situation may well have been quite different with you. But the fact that we were first mover, and are still and I think we'll always be best mover, given the funding and economic situation for a connected TV for ourselves, means that we're not really seeing any sort of impact competitively. I remind you that we quite deliberately launched Classics, which is effectively the same product set that sits on YouView, but on a TiVo platform. So our customers can, for the same prices, fiber in YouView, get fiber in TiVo. So again, we positioned ourselves from the consumer's point of view to be able to cover the ground. And that product is not proving to be delusionary, it's proving to be, if anything, additive. So we're tapping into a market that perhaps we weren't there. I'm comfortable, in the second part of your television-related question, I'm comfortable that we have the tools to ensure that our XL customers will remain advocates. I'm hopeful that we will end up with the right solution in respect to BT sports and that may come in, in a flavor that is different from where we're looking at the moment, who knows? We're having appropriate commercial conversations as we do with all of our suppliers. I mean, clearly, sports is a little bit more emotive and it maybe hits the front page of the press all the time, but we don't really treat it any differently from any other piece of contenders. We evaluate what is worth to us and that's what we're prepared to pay and obviously at the triple point where you go above that, it's because you believe that economically, you're better without it. I'm not signaling anything from there, I'm just giving you our general philosophy as to how we approach content. I'm comfortable, to the core of your question, that we have the tools at our disposal to ensure that our XL customers remain happy. Operator [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Laurie Davison of Deutsche Bank. Laurie Davison - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division It's just a quick question about the escrow. Could you just confirm the amount that's held in escrow at the moment under the CAT ruling? Neil A. Berkett Laurie, we haven't actually disclosed it. So I think on that basis, I can't really answer your question, but it's still sitting there. Operator [Operator Instructions] Neil A. Berkett Operator, if there are no more questions, I suggest I'll just do a wrap up. Operator There is one further question, would you like to take it? It comes from Matthew Harrigan of Wunderlich Securities. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division Could you update us on the Virgin TV, anywhere in getting the parity with the feature set with SkyGo and how you are seeing consumers react to that, thus far? Neil A. Berkett So we just launched another 21 channels, Matthew. So with the exception of premium, we've broadly got parity with Sky, in terms of channel. In terms of product feature, it's a superior product because it links back to the TiVo brain, so it includes the recommendation characteristics that sit on our TiVo platform. So it is -- our consumers will consume product and discover product wherever they are.  It's a natural extension to our TiVo world. A lot of the consumption still is sitting on our own Wi-Fi, sitting in the home. So somebody watching catch-up.  And as we progress in terms of our TiVo rollout, you'll see TV Anywhere accessing the hard drive of your TiVo box from, aside from wherever you happen to be. So it becomes very much an integrated part of our offering. And back to the question that David was asking earlier in respect to quad-play, it's one of those applications that will ensure that customers will demand seamless carriage across fixed and mobile and Wi-Fi, and whatever other mechanism.  So I'm bullish in terms of its ability to be able to continue to drive advocacy within our customer base and therefore, our ability to, in some shape or form, monetize it. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division And you'll have an Android app on that very shortly, I assume? Neil A. Berkett We will. I can't remember the exact drop date, but it's within the next few months, yes. And look, with that, I'd just like to thank you, all, for the support you've given us during our period. In particular, my period as COO and then CEO over the last 7 or 8 years. I'm very, very proud of what the Virgin Media team have managed to do. I think it's a fantastic achievement and it's reflected, obviously, in the price and value that we've created for the Liberty Global shareholders going forward. So thank you very much for your support, and thank you to the Virgin Media people that made it happen. Thanks very much, indeed. Cheers. Operator That will conclude today's conference call.

Rumley - HSBC, Research Division So it's right to think of these deals as first basis of a greater pipe to pursue? Neil A. Berkett I think, as bullish as I was with David over FMC, I am bullish in our capability to provide the alternative backhaul arrangements for all of the carriers here in the U.K. Operator We will now take our next question from Neila  [indiscernible] from Deutsche Bank. Unknown Analyst I had a question on TiVo add. I just wanted to know the split between the old and the new subscribers to the platform. Neil A. Berkett We haven't given that, that level of detail, 172,000 for the quarter. It is predominantly new as it was in the previous quarter, but we haven't given the detailed split. We will [indiscernible] to move in terms of using this as an acquisition tool as well as a retention tool. So it'll actually move between the 2, depending on the circumstances. But at the moment, I think from your modeling point of view, you can assume that it's pretty even if slightly biased to new at the moment. Operator Our next question comes from Steve Malcolm of Arete Research. Stephen Paul Malcolm - Arete Research Services LLP I'll go for the sneaky two-part question, but both on television. I guess both, looking at both ends of the TV spectrum, first of all, in the quarter, do you see any kind of noticeable impact from you getting first of all more aggressive on the market? And secondly, with respect on your XL TV package, I mean, how comfortable are you? We haven't seen that wholesale deal with BT yet, but as ESPN effectively disappears in the next few months, that you've got the right tools to your disposal to protect what is still roughly 1/2 the TV base when the new football season starts in August. Neil A. Berkett Steve, I think if we had not preempted connected TV as we did a couple of years ago, the situation may well have been quite different with you. But the fact that we were first mover, and are still and I think we'll always be best mover, given the funding and economic situation for a connected TV for ourselves, means that we're not really seeing any sort of impact competitively. I remind you that we quite deliberately launched Classics, which is effectively the same product set that sits on YouView, but on a TiVo platform. So our customers can, for the same prices, fiber in YouView, get fiber in TiVo. So again, we positioned ourselves from the consumer's point of view to be able to cover the ground. And that product is not proving to be delusionary, it's proving to be, if anything, additive. So we're tapping into a market that perhaps we weren't there. I'm comfortable, in the second part of your television-related question, I'm comfortable that we have the tools to ensure that our XL customers will remain advocates. I'm hopeful that we will end up with the right solution in respect to BT sports and that may come in, in a flavor that is different from where we're looking at the moment, who knows? We're having appropriate commercial conversations as we do with all of our suppliers. I mean, clearly, sports is a little bit more emotive and it maybe hits the front page of the press all the time, but we don't really treat it any differently from any other piece of contenders. We evaluate what is worth to us and that's what we're prepared to pay and obviously at the triple point where you go above that, it's because you believe that economically, you're better without it. I'm not signaling anything from there, I'm just giving you our general philosophy as to how we approach content. I'm comfortable, to the core of your question, that we have the tools at our disposal to ensure that our XL customers remain happy. Operator [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from Laurie Davison of Deutsche Bank. Laurie Davison - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division It's just a quick question about the escrow. Could you just confirm the amount that's held in escrow at the moment under the CAT ruling? Neil A. Berkett Laurie, we haven't actually disclosed it. So I think on that basis, I can't really answer your question, but it's still sitting there. Operator [Operator Instructions] Neil A. Berkett Operator, if there are no more questions, I suggest I'll just do a wrap up. Operator There is one further question, would you like to take it? It comes from Matthew Harrigan of Wunderlich Securities. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division Could you update us on the Virgin TV, anywhere in getting the parity with the feature set with SkyGo and how you are seeing consumers react to that, thus far? Neil A. Berkett So we just launched another 21 channels, Matthew. So with the exception of premium, we've broadly got parity with Sky, in terms of channel. In terms of product feature, it's a superior product because it links back to the TiVo brain, so it includes the recommendation characteristics that sit on our TiVo platform. So it is -- our consumers will consume product and discover product wherever they are.  It's a natural extension to our TiVo world. A lot of the consumption still is sitting on our own Wi-Fi, sitting in the home. So somebody watching catch-up.  And as we progress in terms of our TiVo rollout, you'll see TV Anywhere accessing the hard drive of your TiVo box from, aside from wherever you happen to be. So it becomes very much an integrated part of our offering. And back to the question that David was asking earlier in respect to quad-play, it's one of those applications that will ensure that customers will demand seamless carriage across fixed and mobile and Wi-Fi, and whatever other mechanism.  So I'm bullish in terms of its ability to be able to continue to drive advocacy within our customer base and therefore, our ability to, in some shape or form, monetize it. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division And you'll have an Android app on that very shortly, I assume? Neil A. Berkett We will. I can't remember the exact drop date, but it's within the next few months, yes. And look, with that, I'd just like to thank you, all, for the support you've given us during our period. In particular, my period as COO and then CEO over the last 7 or 8 years. I'm very, very proud of what the Virgin Media team have managed to do. I think it's a fantastic achievement and it's reflected, obviously, in the price and value that we've created for the Liberty Global shareholders going forward. So thank you very much for your support, and thank you to the Virgin Media people that made it happen. Thanks very much, indeed. Cheers. Operator That will conclude today's conference call.

Thank you for coming to our year-end results presentation. A special welcome to Peter Moyo, who sits in the first row. Peter is the outgoing Chairman of Vodacom. Peter is going to run a listed company very soon. I think you\'re here to basically get the credit for the wonderful contribution. And hopefully, we\'ll also learn something, but Peter, it\'s great to have you here in such a good day\'s for Vodafone\'s results. So as we have had two big transactions post Project Spring, we thought it was good to change a little bit the format of today\'s presentation. I will go through a little bit longer illustration of results at the beginning, but I will not go into the details of the countries. You still have the details of the country in the appendix, and you will be able to get the usual things, but I will try to stay a little bit at the higher level. Then Nick will go through the financial review, as always. And then I will come back and give an update of our strategy across Vodafone post these transactions post Project Spring and try to give the sense of direction for Vodafone towards 2020. And then of course, Nick and I will take questions from you. A reminder: India is not included, due to IFRS accounting rules, into the numbers, but again, for India as well, you have all the details in the appendix. So let\'s start with the full year highlights. I have to say we had a good year, 1.9% organic revenue growth. This is growth in both fixed and mobile. And in most of our customer -- in our markets, we are gaining share. Good results on EBITDA, 5.8% EBITDA growth. This is a 130 basis points margin expansion. Nick will cover operating leverage but also cost reduction that has been successful in the year, 29.7% margin. Cash flow goes up three times. Of course, CapEx levels are going back to the normal level post Project Spring, 7.7 billion invested; 4.1 billion cash flow but 4.3 billion in guidance terms. And finally, the board this morning agreed to increase the dividend by 2% to €0.1477, which is consistent with our intention of having a progressive dividend policy. So overall, including India, we have met our guidance last year. Now let\'s have a look at the three areas of the group. First of all, Europe. In Europe, as you can see from the red part of the chart, we continue to have good commercial momentum: 1 million contract net adds across the piece, 1.2 million broadband homes added and 1.6 million NGN homes. We are again the fastest-growing NGN and broadband provider throughout Europe. AMAP ex India, the blue part in the center, continues to grow very well. We have a 6.8 percentage growth. We added 9.7 million customers in the year and 7.5 million data active users in the year. Now this chart doesn\'t say, but even in AMAP we have growth in fixed broadband, 300,000 homes, mostly in Egypt and Turkey. And finally, the third part is India. Now of course, India, as we all know, has been challenged by the entrance of Jio. We had in the last quarter a minus 11.5% growth. This is actually in-line or better than the two reference competitors. We have seen the numbers yesterday. The good news is that we are retaining now voice and data users. We have, well, actually increasing data customers in the last quarter. Data customers have gone up to 38 million from 35 million, 3G and 4G, and so we see some signs that our, let me say, sacrifice of ARPU is working commercially in India. Now as I said, I don\'t want to go into the details market by market. You have them in the appendix, but let me still give you an overview of how things went across the piece. First of all, our strategy of customer differentiation based on network and customer experience measured by the NPS; as you can see from the chart, number one in Germany, number one in Italy, number one in Spain. We are not number one in the U.K. In the U.K., as you all know, we had technical issues. Now we have a pretty well-working network; number one data and voice in London, number one voice outside of London and good performance on data. We have fixed the billing mistakes. Now billing mistakes are practically eliminated. And we have halved the number of complaints that are coming into the call centers, which now have also very good response in average 14 seconds we take calls, which is down 96% from the six, seven minutes that was the case seven month ago. So not a great performance yet perceived by all the customers, but for sure, the basic operations are now in good shape. The central block is the growth. I already commented on mobile and fixed growth. One -- just one comment on Italy: It looks like a negative on prepaid, but the reality is that the active prepaid numbers, customer numbers in Italy are actually stabilized. And we are doing pretty well across the piece instead on the mobile front. And finally, the piece of the slide that I really like, the bottom part, service revenue growth, EBITDA growth. As you can see, we have positive leverage almost everywhere, exception of course the U.K. In Germany, despite MTR headwinds, 1.9%; 4.5% of EBITDA. In Italy, despite a very competitive headline market, we are going 2.3%; and an amazing 10% at EBITDA level, excellent drop-down on costs here by our local colleagues. And Spain, ex handsets financing, 4% growth, 8% EBITDA growth, again a very good job done on cost and an excellent job done especially on IT cost. As I said, in the U.K. the financial performance clearly lags the operational recovery, minus 3.3%. Here there have been the famous billing issues. We have roaming hits. There\'s also some accounting stuff, but again, as I said, the important thing in the U.K., we have fixed the basic operations now. There\'s a lag, and then it will come also to the financials. Emerging markets, again a fairly similar picture: number one in South Africa, number one in India, number one Egypt, number two by a small amount in Turkey; and I have to say, good customer growth with good increase in usage, and this is important. Underlying usage, voice up 10%, data up 78% in AMAP. So the essential classic engine of customer end-usage growth continues to work in AMAP. Given the presence of the outgoing Chairman, I have to say, South Africa, amazing. Peter, excellent performance on contract. I mean this is the lowest churn I\'ve ever heard in mobile in the world on contract, 3.2% churn on an yearly basis. This means 100% essentially of the customers are happy. And excellent growth in data, 1.4 million data customers added in the year, 19 million total; and amazing data analytics and CVM machine that we are replicating throughout emerging markets. So it\'s not surprising that the result is continued growth of revenues and adjusted EBITDA growth of 7.5%. But also, if you look at Turkey, you look at Egypt, 30% growth in Turkey. Here again, good job on the commercial front but also rationalization of A&R, rationalization of costs, 30% EBITDA of growth; 22.7% in Egypt, where I was recently, again another great CVM machine in Egypt. Actually, we are gaining market share despite the fact that we are very high -- so that actually could be the next target in South Africa, Peter. So pretty good. Now, India, as you would expect, a more negative performance. Q4 prices still see voice negative 15% and data around the same number. The good news is that we start seeing stabilization of recharges. And so despite the fact that we have put more costs in it and we have a broader presence, we think we have another couple of quarters of pressure, but probably the pressure will start easing off towards quarter three. And as I said, we are now operational in 18 circles with 4G, so fully competitive; and building our customers, which is an important thing in that context. So before handing over to Nick, I don\'t talk about the small markets. We have a number of good stories also in our smaller markets, but they are in your pack, in appendix. Just a quick snapshot on the -- on Q4. Blue part, this is the customer side of the story. We are ending the year in 19 out of 21 markets leader or coleader in consumer NPS. We have very strong markets for voice everywhere and third fourth of the markets for data. And we have now reached 36 million homes passed in our own footprint and 96 million total on the -- so -- on the whole footprint, so pretty good progress from the customer point of view. We continued to grow, in the fourth quarter, in the three chosen engines, 62% growth in data; record NGN, as I said. And enterprise continues to grow, 2%. And the financials group service revenue, 1.5% growth despite the headwinds that Nick will talk about. But most importantly, I want to draw your attention on the EBITDA growth. In the second half of last year, the margin expanded by 170 basis points, which I think is quite remarkable. And with that, I will hand over to Nick to talk about the overall financials. Nick Read Thank you. Thank you, Vittorio. Good morning, everyone. So our strategic moves to further strengthen our India and Netherlands business over the course of this year has resulted in an unusually complex set of results, so I will try to simplify the picture. All the numbers in our statutory report and as per the press release this morning now exclude India following the merger announcement with Idea. However, from an operational perspective, there is no change. The group remains highly focused on the management of the business both prior to completion and thereafter. With that said, moving to the first chart. To aid comparability with future reporting, this slide shows our results for the year both including and excluding the Netherlands. This year, our performance clearly demonstrates that we are achieving significant operational leverage, which is starting to positively impact our EBIT and our return on capital. On the left, organic service revenue grew 1.9% year-on-year and was broadly consistent across H1 and H2 as expected. In the middle, thanks to our Fit for Growth program, we grew adjusted EBITDA faster than service revenue, up 5.8%, accelerating through the year, significantly improving on last year\'s growth of 2.3%. On a guidance basis which includes both India and the Netherlands for the full year, EBITDA was up 3.4% to 15.8 billion. Turning to the chart on the right. To ensure the appropriate internal focus on return on capital, we have changed our annual bonus criteria for FY \'18 from EBITDA to EBIT across the group. In this context, I\'m very pleased to be able to report an inflection in adjusted EBIT during the fiscal year with acceleration of 12% organic growth in H2. Going forward, we expect our EBITDA growth to continue to outpace the increase in our D&A expenses, lifting our EBIT margins and our return on capital. Our reporting loss for the year was 6.1 billion, which reflects three large noncash exceptional items that are excluded from our adjusted earnings per share calculation highlighted on this chart. Let me focus on India. You will remember, at the half year, we booked a net 5 billion noncash impairment charge for our Indian business as a result of increased competition in the marketplace. Following the merger announcement with Idea, we have revised our fair value of the business and have written back 1.3 billion of the impairment in the second half. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS grew 17%, which includes the dilution of shares due to the issuance of mandatory convertible bonds at the end of the prior year. Due to -- as communicated previously, these bonds are aligned to our Verizon loan notes. And we are able to use the proceeds from the notes to buy back these bonds as they mature, avoiding dilution to our shareholders. Our effective tax rate this year was 25.4%, excluding India, consistent with our unchanged medium term guidance at a mid 20s tax rate. So turning to service revenue. As the chart on the left shows, our top line performance has broadly been consistent throughout the year. You will remember that, a year ago, we called out some exceptional items that delivered a strong Q4 in FY \'16, which are listed at the bottom of the slide. Together with a full quarter impacts of the large MTR cut in Germany, the combined impacts of all of these was roughly 80 basis points on a quarter over quarter basis, so the true underlying Q4 performance was consistent with the previous quarters. So solid momentum into FY \'18. However, as the chart on the right shows, we will now face the final year of EU regulation on roaming, which is a drag worth 300 million. This impact, together with the ongoing effect of the German MTR cut, is expected to weigh on our revenue growth by around one percentage point compared to last year. Turning to our three key strategic growth drivers, which Vittorio will cover in more detail later: mobile data, convergence and enterprise. In aggregate, these allowed us to gain profitable total comms revenue market share in most of our major markets. Excluding the regulatory drags I just described, our European consumer mobile business is now back to modest growth, reflecting the contribution from our more for more commercial actions. Emerging market growth, largely driven by data, continues to be a key contributor, reflecting the excellent performance across the footprint. And momentum in convergence remained strong, with base growth of over 1.5 million customers during the year supporting revenue market share gains in fixed and TV. And in enterprise, we continued to outperform our international peers, reflecting gains in fixed and continued momentum with multinational corporates, along with good growth in AMAP. As you see on the right of this chart, these healthy performances are partially offset by the EU roaming MTR regulation; and by our strategic decision to exit some highly volatile, low-margin wholesale carrier contracts, which represents about half of the drag you see highlighted on the chart, along with the decline in MVNOs of around 60 million. Now moving to our cost base. We sustained our commercial momentum over the year with strong customer growth and structurally lower churn, as demonstrated at the top of the chart. However, our operating expenses declined in absolute terms during the year, reflecting the impacts of our Fit for Growth initiatives. Our gross margin contribution represented just over half of our EBITDA growth in the year whilst facing a drag of approximately 200 million of increased content costs, principally in Spain and Portugal. The remainder of our EBITDA growth was driven by a net organic decline in our operating cost base of 0.3 billion. By focusing more on direct channels and the optimization of subsidy and commission models, we reduced customer costs by 0.2 billion. We were able to hold our technology costs flat, absorbing incremental pressure from Project Spring of about 200 million, excluding India. Finally, we further reduced our support costs by 0.1 billion despite inflationary pressures in AMAP given our 0-based budgeting approach. So on an underlying basis, our operating costs you see highlighted in the box declined 0.5 billion, adjusted for Project Spring, a result significantly helped by the final run rate delivery of KDG and Ono synergies. Our Fit for Growth progress underpins the guidance we\'re giving today for a further net reduction in organic operating costs during the coming fiscal year. Rather than go through the drivers again which are outlined on the left-hand side, I\'d like to focus more on a key enabler we are rolling out to structure our approach to margin optimization and cost efficiency, which we believe will play a key role in delivering our margin expansion targets. Currently under development using a single global instance of SAP, combined with our data warehouse and data analytics tools, we are able to determine the profitability of our business at a micro level, moving beyond the flawed focus on averages to the drivers of cost and profitability at an individual customer level. As you see on the right, our customer profitability analytics platform will give us multiple views of profitability given the [hold] of data at customer level. We are now rolling out this platform across our markets and see substantial opportunity for margin improvement as we gain a richer and deeper understanding of the profitability of our business. With healthier top line growth and a declining cost base, our margin expansion has accelerated this year. During FY \'12, \'15, we were struggling to grow margins given the structural pressures on the industry. Only 6 markets improved margins in this period, collectively representing around 21% of the group\'s EBITDA. Following our investment in Project Spring, convergence and customer excellence, combined with Fit for Growth focus, we are seeing the results. In the past year, 15 out of our 22 controlled operations have improved their margins, representing over 80% of the EBITDA. Looking at our EBITDA performance on a market-by-market basis. There are some very strong results in the year. Italy was the stand-out performer, expanding margins by 300 basis points and growing EBITDA over 10% year-over-year. I consider this a great example of our Vodafone model, best network, more-for-more proposition, convergence drives whilst reshaping channel economics and Fit for Growth delivery and absolute decline in costs, all achieved in a highly competitive market. Spain achieved a 210 basis points expansion in margins, growing EBITDA by 9%. Effectively, a reduction in handset subsidies, with absolute cost declines, more than offset the step-up in content costs. I was also pleased with the progress on costs in Germany, which helped to accelerate H2 EBITDA and deliver a 150 basis points improvement in margins over the year. The U.K. is the clear underperformer on margins, which I will address in my next slide. In AMAP, we continued to achieve excellent growth and margin expansion in Turkey and Egypt despite cost inflation. And South Africa had a very strong performance, thank you, Peter, with EBITDA margin reaching 42.7% for the year. In India, it\'s worth noting that, since Jio has announced charging, we have seen a stabilization in a number of our commercial metrics such as prepaid recharges, but clearly the situation remains fluid. Moving to the U.K. Vittorio has already commented on the commercial and operational actions taken on the left of this slide, so let me focus on the financial performance on the right. The top chart shows that in sterling terms our service revenue remained stable over the last four quarters. Q4 revenue last year benefited from a one-off capacity sale in carrier services, which we highlighted last year, with a strong comp in enterprise. Therefore, the real underlying service revenue this quarter decreased by around 3%, which is similar to last quarter. Our results for April have been consistent with this underlying performance. The reported EBITDA decline was material, but this reflects a number of unusual items. Excluding these items, the EBITDA declined by approximately 7% this year. Given our commercial and operational results, we expect evident financial progress by H2 and have agreed a plan for margin recovery over the targeted three-year long-range plan. Moving to CapEx. Our CapEx as a percent of service revenues was 16% this year, at the top end of our mid-teens range, as expected. We remain confident that this level of investment will allow us to meet our growth objectives and maintain network leadership. This slide is focused on how we allocate our CapEx across the business to support our strategic objectives. The chart shows the mix of spending across our top 5 markets, which make up about 65% of our local CapEx spend. Just under 50% of our CapEx was spent on ensuring a stable, high-quality experience for our customers in a world where data is growing at approximately 60%. Therefore, 50% is spent on growing and developing our business. We spent 20% on adding mobile capability, 4G+ coverage et cetera. 8% was spent on fixed. Vittorio will shortly talk about the infrastructure strategy; and the trade-offs between buy, build and rent options. And as previously stated, the mid-teens outlook has limited fiber build. We continuously evaluate fiber business cases, but we have yet to identify opportunities with the appropriate targeted returns. We will continue to explore these options and will bring forward on a case-by-case basis if compelling returns can be achieved. IT transformation remains a key priority as we build new digital capabilities that deliver a customer experience at low cost. Again, Vittorio will describe these shortly. And finally, 14% or 2.2 percentage points of our capital intensity is directly linked to our commercial success and revenue generation. The other critical item of our capital expenditure is spectrum. India has driven the majority of our spectrums cost over the past few years, but as you can see from the chart, excluding India and Netherlands, our cash spending on spectrum has averaged 1.2 billion since 2010, a period where we secured our 4G spectrum. FY \'16 was high given an exceptional 4G auction in Germany, our largest market. Our spectrum amortization charge over the last four years has risen to around 1.8 billion, but it\'s important to remember that this includes the excessively expensive 3G auctions in Germany, U.K., Italy. If we paid 4G prices for this spectrum, our normalized spectrum amortization charge would move below the cash spectrum average. Predicting spectrum costs in an individual year is challenging, obviously. However, over the coming three years, we do not expect a major change in our overall average spectrum investment levels. The tapering in growth of D&A resulting from our normalized capital intensity and less-volatile spectrum creates the opportunity for EBITDA expansion to deliver strong EBIT growth, as we saw in H2. Turning to free cash flow, which increased by 2.8 billion this year as Project Spring came to an end. As previously highlighted, we saw a large outflow of capital creditors, reflecting the timing of the final Project Spring payments, which fell in H1. Cash interest expenses declined 830 million, thanks to our effective treasury management. Given our strategic decision to shift from floating to fixed in the summer, we have now locked in a cash interest rate of around 2.5% for at least the next five years, limiting our exposure to a rise in interest rates. Our cash tax performance in the year was a little bit better than expected given a number of favorable settlements. In FY \'18, we expect to pay around 1 billion in cash taxes. We also saw rising dividends from our joint ventures and associate investments. These businesses have strong market positions. And over time, we believe they will be worth far more than the current dividend streams the loans suggest. We expect to receive substantial dividends from VodafoneZiggo in the future, noting last week the JV guided a total cash return to its parents of at least 500 million during calendar 2017. Let me take the opportunity to briefly cover VodafoneZiggo, which experienced a tough quarter in a highly competitive market. We expect top line pressure to increase this year given the impact of back book re-pricing, roaming and our investment decision to drive convergence into the base. However, we are focused on accelerating the significant synergies we believe the JV is well placed to deliver, significant long term value. Moving from free cash flow to dividends. Clearly, the right and only way to think about dividend cover is on a post spectrum basis. On this basis, excluding India, as the chart on the left shows, we almost covered the dividend during FY \'17. Turning to the chart on the right. Our three year long term management incentive plan has been set on a new group moving forward, which excludes India. However, it is important to note that our annual incentive continues to include India, which is appropriate given we expect to have full control of the business for much or all of the coming fiscal year. Despite the absence of India, which was previously expected to contribute to our free cash flow in the outer years, the midpoint of the three year free cash flow target has modestly increased to 16.6 billion versus a 16.3 billion previously. If we took the average cash spectrum cost of 1.2 billion per the year I previously covered and assumed the next three years were in line with this average, you can see the dividend is fully covered at target. Ultimately, the board understands the importance of the dividend and have the intention to increase the dividend per share annually. Moving to net debt. The chart shows the bridge from March \'16 to March \'17, all of which are well known items, with the exception of India capital injection. Clearly, given India is excluded from the group results, the capital injection which was pay -- to pay spectrum appears as an outflow. Excluding India, net debt at the end of the year was 31.2 billion. And at 2.2 times net debt to EBITDA, it sits in the middle of the targeted 2 times to 2.5 times range. Including the debt at Vodafone India, net debt was 39.8 billion. We expect to contribute a vast majority of Vodafone India\'s net debt into the merged entity at closing, subject to the usual closing adjustments. So finally, looking ahead to guidance for the fiscal year, starting with our baseline of 13.5 billion. On an organic basis, we expect to grow by 4% to 8% from this level, which is equivalent to a range of 14 billion to 14.5 billion. To achieve this growth, as previously discussed, we will have to absorb 300 million of roaming headwinds. However, this will be offset by the EBITDA benefit of approximately 300 million flowing from the introduction of handset financing in the U.K., which moves us in line with market practice as we did in Spain. Note that this benefit does not flow to free cash flow, as it\'s effectively reversed in working capital and will have a drag on service revenues of 130 million. When considering the guidance range, the key swing factor in the year is clearly Italy. The other factors are the usual ones: competitive intensity in all our major markets; and macroeconomic, political instability. Our free cash flow guidance of around 5 billion assumes that we remain towards the upper end of our mid-teens envelope on capital expenditure. Clearly, maintaining this strong momentum requires a clear strategy and robust execution, which brings me neatly back to Vodafone 2020 and Vittorio. Vittorio Colao Great. So let\'s talk about our strategy going forward. First of all, let\'s see what is Vodafone today and start from after -- transactions after Spring. If you look at Vodafone today, you really think of three things. One is Europe. Europe is now three quarters of the total. There is 0.6% growth, which is a combination of a healthy and positive 3.5 on fixed line and again broadband 1.2 million in the year, convergence. I will talk about these things. And mobile, slightly negative in the year because of the impact of MTR, roaming and other accounting changes. But as I said, growth in EBITDA, 100 basis points in the year. So this is three quarters of Vodafone. One quarter is AMAP ex India. Good growth, 7.7% growth; 150 basis points growth in EBITDA margin; and I would say, the classic sustained momentum of mobile customer growth and usage growth. Then the last part is India, where actually we had 220 basis points reduction in EBITDA. And as Nick has said and [certainly I said], the Jio impact will be seen for a few more quarters, but as you know, we have taken action there. Throughout the piece, we have improved in the year our asset composition in the Netherlands with the joint venture with Ziggo. Now we have a leading essentially competitor at par with the main operator, KPN, there. Nick has said there is some pressure in consumer, some pressure in SoHo, but if you think that we only have 25% of the Ziggo homes having mobile, again the opportunity there is more in the convergence direction. We announced yesterday that Vodacom and Safaricom simplification. And this has clearly a dual purpose: on one hand, as I said, simplify, but also to be sure that the two excellence points that we have in Africa, the excellence of Safaricom financial inclusion, a great management of marketing presence and the excellence of Vodacom which is more multi-country management and, of course, detailed analytics and CVM go together to exploit opportunities in a more organized way across Africa. And finally, the merger with Idea, which is essentially 40% market share, 1400 megahertz of spectrum and 10 billion of synergies and becoming a champion of Digital India. So this is what is Vodafone today, three quarters, one quarter and the big joint venture in the fastest and biggest market in the world. In terms of strategy, just a reminder, this is not a slide that you have already seen. This the latest slide coming out of our board strategy review, but most of it should be familiar to you. And that -- it has the beauty that we put everything in one slide and now the whole of Vodafone can stay strategic and stay in one slide. This is Vodafone 2020. The left part, number one, is what you know. It\'s the core communication strategy. I will cover it later, but essentially it\'s about being number one, number two in customer experience and network delivery. The second is, let me call it, the seeds for the future. Somebody calls it the -- more the Vodafone 2025 strategy, but you need to put the seeds now. And it\'s new digital businesses. I will cover them briefly. And the third one, I will not cover because it\'s, I think, fairly known stuff that we debated a lot, but it\'s really about technology and cost excellence, move from 4G to 4G+ to 4.5G. Fiberization, there was a lot of concern about fiberization. Today, we have 95%, sorry. Our target is to get to 95% of urban sites fiberized. We are already at 70%, so we are going in that direction. Cloudification, virtualization, if any of you have questions, Johan is here in the room and can tell you about our technology problems that I have to say I am more and more comfortable with. The more I see us and [I ask] vendors where we are, the more confident I am that we are going in the right direction. Fit for Growth, under Nick\'s leadership and Margherita\'s, which you see as well, if you want, you can ask her as well, is getting into Phase 2 and as you have seen is starting to deliver. And then our digital first program is something new. We have not announced it yet. We just mentioned it today. It\'s really the new wave of investments to essentially improve the customer experience but also reduce dramatically costs. This is about machine learning and robotics. It\'s about online, and it\'s about billing transformation that Nick mentioned. This, I will not cover in the rest. All of these enabled by the commercial platform CARE. Serpil Timuray could not be here today, but we have Brian from enterprise. It\'s the way we will deliver through connectivity, good offers, rewarding loyalty and easy access; and then the way we organize, which I will use, which I\'ll dedicate one word to at the end of this presentation. But essentially, it\'s three business pillars: one, delivery, commercial delivery mechanism, one; organization; and cultural element. So let\'s review how the core communication is going. I am pleased. We are increasing the gap versus our competitors in NPS in consumer, a little bit against both the next best and the second next best, as you can see on the left part of the chart. And we lead in 19 out of 21 markets, but also, in enterprise we have, we are maintaining an 8-point lead and we are leading in 15 out of 20 markets. So the strategy seems to be working, at least based on what the customers are telling us. And what really makes me proud is the right part of the chart, and here there\'s three key numbers. We are improving our NPS position in 16 markets, the one above the horizontal line. We are leading in 19 markets, the one to the right of the vertical line. And yes, we have more work to do in the U.K. and the Netherlands, as we said, but in the U.K. we think we are on the right track. And in the Netherlands, we are now starting the integration. So from a customers\' point of view, the work done is being recognized. Now from an infrastructure point of view, again this is a mixed qualitative, quantitative chart. This says that we have 92% 4G coverage in Europe and a number that is very used in the U.S. We cover 315 million POPs, as they say, which is the vastest, the biggest coverage that you can think of. We reach 59% of homes through NGN; and 22% and 36 million, through our own NGN. Now this is an increase of 21 million in two years. 7 million is Ono. 7 million is Ziggo, and 7 million is our own build. And I will color a little bit the difference between the different phones. And this is the powerful technology platform that we have built over with Spring and with the acquisitions. We then have qualitative elements that make me also relatively confident that Vodafone is in a good shape: 0.37% drop rate, which I\'ve never seen anywhere in my life with 20-plus years in this sector; and 92% of data sessions above 3 megabit per second, which really means video quality almost everywhere. But also, as I said, fiberization is going ahead, 70%. I remember people were saying, how are you going to deal with the need for fiber? The answer is we are. And 6 million homes in Germany with more than 400 megabit per second. So I would say both from a qualitative and a quantitative point of view I think the investments that we have made in the last years have been pretty, pretty solid; and are now delivering also not just in the eyes of the customers but is also objectively a very powerful platform. So then the question is monetization. Let\'s start with mobile data, which is 1 of the 3 areas of growth. Here I will not go into the details. On commercial level, we keep doing 2 things essentially. To simplify, we have more-for-more offers, which means €2, €3, €1, €5, to give more to the customers, more or less, more data. It\'s roaming. It\'s rollover of plans is something included in this kind of expansion of ARPU. And that\'s one way of delivering. The other way is personalized offers, which is more the Italian case or the South African case, where instead of being at the headline kind of super-competitive, super-promotional level, you go one by one and will make offers of the same kind but more personalized, which of course has the advantage of improving the yield. And Nick has shown the kind of funnel with all the euros coming down. The result of this is a continued growth of data in Europe. We are now 55% growth and 1.7 gig per customer of usage. It\'s the top part of the central slide and as you can see from the lower part, stabilization or even some improvement of ARPU throughout the piece. Now the part, the chart on the right is the one I really like. It\'s the potential. So what is the potential for mobile data? Again, here we could give you very complicated numbers, but the broad message is we have 516 million customers, including joint ventures, in Vodafone. There\'s, of these, 212 million smartphones. Of these, 100 million are 4G smartphones. And of these, 75 million are 4G customers. So one way of looking at it, of course, different ARPUs, different countries, but we have an 85% 4G opportunity in our customer base, which I think is a good indicator that with a powerful network and a good capacity we can actually continue along this strategy in a successful way. Second element was convergence. Often, we are asked, okay, tell us about your strategy. This -- let me start with an explain of Spain in terms of infrastructure strategy. In Spain, we have 10.2 million homes that we cover through our own infrastructure. We have an undisclosed number that we can reach additionally through commercial agreement with Telefónica. And then we have the regulated rates, at which we can get access from Telefónica again, and this leads to 18.7 million homes. Then these homes will evolve. There\'s the ADSL coverage, which now is wholesale and over time will go into VDSL or into potentially our own build. And that gets to 96% of the homes or 27.7 million. And then there is a little bit of the country which will essentially not be covered. And this is how we look at the markets. We always look at how to balance commercial deals with regulated access with our own investment and try to reach the highest possible number in terms of economic coverage. I know this will be great. And I asked to get this by GDP and not by homes, but apparently it\'s very complicated, but essentially try to be where it makes sense with your own investments and try to leverage on shared and eventually third party access where the case is less polished. Now if I do the same thing for Europe, the same numbers are 36 million; 41 million, of course with multiple partnerships, Italy, other places; 96 million; 119 million. And the white spaces remain only 25% of marginal homes, which is that essentially we can cover already today 75% of the convergence opportunity in consumer through a variety of very efficient, I would call it, smart capital deployment strategy throughout Europe. Now what is then the next step? The next step is clearly to deploy the convergence strategy. And the first element of it is how many homes are converged already today in the Vodafone portfolio, a question that often investor ask me. And here we try to give you an organic answer. The number of homes that we have in Vodafone today, excluding enterprise, the 1.7 million at the bottom; and including Ziggo if -- is 14.9 million. Of these, 4.3 million, the little pink bubble there, are converged. So 25% of the Vodafone homes have already a Vodafone mobile in their own -- in their household. Then you get to the other question, which is, But how many SIMs? How many mobile customers actually are into homes? And here I need you to follow with patience because there are a couple of complexities. So first of all, starting from the top of the pyramid, these 4 million homes have 8 million SIMs, so it\'s a ratio of two. And these are fully converged homes, so these are integrated packages. Then you go down one level, and there are homes where we are in both in fixed and in mobile but in less integrated level. These, you have two, the number on the left; and 3 million SIMs. So this makes the total 6 and 11, and this gives the answer to the question how many SIMs are in converged homes. And the answer is 17%. This excludes Eastern Europe, for simplicity of the garment. And here clearly the opportunity is to upgrade them, so link the fixed and the mobile and bring them one floor up. Then you\'ll go one level below. And we have 9 million homes where we have 53 -- sorry, 9 million homes where we don\'t have SIMs and 53 million SIMs which are not in Vodafone homes. And here the job is clearly cross sell and bring them up. And then of course, you go one level below, and there\'s the homes where we don\'t have Vodafone and the SIMs where we don\'t have Vodafone, and that\'s an acquisition market. So if you look at the overall picture, we are already between 40 and -- 20% and 40%, more or less, converged, whether we look at mobile or fixed. And there is a clear work to bring up the numbers. This is, I think, a good start of our convergence strategy. With the platforms that I described before, we are confident that these numbers can improve overtime. Now TV is, of course, part of this story. Why TV is important is simply because it makes the converged offer more appealing. And it also has a positive benefit on churn. In Spain we do 27%, 13%, 7%; so 27% churn, single mobile; 13% when you add fixed; and 6% or 7% when you add TV. So clearly, TV has a kind of gluing effect, which is positive. In TV we have now seven markets active. We have a Vodafone TV platform which is the nascent platform with, I will say, a very good performance. We are very happy about it. It\'s cloud based. It\'s multiscreen. It\'s multi feeds. It\'s on demand and leaner. So it is the most modern platform. We are going to leverage on it to launch. And it\'s available to all of our markets, to basically launch on marginal markets at a lower cost because we share the platform. I often get the question, "What\'s the Vodafone distribution strategy?" I can only repeat that we do want to have premium content because premium content is important in our offer. We -- if we can, we\'d like not to get it exclusive because we don\'t believe that exclusivity in the long run creates a lot of value for telcos. But if we need to bid for exclusivity in order to get it, we will, as we have done in a couple of market. GigaTV in Germany is the latest deployment of this strategy. And again, it has all the content, all the premium content; and it is very advanced from a technology point of view. Then finally, the third element of our core strategy, enterprise. Again, if you have questions later, Brian Humphrey (sic) [Brian Humphries], you don\'t know him; raise your hand, Brian, is here in the room. He is the new [CEO] who joined a few months ago. Enterprise is doing well. It\'s now 30% of group service revenue. And 30% of these revenues are coming from fixed. As you can see, the growth, middle bar, is 2.3%. This is a combination of 1.5% on mobile, 4.5% on fixed. The 1.5% in mobile is again coming from pressure on ARPU but growth in customers, so we are sustaining well the pressure in the enterprise segment from a pricing point of view having a good growth. And fixed, as you see, we have three lines of businesses, IP-VPN, Cloud and Hosting and IoT, which are growing double digits. So enterprise continues to be an area of growth; an area that I want to keep it as profitable, disciplined growth, but clearly we have an opportunity because we are sub, I will say, 30% market share. So we can grow there, continue to grow there very well. Now one word on the new digital businesses, which again somebody talks about the \'25 strategy. First of all, it\'s three main areas. There is more, but I will say these are the three main areas. First one is enterprise IoT. We launched many years ago, in 2007, when nobody was talking about IoT. It\'s about smart metering, automotive, logistics. This is now available in 17 markets. The reason why I mention it is because recently I was in Barcelona, at the Mobile World Congress, among CEOs and people who are supposed to be experts of the industry, and they mentioned that Vodafone have 700 -- more than 700 million of revenues in this area. And they were surprised, around the table. Nobody believed that it was possible. Now the reason why nobody believed is because the total market in the world is considered to be 6 billion. So it means that, even not being in certain big markets, we have a 12% market share. It\'s growing nicely. The reason why I mention it today is because this is a market which is supposed -- estimated to go up to more than -- 20 billion, 22 billion by 2025. So the growth opportunity having a leadership position in enterprise IoT is very important. The second area is data analytics. Now data analytics, we launched in 2015. For the time being, it\'s inward focused, so we are not selling to third parties, but it\'s already active in 14 markets. We have more than 300 data -- sorry. We will have more than 300 data scientists operating in 14 markets. And it\'s the engine and intelligence behind things like Play Every Day, again, in South Africa. South Africa is one of the kind of high points of this. But also in Turkey, where we have digital money, but also in Italy, also in other places. Now the reason why I mention it today, last year, this overall engine produced more than 3 billion offers to customers. And that does not mean 3 billion accepted offers, but we produce two, three offers per customer in order to get them accepted. It\'s a huge machine. And it\'s behind, I think, the secret and the profitability and the success of places like South Africa or Italy or Egypt. And it will be more and more, as Nick has said, our approach to marketing because that\'s the way we can profitably grow in the data environment. Third one, on the right, is the new baby. The new baby was launched this year. It\'s really consumer IoT. It\'s smaller kind of vehicles tracking, consumer devices, family trackers, home security, this type of more consumer-ish type of applications. Here we cannot talk about money numbers because it\'s very difficult to even estimate what -- how big this thing could be, but the real thing is that the number of objects that are forecasted to be connected goes in the hundreds of millions very soon. Now not all of them will be profitable. Not all of them will be realized, but again we think this is a great opportunity. It is about 100 people that will be working on this. So final slide before concluding. I\'m often asked, How do you manage this group. How do you face the external environment, the social and political, the kind of business challenges of the macro world? And the answer is essentially in this chart. Today, we are 23. Tomorrow, we\'ll be 22 controlled companies. And we have three, and we will be four, joint ventures and associates. A few years ago, we moved to the current model, which we call in the Vodafone way kind of jargon one company, local roots, which we think is particularly appropriate in this historical moment, in this historical social, political moment. This is really about having very, very strong shared single-company platforms, where it does really make the difference. And this could be hard things like procurement or enterprise or technology architecture, shared services where we have now a lot of capability but also softer things like HR and management, compliance, to be sure that the company is properly run, and brand architecture, which actually if you think about it, this is the reason why we have 48 partner markets, companies of every size who want to be part of our way of running the business. And this is what deliver the scale benefits, but then we always said -- I always said I want to have local roots. Local roots means local commercial execution; local community and political engagement, which is very important in the current world; and local communication; and local social responsibility. So we are very convinced that this model is the model that has explained the success in places so diverse like Africa or Europe or convergence, non-convergence or the Middle East versus Pacific; and will continue to be the basic setup that will enable the implementation of Vodafone 2020. So to summarize, I would say strong strategic progress; good transactions to increase the value of the portfolio; sustained revenue growth; and I\'m really happy, margin expansion and cost reduction to support cash flow and dividends, which is intention of the board. Outlook for \'17, \'18, this is labeled outlook. In the original version, it was Vittorio\'s objectives. Vittorio\'s objectives for \'17, \'18 are really NPS leadership. I have really the ambition to be at the top of the market, to gain profitable revenue market share in total communication with our three engines of growth and to deliver the guidance that Nick has illustrated of 4 to 8 percentage points of growth in EBITDA and € 5 billion of cash flow to support the dividend intentions of the board. I thank you for your attention. And now I think Nick and I will move to questions. Question-and-Answer Session A - Vittorio Colao Let\'s start with James, and then we go this way with Polo. And then we come back, Maurice and all the others. James? James Ratzer Two questions, please. The first one, on India, your new joint venture partner Idea has talked about the ideas that we could assume the bottom in the last quarter in terms of revenue trends and things can start to sequentially improve from here, was wondering if you\'ll assume the same trend in your own business looking ahead for this year. And secondly, looking kind of longer term in your European businesses, we\'re seeing an increasing number of moves to unlimited data offerings in Europe, so I\'d be interested to get your kind of thoughts on how the industry progresses on that front. Does that potentially curtail the ability to monetize data in the medium to longer term? Nick Read I\'ll do the first. Vittorio Colao Yes, you do the first. It\'s about guidance. You better do it first. Nick Read Yes. I mean, in terms of India, as I sort of highlighted, when you look at sort of March performance versus January and you do it by segment basis, what we\'re really seeing is, since Jio announced their charging, we\'ve seen a stability in total recharge values. We\'re also seeing a stability in high-value customers; medium-value customers, slight uptick, if anything; low-value customers, the same but more about ARPU capture as the market consolidates on SIMs. So I think it\'s a bit early to call the bottom of the market given it remains fragile. And Jio could always determine a new promotion, but what I\'d say is that we\'re starting to see a stabilization on the important metrics going forward. And of course, the key date is September because that\'s when Jio entered the market. So we\'ll start annualizing, and that\'s when you should start to see some improvements on the year-over-year performances. Vittorio Colao On the European question, let me say this. First of all, there is a difference between worry free and free. We like worry free because worry free is what liberates usage and what allows customers actually to appreciate the quality of the networks. Free is a little bit less of a good concept, at least in our view. And in the market, you see a wide variety of things. There\'s free content added to high-end packages. There is a kind of unlimited, which is really unlimited up to 5, 6, 7 gig and then it\'s constrained or choked in some support. In general we are more for the worry free rather than the free. And we will take actions and do commercial actions to liberate usage but in exchange of some monetization. I think that in unlimited unrestricted is actually not a great thing for the industry and which is why we will be more segmented, more focused. And then engines like the CVM and data analytics engines that we have now in our -- all of our offers. And again, South Africa was a great example. It will be crucial to be able to deliver the right offer to each customer without going into mass unlimited, generalized. Nick? Yes. Matt? Nick Delfas So Nick Delfas from Redburn. Just going on Slide 22, I understand that\'s your incentive for \'18, \'19 and \'20. And I guess it implies at least 10% growth at the average in free cash flow in \'19 and \'20 from the -- sorry, from -- yes, from the \'17 base. But can you just talk about what happened to the equivalent chart from last year? So is that adjusted for deconsolidation of India? So just if you can talk a little bit about the incentive scheme. And then the second question is just on enterprise. How come you are still growing in enterprise mobile given all the bring your own device trends, roaming etcetera? So if you could clarify it a little bit, what\'s going on there? Thanks. Nick Read Yes. So let me take the incentive, the moving parts on the incentives. See it as India is coming out. Obviously, India was going to be contributing in the outer years in terms of free cash flow. Obviously, today, it doesn\'t really generate free cash flow. However, you\'ve also got a bit of FX movement. And then essentially you\'ve got the 0.7 billion working capital Project Spring drag of FY \'17 effectively coming out of the numbers when you start to think about FY \'18 onwards. So that\'s like the positive factor on top of the growth of the business. Nick Delfas And in terms of how you\'re rewarded from the equivalent chart from last year, so just that we understand how this works. So... Nick Read So on the previous one, we stay with India performance within the plan, yes. So up until the year that India the completion happens, in the year the completion happens, we just put in what the target was for India in that one year, but all the ones leading up to completion, the actual performance is in there. So bottom line, management will be hit by, if this is what you\'re looking for, the Jio impact into the market. Vittorio Colao We make it easier for ourselves. Let me put it in a simple way. And [indiscernible] would never allow us, anyhow. So on the enterprise thing, again I encourage you to talk to Brian, who is in the thing, but the high level answer is, first of all, the bring your own device thing, which is visible in some large banks, is not a generalized thing in the market. There are some institutions that are going into bring your own device, you pay for it; others that don\'t. We have a lot of additional services that we give, especially in the area of security, device management and other stuff, which is -- are considered important by a number of customers. And don\'t forget that we have more and more integrated fixed and mobile offers, which are now a large majority, especially the -- at the higher end, where this thing of bring your own device doesn\'t really play.  Having said that, Brian has developed something that he will talk about, if you want, later in the individual sessions called BYOX, which is a very flexible offer that you give to large companies that want to go more into the bring your own device thing but still want to retain control of the service component. And so we have also adapted our offers to take into consideration that mean. Now having said that, probably we are also good in enterprise, so we\'ll continue to grow because of that. Yes, I think you had a question, yes, Andrew? And then -- yes. Andrew Beale It\'s Andrew Beale from Arete. I just wanted to come back to the incentives and just to understand. I guess you\'ve got the short term incentive, which you mentioned was EBIT. Is it exclusively EBIT in terms of the one year? Or can you just give us the weightings of those? And then the rest is the three year cash flow incentive. Is that correct? Nick Read Yes. So see, the annual incentive, the short term incentive is 20% service revenue, 20% EBIT, 20% free cash flow. So the 20% that was on EBITDA has gone to EBIT. And then 40% is customer appreciation, which was a lot of the things that Vittorio was presenting. On the long-term incentive plan, it\'s free cash flow. Andrew Beale Okay, thank you. And then just in terms of the EBITDA guidance. I guess your exit run rate was 6.2% growth in the second half. And you obviously had the 300 benefit from handset financing that you gave, 300 offset from roaming, but you also had some drags in the previous year for content and so on. Are there any other moving parts that we should be thinking about? Or is it you\'re coming in at six and you\'re really guiding to six and the other two -- the other things equals the -- equal each other out? Nick Read Yes, look, I mean we\'re a large group. And of course, there are a lot of moving parts. And I think we are pretty transparent on anything material that happens in the group. So you\'re calling out a number. I could talk about content. I could call out synergies various other things bring. What I would say broadly is, yes, we\'re in a four to eight, midpoint being six, at that level. Yes, it does include U.K. handset financing, but it also includes a lot larger impact in terms of EU regulation impacts onto our results as well. So broadly speaking, I\'d say our underlying performance is in line with the range. Vittorio Colao David, yes? David Wright Thank you. It\'s David Wright from Bank of America. Two questions, please. Just on the wider balance sheet, you\'ve shown that the gearing comes down with the Indian deal, obviously assuming completion, from 2.6 times down to 2.2, give or take. The Indus transaction, and maybe an update on that, please, will bring you down to pretty well 2.0, thereabouts. With a 2.5% cost of debt, it feels somewhat underleveraged in this environment. Your -- obviously, your free cash flow is starting to cover your dividend, thereabouts this year or so, maybe a year after. So what is the plan for that balance sheet, as it were? And you mentioned briefly, I think, you analyze fiber projects one market that does stand out where you maybe are on the scale in fixed line ownership, as Germany. Could there be an opportunity to maybe even consider a fiber build plan in Germany co-led with Deutsche or et cetera? And then maybe a second, quick question, if I could, just on Italy. You flagged that as being one of your stand-out markets for cost cutting. I think a lot of the benefit, though, came with the 28-day billing both for mobile and fixed that laps H2, but could you talk a little about how you\'re thinking about the Iliad entry? Obviously, TI is quite front forward this kind of mobile. What you guys are thinking, thank you. Vittorio Colao Yes, let me take the whole of it because I don\'t want Nick to get into complicated gearing ratios. First of all, you correctly said that there are two ifs. First of all, of course, we need to complete first the main India transaction; second, update on Indus. And of course, we are in discussions. We intend to monetize that, but again how it happens and when it happens and how it interacts with the first deal is still to be seen. So we are not -- we don\'t have a time line. I don\'t have an update really to give you other than we are working flat out on both sides, the main side and the other one. The main side is progressing well. We have filed with CCI. We have filed with the stock exchange. We will do the court case. Once we have done the court, we can go to DoT, but it -- there are steps. And Indus, of course, requires talking to our two partners, the Idea one but also Bharti, because there is an interaction with what they do; and that we are again flat out on that as well. Once those things happen, we will make a judgment. And again, you mentioned fiber in Germany. We could mention a lot of other things. We will look at whether we have good investment cases, which is so far we haven\'t seen. We will look at them, and if they make sense, we will invest in them. We will look at different type of gearing and different type of shareholder remunerations, but it\'s a bit early now because neither one nor the other are short term. So you and I, we\'ll see each other probably again before that gets unlocked. Italy, Italy and Iliad: Let me say these three things. First of all, we take Iliad very seriously, so we are not dismissive. And I said it from the beginning. I don\'t take the fact that distribution is difficult in Italy as a matter. I don\'t take the fact that prices are very low as a matter. As you have seen in India, people can also come at zero sometimes. What really gives me comfort that we are taking the right approach is two things. First of all, we are really building the strength of our Italian business on excellent quality of network and excellent marketing and relationship one on one with the customers. That\'s the best long-term defense of any company rather than the secondary thing. Second, we are contemplating all possible countermeasures. There is a project with a funny name that we follow and is considering all possible options, and we are preparing for all of them. And again, we will be as prepared as one can be for the coming of this new competitor. Third, it\'s also true that, if you look at the Italian market, it\'s incredibly promotional again now. There are offers below the line that are really rock-bottom. And therefore, it is also true that the space which is left is not huge, but we are taking it very seriously. Yes, shall we move here, Simon, yes? Maurice and [indiscernible]. Simon Weeden [indiscernible] on the U.K.... Nick Read Sorry. Simon, can you just press [indiscernible]? Simon Weeden It went red. It was very encouraging. Okay, that\'s better. Simon Weeden from Citi. I was, my first question was on the U.K. And your comments seem to be that, the second half of the coming financial -- the current financial year, will see an improvement in trends. And I wondered if you could give us any color around how bad the first half could be given that, in that context; and also whether you\'re taking into account any deemed consent rebase and how much that might be. And that was one question. The second question is just around 4.5G and 5G and what you see as being the most urgent contributors from a commercial point of view from the pipeline of new technological features that those provide and what we might see coming first and what the customer demand is, how you\'re framing your thoughts about that. Nick Read I\'d just do the U.K.. So what I would say is, I think as Vittorio clearly covered in his presentation, we really do see tangible clear results in terms of network and customer operations, so we are performing strongly in those areas, and therefore, that\'s given us a lot more confidence in terms, and visibility in terms of commercial momentum, which, again, we had a very good fixed net additions. Mobile net additions look low, but as because you talked Mobile is dragging on those net adds by about, I don\'t know, from memory, 25,000, something around there. So ultimately, there is good progression, which means that H1 will show some progress. It\'s just really the type of progress we\'re looking for will be more evident in H2. No, that\'s not a factor in our consideration if they... Vittorio Colao Yes. Evolution to 4G+, 5G, we see that as a continuum. We are moving. There\'s a big announcement today in Italy about 4.5G. We basically look at things with the customer\'s eyes. We are not keen to jump into technologies for the sake of them. But it\'s clear that 4.5G and then 5G will enable, at the same time, some interesting fixed wireless solutions. I\'m not saying that it will replace fiber. I\'m just saying that in certain places, certain areas, it will make sense, and also all the Internet of Things, low latency type of applications, which we are all working on. So we see this as an evolution. Johan is preparing the network. Single RAN, fiber, virtualization, all of these are investments that we will make during the Vodafone 2020 strategy, but things will be clearly ready for the development. But we are not keen on the technology. We are keen on the applications. Maurice, and then Jerry, and then Dhananjay, and then we go up there. Maybe you call them, if you will. Maurice Patrick It\'s Maurice from Barclays. I guess, a question on Germany. On Friday, you saw the announcement that Drillisch and United Internet looking to combine their operations in the markets. I mean, do you think a combination of the two, which will leave some of the low end competitions, are making more for more easier? Or do you subscribe to the view perhaps that a more -- a so strong United Internet with the MBA MVNO contract [indiscernible] become more aggressive? I guess related to that, it\'s just on wholesale revenues. Did your guidance assume much run-off of the MVNO revenues you make, I guess, at the level, but also Germany perhaps related to this? Vittorio Colao Very easy answer. I believe that, as always, everything depends on the wisdom of your competitors. So there are cases where consolidation is positive and cases where it\'s less positive. This one, I think, is positive because it will create a long-term viability for United, which otherwise was more less clear. And in general, we did increase in data. All these MVNO models are becoming -- at the end of the day, they\'re becoming difficult to support. So I think it will be positive. Of course, the wisdom is always in their behavior. And on the wholesale side we have in Germany, I think we have secured a couple of years of wholesale revenues from United Internet. And then I assume that we\'ll migrate to the new home. But that will be good because it will leave the D networks up there. And then there\'s a new home, which is a third network, which will be more wholesale and not just at the same positioning. So... Nick Read And just to be able to -- that within our long-range plan, we do assume a sharp rundown... Vittorio Colao Yes. Nick Read On the contract in the LTUs. Vittorio Colao Jerry, yes, and then Dhananjay, and then Polo, and then we go up there, yes. Vittorio Colao You keep push... Jerry Dellis It\'s Jerry Dellis from Jefferies. A question on the U.K.\'s role within the group. How important is the U.K. now there is still the sort of core group objectives of growing profitability, growing the dividend, improving returns? What dyssynergies would there be if the U.K. were to be carved out of Vodafone today? And how significant might, perhaps, the loss of competitive advantage in Global Enterprise be if the U.K. were not part of the group? And then the second question relates to your CapEx guidance. I suppose in November, the perceived range was in the order of 15% to 16%. You\'ve subsequently taken the view, perhaps, to pull back on fiber or own build in Spain. And does that therefore mean that the -- sort of the new teens guidance is more like 15% as a result of this pullback in Spain? Or are there other things that have sort of come in to take its place? Vittorio Colao Let me take the U.K. question, and Nick will give you the guidance question on CapEx. First of all, there\'s no plan currently to carve out the U.K., so your question is a very hypothetical one. I do believe that there is a good potential in the U.K. for improving their margins and go back to a level of profitability which is significantly higher than the current one. And we do have an opportunity to have a stronger commercial platform. Don\'t forget we have very high spectrum allocation, and so we can play more aggressively, which we have started doing recently in the kind of data environment. And part of the coming back in London is also linked to the fact that in London, people are starting to recognize that we have a good network with a good capacity. So there\'s no plan in the direction that you are hinting at. And in terms of how strategic, clearly, enterprise is important in the U.K. as we have a lot of the old Cable & Wireless customers with new customers. So it is an important component of the whole enterprise strategy. That\'s the simple answer. Nick Read Just on capital guide -- capital intensity guidance, as I said in the presentation, we\'ll be at the upper end. So you can assume between \'15 and \'16, there was a bit of a pullback on Spain, but I\'m not going to call it huge. And you\'ve got other factors like success based CapEx, be given our commercial momentum, that that\'s gone through and a little stronger than we had originally planned. So I would call it good CapEx. Vittorio Colao Yes. Shall we go here, Polo, Dhananjay -- sorry, Polo, whichever order. Polo Tang It\'s Polo Tang from UBS. I just have two questions. I think one of the main standouts from these results is actually cost savings. So you talked about entering the next phase in terms of the Fit for Growth program, but how much of an opportunity is left? And is there something that can be a tailwind for several years? The second question is really just coming back to Germany, but rather than the new frill segment, can you actually talk about what you\'re seeing in terms of the competitive landscape in the premium segment of German mobile? So we\'ve obviously had stream on and in terms of that initiative from T Mobile. And can you also talk about -- maybe about da response to your Big Data bundle offers? Because from memory, I think you got a 12 gig offer at EUR 33, so what\'s been the reception for that? Vittorio Colao Yes. Nick and Margherita here can be asked any question on cost. I give you my high level answer. My high level answer is that, on one hand, again, my colleagues have set up a very systematic machine to go through all the cost elements. And either by sharing or by share elimination, I think they have done a good job, but the job will continue. I personally believe that there is more they have to do on the commercial cost front just as an industry, not just as ourselves. The more you think about it, if it\'s about SIM only, it\'s about essentially three brands of devices and devices which have longer lives. The whole distribution cost that the industry carry is, I think, too high. Online, hence, our digital first program, which I will not talk about today because, otherwise, my colleagues say that I\'m violating. We will talk about it. But clearly, we\'ll have a commercial element that has to be the next wave of cost. But I would say confidence on cost. Nick? Nick Read Yes, very good. Very good. I think what\'s really exciting also is digital. Just everything. My Vodafone app, yes, digital win, shared service centers, AI, all of those things give us a multiyear opportunity structurally. Vittorio Colao I give you like a small angle. That was in Egypt, where we have our kind of machine learning unit. They showed me a human kind of interaction with our systems and the system based one. By the time the human had finished one thing, which was a change of address, the machine changed seven. So this gives you the idea of the type of opportunity that you can have if you apply better analytics and better systems to our own industry, so I think the opportunity is great. On Germany, you asked me about the premium segment. Listen, what we are seeing is Deutsche has done the stream-on offer, which you can look at it in two different ways. You can say, well, at the end of the day, it\'s a good thing because it will push the MVNOs into a more difficult space, and it can push the bottom of the market in a more difficult space. You can also say what was available before for 55 and 45 now is available for 55, 45 plus music, plus video. So it\'s not really a more for more, it\'s the same for more, so it\'s a little bit -- the way we would like to implement those things is different, but directionally, I think it\'s the right direction. Probably, the implementation could be a little bit more inclined to a more-for-more type of strategy.  If I compare our results with Deutsche\'s results, there\'s nothing to brag about, but we did better than them in the latest round, so I think we are doing something right. Our giga offers are all inclined to be at the high end and to take usage up in Germany -- usage up to 1.2 gig finally in Germany with these offers. Germans are more cautious users of data. But the vision is the same as Italy, the same as the other places, take people up in usage and try to increase loyalty, reduce churn, improve the right relationship and, eventually, give more data in exchange for this. Dhananjay? Dhananjay Mirchandani Vittorio, my question is related to your branding and commercial strategy in the context of Vodafone 2020. How sustainable is a -- is what, in my view, simplistically spoken, is a monobrand strategy in markets that are increasingly segmented and a competitive landscape -- take BT in the U.K., take Deutsche Telekom in Germany -- where you have, at a minimum, two, if not three, brands that are attempting to address a very different customer segment and needs. Vittorio Colao It is not sustainable, which why we have more brands ourselves, as simple as that. If you look at Germany, we have Otelo, and we have now Vodafone Easy, which is a sub -- it\'s not exactly a new brand, but it\'s a sub thing. In Spain, we have Lowi, which is becoming now a converged brand as well. And in Morca in The Netherlands, we have always historically had them. So there\'s a tactical/segmented user either of product brands -- sorry, Portugal, Greece, I mean, I can mention on and on and on -- of brands which are either segmented brands or discount brands which we really use. I prefer the segmented brands because they cater to a specific segment. Youth is the classic example, Vodafone U or things like that. And I prefer to have some kind of attachment to the main brand. But if needed, we can also have them separate, like we do have in several cases. Dhananjay Mirchandani Can I just very briefly follow up on that? So if you were to take your advertising costs over a five-year period, what percentage of that would you allocate to curating these second brands product or standard. Vittorio Colao Not a huge amount, Dhananjay. And this is the important point to get. Vodafone is the brand that remains a brand, like Deutsche, like Telefónica MoviStar, like everything else. We\'d use these second brands or sub-brands. It\'s, most of the times, focused on segments, and therefore, you have much more direct access, much more online, much less retail, in order to address a specific segment. The massive -- the big part of our 750 million spending still goes into Vodafone. Yes? Robert Grindle It\'s Robert Grindle from Deutsche Bank in disguise. Vittorio Colao That\'s really -- I mean, almost unrecognizable. Robert Grindle I\'m overly [compensated], what can I say. Yes, just a quick one on Nick\'s comment on the exiting of the low-margin carrier business in the U.K. Is it a case that you\'ve chosen to exit that type of business, or was there a particular contract? Would you get back into that space if the economics improved at some point in the future? And then my second question is about handset and equipment revenues. There was an even wider gap between total group revenue growth this quarter and service revenue growth. It must be handset sales. But actually, it started to narrow a bit in Europe. I wonder, is the European handset cycle improving? And of course, it\'s important for future service revenue growth as well. Nick Read So in terms of handset cycles, no, I\'ve not seen any material shifts in handset cycles, so I have to review that gap just to see if there\'s anything other that\'s skewing it. But in terms of metrics of handsets sold, no. In terms of the first question was around? Robert Grindle The carrier in the U.K. Nick Read Yes, the U.K. carrier, these are ultra-low, low margins. And our strategy is being one of we build the network for ourselves, and then we can sell capacity to third parties at a reasonable margin. If they get too low, there tends to be high volatility. And we said let\'s take the volatility out of the system. We have high growth ourselves as a company already, yes. So we chose to exit those contracts, so it\'s our choice to exit those. Could there be more some more of those next year? Yes, there could always be more of those. So see it as a bit like an airline, you\'re constantly yield managing your infrastructure for your own business first versus others. Vittorio Colao Yes. Should we go back one and then -- yes, and then Emmet. Guy Peddy It\'s Guy Peddy from Macquarie. Just want to follow up. There\'s been lots of chatter about margin in here, but I just wanted to bring it back down to the revenue line. if I look across Europe, there are some -- some operators are giving the messages that, perhaps, things are getting a little bit tougher; consumer pricing is getting a little bit tighter; the ability to absorb price increases is limiting; product innovation is falling, i.e. 4G has been around here for a long time, and giving more data isn\'t really an innovation; the fixed line side has been no major evolutions of technology, so therefore, things are getting a little bit stagnant as well. Is that something that you\'re picking up in your business that, perhaps, the overall industry is getting a little bit tougher now than, perhaps, it was 18, 24 months ago when 4G was newer, et cetera? Vittorio Colao Yes, let me give a quick answer. What I\'m picking up is that not all of the pricing moves that I see across Europe made complete sense to me. Some of them look a little bit short term and not -- don\'t factor in competitors\' reactions, which I will not say which ones. But clearly, we do like our model because in our model, all pricing moves are very seriously evaluated and very focused by segment, and that\'s why we think we are generating a good margin to this year. So do we see the same thing? Probably, yes. Do we manage it exactly in the same way? Probably not. And I hope we will be able to continue like that. Back, yes? How many do we have? Tim Boddy One, yes. Two. Vittorio Colao Last two. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Shall I go for the first? A couple of questions. The first one is on -- a follow-up on India. One of the reasons why that keeps going up this year was the € 3.6 billion equity injection in India. Now with the NewCo, you\'re going -- with the debt you confer yourself, and Idea will have a 4.5 times roughly debt to EBITDA. Because most of the towers are leased, that, that will be capitalized under full credit by the credit ratings, so it will be in excess of sixtimes. And EBITDA is going down 23% on your side, 34% on their side. They have an analogy interest rate of 10% on the debt. If I remember, that\'s what you said on the presentation of the deal. So do you reckon that is a sustainable balance sheet going forward? And what the risk that you have to keep injecting equity over the next one or two years? And this is actually a side. I\'ve seen also -- I\'ve noticed that more than 10% of your free cash flow is dividends from associates. Then you\'ve got also this shareholder recharged another 20 million, so almost 15% of your free cash flow comes from taking cash out of these associates. What\'s the gearing you have in place like Australia, Ziggo and, of course, India and Indus, of course, that for one that contributed the dividends? And the second question is on the... Vittorio Colao It\'s the third. Tim Boddy It\'s the third on a multilevel. Unidentified Analyst This one is very simple. It\'s actually a clarification of the broadband because, as you said, was many different variable but a bit convoluted. So you have 36 million NGN coverage, and a coverage on the wholesale of 83 million is the balance between the 119 million and 36 million. How many of the NGN customers connected are on the 36 million coverage? And how many on the wholesale coverage? It should be relatively simple as well. Vittorio Colao Yes. So Tim, you think the last one, please? Tim Boddy Yes, yes. Nick Read Okay, can I suggest, because rather than getting into filling the whole spreadsheet out, we do -- we cover a lot the more detailed points on the ones when afterwards. But what I would say in terms of India, I would say that currently, on the plans of the two combined businesses, there is no further need to put in capital to the business. So of the question then becomes how is trading currently versus our expectation, and we are smack in line with our trading and expectations. So as I say, it\'s really important that when Jio started charging, what happened to our commercial metrics, and basically, I\'m saying they\'ve stabilized, and therefore, we\'d gone into April results are in line with our expectation, and the same for Idea. There are a number of other aspects. Obviously, we have to dispose of towers, the orphan towers that sit within our business, their business, India\'s stake in Indus, obviously, from a leverage perspective. But currently, we feel comfortable from a go-forward basis. I suggest, all the shareholder recharges, et cetera, that our free cash flow is driven of the fact that we have operational leverage on our core business. It\'s real free cash flow generation. And our capital intensity is now normalizing going forward, which I hopefully highlighted in the presentation. And in terms of on footprint, NGN, 26% penetration on average? Unidentified Company Representative [Indiscernible] 27 million [indiscernible] Vittorio Colao Yes. Yes. Okay. One more, probably the last one, and then we can move to individual sessions with the ExCom members, which I\'ll introduce quickly. Emmet? Emmet Kelly It\'s Emmet Kelly of Morgan Stanley. On Slide 35, you talked about some of your new digital businesses... Vittorio Colao Yes. Emmet Kelly In particular, IoT and data analytics. And could you talk a little bit about the data analytics side and how you might be able to monetize that? Just read some reports which show that mobile operators have, perhaps, the best data set out there in the market in terms of Big Data. You\'ve got location based data. A lot of the data you have is real time as well. You have data on some customers going back about three or four years. You have their surf history as well. You say you\'re not selling to third parties in terms of data monetization. Can you just say what the revenue opportunity could be here at some stage in the future? Vittorio Colao Thank you, Emmet, for your question because it\'s a very easy answer for me. First of all, thank you for saying that we have one of the most interesting data sets. I am very jealous of one company that knows what we are all thinking and another company that knows what we are all buying. Those two companies also have a very interesting data set. Yes, we do have a very interesting data set, and the answer to your question is we have not, for the time being, decided to apply to third party revenues. The reason is very simple. We had to set up a centralized data analytics unit. We have to hire people in a lot of markets who are very difficult to hire and very much in demand. And we have a huge opportunity in our own business. So the initial work of this 200 and whatever, 50, 80, 60, 300 people by the end of the year is really focused on improving our economics. And there is so much we can do in our own kind of commercial manager. But even in his management view on -- in the technology, where you put sites, how much CapEx you put, where you put it, how you put it, there is so much value that we can generate. And honestly, it\'s a value that comes with the 30 and plus percent EBITDA margin. While if you sell to third parties, you have completely different type. So for the time being, these units are focused internally. By the end of this year, when we have deployed everywhere and we are 100% sure that we have the cruising speed on our own exploitment, then we\'ll start thinking about the external work. Now let me very quickly say that we would really love to interact with you on a one to one basis. Just for your information, you have -- if you\'re interested in small European countries, Ahmed is the CEO of the small countries, raise your hand; Brian is the new CEO of enterprise; Margherita, Deputy CFO on cost and everything else. Matthew Kirk and, behind him, Joakim Reiter, his successor on Regulation and all the pleasures of dealing with Brussels; Vivek, CEO of emerging markets and the expert of Safaricom, Vodacom, India and everything else; Rosemary Martin, if you\'re interested in compliance, anti bribery and legal risks; and Johan, CTO, is very well known. Thank you very much for your questions. We really look forward to a further interaction in the next 15 or 20 minutes. Thank you. Nick Read Thank you.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': "A - Vittorio Colao Let's start with James, and then we go this way with Polo. And then we come back, Maurice and all the others. James? James Ratzer Two questions, please. The first one, on India, your new joint venture partner Idea has talked about the ideas that we could assume the bottom in the last quarter in terms of revenue trends and things can start to sequentially improve from here, was wondering if you'll assume the same trend in your own business looking ahead for this year. And secondly, looking kind of longer term in your European businesses, we're seeing an increasing number of moves to unlimited data offerings in Europe, so I'd be interested to get your kind of thoughts on how the industry progresses on that front. Does that potentially curtail the ability to monetize data in the medium to longer term? Nick Read I'll do the first. Vittorio Colao Yes, you do the first. It's about guidance. You better do it first. Nick Read Yes. I mean, in terms of India, as I sort of highlighted, when you look at sort of March performance versus January and you do it by segment basis, what we're really seeing is, since Jio announced their charging, we've seen a stability in total recharge values. We're also seeing a stability in high-value customers; medium-value customers, slight uptick, if anything; low-value customers, the same but more about ARPU capture as the market consolidates on SIMs. So I think it's a bit early to call the bottom of the market given it remains fragile. And Jio could always determine a new promotion, but what I'd say is that we're starting to see a stabilization on the important metrics going forward. And of course, the key date is September because that's when Jio entered the market. So we'll start annualizing, and that's when you should start to see some improvements on the year-over-year performances. Vittorio Colao On the European question, let me say this. First of all, there is a difference between worry free and free. We like worry free because worry free is what liberates usage and what allows customers actually to appreciate the quality of the networks. Free is a little bit less of a good concept, at least in our view. And in the market, you see a wide variety of things. There's free content added to high-end packages. There is a kind of unlimited, which is really unlimited up to 5, 6, 7 gig and then it's constrained or choked in some support. In general we are more for the worry free rather than the free. And we will take actions and do commercial actions to liberate usage but in exchange of some monetization. I think that in unlimited unrestricted is actually not a great thing for the industry and which is why we will be more segmented, more focused. And then engines like the CVM and data analytics engines that we have now in our -- all of our offers. And again, South Africa was a great example. It will be crucial to be able to deliver the right offer to each customer without going into mass unlimited, generalized. Nick? Yes. Matt? Nick Delfas So Nick Delfas from Redburn. Just going on Slide 22, I understand that's your incentive for '18, '19 and '20. And I guess it implies at least 10% growth at the average in free cash flow in '19 and '20 from the -- sorry, from -- yes, from the '17 base. But can you just talk about what happened to the equivalent chart from last year? So is that adjusted for deconsolidation of India? So just if you can talk a little bit about the incentive scheme. And then the second question is just on enterprise. How come you are still growing in enterprise mobile given all the bring your own device trends, roaming etcetera? So if you could clarify it a little bit, what's going on there? Thanks. Nick Read Yes. So let me take the incentive, the moving parts on the incentives. See it as India is coming out. Obviously, India was going to be contributing in the outer years in terms of free cash flow. Obviously, today, it doesn't really generate free cash flow. However, you've also got a bit of FX movement. And then essentially you've got the 0.7 billion working capital Project Spring drag of FY '17 effectively coming out of the numbers when you start to think about FY '18 onwards. So that's like the positive factor on top of the growth of the business. Nick Delfas And in terms of how you're rewarded from the equivalent chart from last year, so just that we understand how this works. So... Nick Read So on the previous one, we stay with India performance within the plan, yes. So up until the year that India the completion happens, in the year the completion happens, we just put in what the target was for India in that one year, but all the ones leading up to completion, the actual performance is in there. So bottom line, management will be hit by, if this is what you're looking for, the Jio impact into the market. Vittorio Colao We make it easier for ourselves. Let me put it in a simple way. And [indiscernible] would never allow us, anyhow. So on the enterprise thing, again I encourage you to talk to Brian, who is in the thing, but the high level answer is, first of all, the bring your own device thing, which is visible in some large banks, is not a generalized thing in the market. There are some institutions that are going into bring your own device, you pay for it; others that don't. We have a lot of additional services that we give, especially in the area of security, device management and other stuff, which is -- are considered important by a number of customers. And don't forget that we have more and more integrated fixed and mobile offers, which are now a large majority, especially the -- at the higher end, where this thing of bring your own device doesn't really play.  Having said that, Brian has developed something that he will talk about, if you want, later in the individual sessions called BYOX, which is a very flexible offer that you give to large companies that want to go more into the bring your own device thing but still want to retain control of the service component. And so we have also adapted our offers to take into consideration that mean. Now having said that, probably we are also good in enterprise, so we'll continue to grow because of that. Yes, I think you had a question, yes, Andrew? And then -- yes. Andrew Beale It's Andrew Beale from Arete. I just wanted to come back to the incentives and just to understand. I guess you've got the short term incentive, which you mentioned was EBIT. Is it exclusively EBIT in terms of the one year? Or can you just give us the weightings of those? And then the rest is the three year cash flow incentive. Is that correct? Nick Read Yes. So see, the annual incentive, the short term incentive is 20% service revenue, 20% EBIT, 20% free cash flow. So the 20% that was on EBITDA has gone to EBIT. And then 40% is customer appreciation, which was a lot of the things that Vittorio was presenting. On the long-term incentive plan, it's free cash flow. Andrew Beale Okay, thank you. And then just in terms of the EBITDA guidance. I guess your exit run rate was 6.2% growth in the second half. And you obviously had the 300 benefit from handset financing that you gave, 300 offset from roaming, but you also had some drags in the previous year for content and so on. Are there any other moving parts that we should be thinking about? Or is it you're coming in at six and you're really guiding to six and the other two -- the other things equals the -- equal each other out? Nick Read Yes, look, I mean we're a large group. And of course, there are a lot of moving parts. And I think we are pretty transparent on anything material that happens in the group. So you're calling out a number. I could talk about content. I could call out synergies various other things bring. What I would say broadly is, yes, we're in a four to eight, midpoint being six, at that level. Yes, it does include U.K. handset financing, but it also includes a lot larger impact in terms of EU regulation impacts onto our results as well. So broadly speaking, I'd say our underlying performance is in line with the range. Vittorio Colao David, yes? David Wright Thank you. It's David Wright from Bank of America. Two questions, please. Just on the wider balance sheet, you've shown that the gearing comes down with the Indian deal, obviously assuming completion, from 2.6 times down to 2.2, give or take. The Indus transaction, and maybe an update on that, please, will bring you down to pretty well 2.0, thereabouts. With a 2.5% cost of debt, it feels somewhat underleveraged in this environment. Your -- obviously, your free cash flow is starting to cover your dividend, thereabouts this year or so, maybe a year after. So what is the plan for that balance sheet, as it were? And you mentioned briefly, I think, you analyze fiber projects one market that does stand out where you maybe are on the scale in fixed line ownership, as Germany. Could there be an opportunity to maybe even consider a fiber build plan in Germany co-led with Deutsche or et cetera? And then maybe a second, quick question, if I could, just on Italy. You flagged that as being one of your stand-out markets for cost cutting. I think a lot of the benefit, though, came with the 28-day billing both for mobile and fixed that laps H2, but could you talk a little about how you're thinking about the Iliad entry? Obviously, TI is quite front forward this kind of mobile. What you guys are thinking, thank you. Vittorio Colao Yes, let me take the whole of it because I don't want Nick to get into complicated gearing ratios. First of all, you correctly said that there are two ifs. First of all, of course, we need to complete first the main India transaction; second, update on Indus. And of course, we are in discussions. We intend to monetize that, but again how it happens and when it happens and how it interacts with the first deal is still to be seen. So we are not -- we don't have a time line. I don't have an update really to give you other than we are working flat out on both sides, the main side and the other one. The main side is progressing well. We have filed with CCI. We have filed with the stock exchange. We will do the court case. Once we have done the court, we can go to DoT, but it -- there are steps. And Indus, of course, requires talking to our two partners, the Idea one but also Bharti, because there is an interaction with what they do; and that we are again flat out on that as well. Once those things happen, we will make a judgment. And again, you mentioned fiber in Germany. We could mention a lot of other things. We will look at whether we have good investment cases, which is so far we haven't seen. We will look at them, and if they make sense, we will invest in them. We will look at different type of gearing and different type of shareholder remunerations, but it's a bit early now because neither one nor the other are short term. So you and I, we'll see each other probably again before that gets unlocked. Italy, Italy and Iliad: Let me say these three things. First of all, we take Iliad very seriously, so we are not dismissive. And I said it from the beginning. I don't take the fact that distribution is difficult in Italy as a matter. I don't take the fact that prices are very low as a matter. As you have seen in India, people can also come at zero sometimes. What really gives me comfort that we are taking the right approach is two things. First of all, we are really building the strength of our Italian business on excellent quality of network and excellent marketing and relationship one on one with the customers. That's the best long-term defense of any company rather than the secondary thing. Second, we are contemplating all possible countermeasures. There is a project with a funny name that we follow and is considering all possible options, and we are preparing for all of them. And again, we will be as prepared as one can be for the coming of this new competitor. Third, it's also true that, if you look at the Italian market, it's incredibly promotional again now. There are offers below the line that are really rock-bottom. And therefore, it is also true that the space which is left is not huge, but we are taking it very seriously. Yes, shall we move here, Simon, yes? Maurice and [indiscernible]. Simon Weeden [indiscernible] on the U.K.... Nick Read Sorry. Simon, can you just press [indiscernible]? Simon Weeden It went red. It was very encouraging. Okay, that's better. Simon Weeden from Citi. I was, my first question was on the U.K. And your comments seem to be that, the second half of the coming financial -- the current financial year, will see an improvement in trends. And I wondered if you could give us any color around how bad the first half could be given that, in that context; and also whether you're taking into account any deemed consent rebase and how much that might be. And that was one question. The second question is just around 4.5G and 5G and what you see as being the most urgent contributors from a commercial point of view from the pipeline of new technological features that those provide and what we might see coming first and what the customer demand is, how you're framing your thoughts about that. Nick Read I'd just do the U.K.. So what I would say is, I think as Vittorio clearly covered in his presentation, we really do see tangible clear results in terms of network and customer operations, so we are performing strongly in those areas, and therefore, that's given us a lot more confidence in terms, and visibility in terms of commercial momentum, which, again, we had a very good fixed net additions. Mobile net additions look low, but as because you talked Mobile is dragging on those net adds by about, I don't know, from memory, 25,000, something around there. So ultimately, there is good progression, which means that H1 will show some progress. It's just really the type of progress we're looking for will be more evident in H2. No, that's not a factor in our consideration if they... Vittorio Colao Yes. Evolution to 4G+, 5G, we see that as a continuum. We are moving. There's a big announcement today in Italy about 4.5G. We basically look at things with the customer's eyes. We are not keen to jump into technologies for the sake of them. But it's clear that 4.5G and then 5G will enable, at the same time, some interesting fixed wireless solutions. I'm not saying that it will replace fiber. I'm just saying that in certain places, certain areas, it will make sense, and also all the Internet of Things, low latency type of applications, which we are all working on. So we see this as an evolution. Johan is preparing the network. Single RAN, fiber, virtualization, all of these are investments that we will make during the Vodafone 2020 strategy, but things will be clearly ready for the development. But we are not keen on the technology. We are keen on the applications. Maurice, and then Jerry, and then Dhananjay, and then we go up there. Maybe you call them, if you will. Maurice Patrick It's Maurice from Barclays. I guess, a question on Germany. On Friday, you saw the announcement that Drillisch and United Internet looking to combine their operations in the markets. I mean, do you think a combination of the two, which will leave some of the low end competitions, are making more for more easier? Or do you subscribe to the view perhaps that a more -- a so strong United Internet with the MBA MVNO contract [indiscernible] become more aggressive? I guess related to that, it's just on wholesale revenues. Did your guidance assume much run-off of the MVNO revenues you make, I guess, at the level, but also Germany perhaps related to this? Vittorio Colao Very easy answer. I believe that, as always, everything depends on the wisdom of your competitors. So there are cases where consolidation is positive and cases where it's less positive. This one, I think, is positive because it will create a long-term viability for United, which otherwise was more less clear. And in general, we did increase in data. All these MVNO models are becoming -- at the end of the day, they're becoming difficult to support. So I think it will be positive. Of course, the wisdom is always in their behavior. And on the wholesale side we have in Germany, I think we have secured a couple of years of wholesale revenues from United Internet. And then I assume that we'll migrate to the new home. But that will be good because it will leave the D networks up there. And then there's a new home, which is a third network, which will be more wholesale and not just at the same positioning. So... Nick Read And just to be able to -- that within our long-range plan, we do assume a sharp rundown... Vittorio Colao Yes. Nick Read On the contract in the LTUs. Vittorio Colao Jerry, yes, and then Dhananjay, and then Polo, and then we go up there, yes. Vittorio Colao You keep push... Jerry Dellis It's Jerry Dellis from Jefferies. A question on the U.K.'s role within the group. How important is the U.K. now there is still the sort of core group objectives of growing profitability, growing the dividend, improving returns? What dyssynergies would there be if the U.K. were to be carved out of Vodafone today? And how significant might, perhaps, the loss of competitive advantage in Global Enterprise be if the U.K. were not part of the group? And then the second question relates to your CapEx guidance. I suppose in November, the perceived range was in the order of 15% to 16%. You've subsequently taken the view, perhaps, to pull back on fiber or own build in Spain. And does that therefore mean that the -- sort of the new teens guidance is more like 15% as a result of this pullback in Spain? Or are there other things that have sort of come in to take its place? Vittorio Colao Let me take the U.K. question, and Nick will give you the guidance question on CapEx. First of all, there's no plan currently to carve out the U.K., so your question is a very hypothetical one. I do believe that there is a good potential in the U.K. for improving their margins and go back to a level of profitability which is significantly higher than the current one. And we do have an opportunity to have a stronger commercial platform. Don't forget we have very high spectrum allocation, and so we can play more aggressively, which we have started doing recently in the kind of data environment. And part of the coming back in London is also linked to the fact that in London, people are starting to recognize that we have a good network with a good capacity. So there's no plan in the direction that you are hinting at. And in terms of how strategic, clearly, enterprise is important in the U.K. as we have a lot of the old Cable & Wireless customers with new customers. So it is an important component of the whole enterprise strategy. That's the simple answer. Nick Read Just on capital guide -- capital intensity guidance, as I said in the presentation, we'll be at the upper end. So you can assume between '15 and '16, there was a bit of a pullback on Spain, but I'm not going to call it huge. And you've got other factors like success based CapEx, be given our commercial momentum, that that's gone through and a little stronger than we had originally planned. So I would call it good CapEx. Vittorio Colao Yes. Shall we go here, Polo, Dhananjay -- sorry, Polo, whichever order. Polo Tang It's Polo Tang from UBS. I just have two questions. I think one of the main standouts from these results is actually cost savings. So you talked about entering the next phase in terms of the Fit for Growth program, but how much of an opportunity is left? And is there something that can be a tailwind for several years? The second question is really just coming back to Germany, but rather than the new frill segment, can you actually talk about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape in the premium segment of German mobile? So we've obviously had stream on and in terms of that initiative from T Mobile. And can you also talk about -- maybe about da response to your Big Data bundle offers? Because from memory, I think you got a 12 gig offer at EUR 33, so what's been the reception for that? Vittorio Colao Yes. Nick and Margherita here can be asked any question on cost. I give you my high level answer. My high level answer is that, on one hand, again, my colleagues have set up a very systematic machine to go through all the cost elements. And either by sharing or by share elimination, I think they have done a good job, but the job will continue. I personally believe that there is more they have to do on the commercial cost front just as an industry, not just as ourselves. The more you think about it, if it's about SIM only, it's about essentially three brands of devices and devices which have longer lives. The whole distribution cost that the industry carry is, I think, too high. Online, hence, our digital first program, which I will not talk about today because, otherwise, my colleagues say that I'm violating. We will talk about it. But clearly, we'll have a commercial element that has to be the next wave of cost. But I would say confidence on cost. Nick? Nick Read Yes, very good. Very good. I think what's really exciting also is digital. Just everything. My Vodafone app, yes, digital win, shared service centers, AI, all of those things give us a multiyear opportunity structurally. Vittorio Colao I give you like a small angle. That was in Egypt, where we have our kind of machine learning unit. They showed me a human kind of interaction with our systems and the system based one. By the time the human had finished one thing, which was a change of address, the machine changed seven. So this gives you the idea of the type of opportunity that you can have if you apply better analytics and better systems to our own industry, so I think the opportunity is great. On Germany, you asked me about the premium segment. Listen, what we are seeing is Deutsche has done the stream-on offer, which you can look at it in two different ways. You can say, well, at the end of the day, it's a good thing because it will push the MVNOs into a more difficult space, and it can push the bottom of the market in a more difficult space. You can also say what was available before for 55 and 45 now is available for 55, 45 plus music, plus video. So it's not really a more for more, it's the same for more, so it's a little bit -- the way we would like to implement those things is different, but directionally, I think it's the right direction. Probably, the implementation could be a little bit more inclined to a more-for-more type of strategy.  If I compare our results with Deutsche's results, there's nothing to brag about, but we did better than them in the latest round, so I think we are doing something right. Our giga offers are all inclined to be at the high end and to take usage up in Germany -- usage up to 1.2 gig finally in Germany with these offers. Germans are more cautious users of data. But the vision is the same as Italy, the same as the other places, take people up in usage and try to increase loyalty, reduce churn, improve the right relationship and, eventually, give more data in exchange for this. Dhananjay? Dhananjay Mirchandani Vittorio, my question is related to your branding and commercial strategy in the context of Vodafone 2020. How sustainable is a -- is what, in my view, simplistically spoken, is a monobrand strategy in markets that are increasingly segmented and a competitive landscape -- take BT in the U.K., take Deutsche Telekom in Germany -- where you have, at a minimum, two, if not three, brands that are attempting to address a very different customer segment and needs. Vittorio Colao It is not sustainable, which why we have more brands ourselves, as simple as that. If you look at Germany, we have Otelo, and we have now Vodafone Easy, which is a sub -- it's not exactly a new brand, but it's a sub thing. In Spain, we have Lowi, which is becoming now a converged brand as well. And in Morca in The Netherlands, we have always historically had them. So there's a tactical/segmented user either of product brands -- sorry, Portugal, Greece, I mean, I can mention on and on and on -- of brands which are either segmented brands or discount brands which we really use. I prefer the segmented brands because they cater to a specific segment. Youth is the classic example, Vodafone U or things like that. And I prefer to have some kind of attachment to the main brand. But if needed, we can also have them separate, like we do have in several cases. Dhananjay Mirchandani Can I just very briefly follow up on that? So if you were to take your advertising costs over a five-year period, what percentage of that would you allocate to curating these second brands product or standard. Vittorio Colao Not a huge amount, Dhananjay. And this is the important point to get. Vodafone is the brand that remains a brand, like Deutsche, like Telefónica MoviStar, like everything else. We'd use these second brands or sub-brands. It's, most of the times, focused on segments, and therefore, you have much more direct access, much more online, much less retail, in order to address a specific segment. The massive -- the big part of our 750 million spending still goes into Vodafone. Yes? Robert Grindle It's Robert Grindle from Deutsche Bank in disguise. Vittorio Colao That's really -- I mean, almost unrecognizable. Robert Grindle I'm overly [compensated], what can I say. Yes, just a quick one on Nick's comment on the exiting of the low-margin carrier business in the U.K. Is it a case that you've chosen to exit that type of business, or was there a particular contract? Would you get back into that space if the economics improved at some point in the future? And then my second question is about handset and equipment revenues. There was an even wider gap between total group revenue growth this quarter and service revenue growth. It must be handset sales. But actually, it started to narrow a bit in Europe. I wonder, is the European handset cycle improving? And of course, it's important for future service revenue growth as well. Nick Read So in terms of handset cycles, no, I've not seen any material shifts in handset cycles, so I have to review that gap just to see if there's anything other that's skewing it. But in terms of metrics of handsets sold, no. In terms of the first question was around? Robert Grindle The carrier in the U.K. Nick Read Yes, the U.K. carrier, these are ultra-low, low margins. And our strategy is being one of we build the network for ourselves, and then we can sell capacity to third parties at a reasonable margin. If they get too low, there tends to be high volatility. And we said let's take the volatility out of the system. We have high growth ourselves as a company already, yes. So we chose to exit those contracts, so it's our choice to exit those. Could there be more some more of those next year? Yes, there could always be more of those. So see it as a bit like an airline, you're constantly yield managing your infrastructure for your own business first versus others. Vittorio Colao Yes. Should we go back one and then -- yes, and then Emmet. Guy Peddy It's Guy Peddy from Macquarie. Just want to follow up. There's been lots of chatter about margin in here, but I just wanted to bring it back down to the revenue line. if I look across Europe, there are some -- some operators are giving the messages that, perhaps, things are getting a little bit tougher; consumer pricing is getting a little bit tighter; the ability to absorb price increases is limiting; product innovation is falling, i.e. 4G has been around here for a long time, and giving more data isn't really an innovation; the fixed line side has been no major evolutions of technology, so therefore, things are getting a little bit stagnant as well. Is that something that you're picking up in your business that, perhaps, the overall industry is getting a little bit tougher now than, perhaps, it was 18, 24 months ago when 4G was newer, et cetera? Vittorio Colao Yes, let me give a quick answer. What I'm picking up is that not all of the pricing moves that I see across Europe made complete sense to me. Some of them look a little bit short term and not -- don't factor in competitors' reactions, which I will not say which ones. But clearly, we do like our model because in our model, all pricing moves are very seriously evaluated and very focused by segment, and that's why we think we are generating a good margin to this year. So do we see the same thing? Probably, yes. Do we manage it exactly in the same way? Probably not. And I hope we will be able to continue like that. Back, yes? How many do we have? Tim Boddy One, yes. Two. Vittorio Colao Last two. Unidentified Analyst Okay. Shall I go for the first? A couple of questions. The first one is on -- a follow-up on India. One of the reasons why that keeps going up this year was the € 3.6 billion equity injection in India. Now with the NewCo, you're going -- with the debt you confer yourself, and Idea will have a 4.5 times roughly debt to EBITDA. Because most of the towers are leased, that, that will be capitalized under full credit by the credit ratings, so it will be in excess of sixtimes. And EBITDA is going down 23% on your side, 34% on their side. They have an analogy interest rate of 10% on the debt. If I remember, that's what you said on the presentation of the deal. So do you reckon that is a sustainable balance sheet going forward? And what the risk that you have to keep injecting equity over the next one or two years? And this is actually a side. I've seen also -- I've noticed that more than 10% of your free cash flow is dividends from associates. Then you've got also this shareholder recharged another 20 million, so almost 15% of your free cash flow comes from taking cash out of these associates. What's the gearing you have in place like Australia, Ziggo and, of course, India and Indus, of course, that for one that contributed the dividends? And the second question is on the... Vittorio Colao It's the third. Tim Boddy It's the third on a multilevel. Unidentified Analyst This one is very simple. It's actually a clarification of the broadband because, as you said, was many different variable but a bit convoluted. So you have 36 million NGN coverage, and a coverage on the wholesale of 83 million is the balance between the 119 million and 36 million. How many of the NGN customers connected are on the 36 million coverage? And how many on the wholesale coverage? It should be relatively simple as well. Vittorio Colao Yes. So Tim, you think the last one, please? Tim Boddy Yes, yes. Nick Read Okay, can I suggest, because rather than getting into filling the whole spreadsheet out, we do -- we cover a lot the more detailed points on the ones when afterwards. But what I would say in terms of India, I would say that currently, on the plans of the two combined businesses, there is no further need to put in capital to the business. So of the question then becomes how is trading currently versus our expectation, and we are smack in line with our trading and expectations. So as I say, it's really important that when Jio started charging, what happened to our commercial metrics, and basically, I'm saying they've stabilized, and therefore, we'd gone into April results are in line with our expectation, and the same for Idea. There are a number of other aspects. Obviously, we have to dispose of towers, the orphan towers that sit within our business, their business, India's stake in Indus, obviously, from a leverage perspective. But currently, we feel comfortable from a go-forward basis. I suggest, all the shareholder recharges, et cetera, that our free cash flow is driven of the fact that we have operational leverage on our core business. It's real free cash flow generation. And our capital intensity is now normalizing going forward, which I hopefully highlighted in the presentation. And in terms of on footprint, NGN, 26% penetration on average? Unidentified Company Representative [Indiscernible] 27 million [indiscernible] Vittorio Colao Yes. Yes. Okay. One more, probably the last one, and then we can move to individual sessions with the ExCom members, which I'll introduce quickly. Emmet? Emmet Kelly It's Emmet Kelly of Morgan Stanley. On Slide 35, you talked about some of your new digital businesses... Vittorio Colao Yes. Emmet Kelly In particular, IoT and data analytics. And could you talk a little bit about the data analytics side and how you might be able to monetize that? Just read some reports which show that mobile operators have, perhaps, the best data set out there in the market in terms of Big Data. You've got location based data. A lot of the data you have is real time as well. You have data on some customers going back about three or four years. You have their surf history as well. You say you're not selling to third parties in terms of data monetization. Can you just say what the revenue opportunity could be here at some stage in the future? Vittorio Colao Thank you, Emmet, for your question because it's a very easy answer for me. First of all, thank you for saying that we have one of the most interesting data sets. I am very jealous of one company that knows what we are all thinking and another company that knows what we are all buying. Those two companies also have a very interesting data set. Yes, we do have a very interesting data set, and the answer to your question is we have not, for the time being, decided to apply to third party revenues. The reason is very simple. We had to set up a centralized data analytics unit. We have to hire people in a lot of markets who are very difficult to hire and very much in demand. And we have a huge opportunity in our own business. So the initial work of this 200 and whatever, 50, 80, 60, 300 people by the end of the year is really focused on improving our economics. And there is so much we can do in our own kind of commercial manager. But even in his management view on -- in the technology, where you put sites, how much CapEx you put, where you put it, how you put it, there is so much value that we can generate. And honestly, it's a value that comes with the 30 and plus percent EBITDA margin. While if you sell to third parties, you have completely different type. So for the time being, these units are focused internally. By the end of this year, when we have deployed everywhere and we are 100% sure that we have the cruising speed on our own exploitment, then we'll start thinking about the external work. Now let me very quickly say that we would really love to interact with you on a one to one basis. Just for your information, you have -- if you're interested in small European countries, Ahmed is the CEO of the small countries, raise your hand; Brian is the new CEO of enterprise; Margherita, Deputy CFO on cost and everything else. Matthew Kirk and, behind him, Joakim Reiter, his successor on Regulation and all the pleasures of dealing with Brussels; Vivek, CEO of emerging markets and the expert of Safaricom, Vodacom, India and everything else; Rosemary Martin, if you're interested in compliance, anti bribery and legal risks; and Johan, CTO, is very well known. Thank you very much for your questions. We really look forward to a further interaction in the next 15 or 20 minutes. Thank you. Nick Read Thank you.

Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Bart Morselt, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir. Bart Morselt  Yes, thank you. Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, and again welcome to our first quarter 2017 results call.  Today, I'm pleased to be joined on this call by Jean-Yves Charlier, VEON’s Chief Executive Officer, and Andrew Davies, VEON’s Chief Financial Officer. The structure of the presentation mirrors the previous quarterly results with Jean-Yves starting with the key financial and strategic highlights of the Group, followed by Andrew running us through the operational results review for both the group and the key countries, ending with comments on the full year 2017 guidance. At the end of Andrew’s discussion, we will open the line for the Q&A session. Before getting started, I would like to draw your attention to the necessary disclaimer. Forward-looking statements made during today's presentations involve certain risks and uncertainties. These statements relate, in part, to the company's anticipated performance and guidance for 2017, including its ability to generate sufficient cash flow, future market developments and trends, expected synergies of the Italy joint venture and the Warid transaction, and the company’s ability to realize its targets and strategic initiatives. Certain factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including the risks detailed in the company's annual report on Form 20-F, and other recent public filings made by the company with the SEC. The earnings release and the earnings presentation, each of which includes reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures presented today, can be downloaded from our website. With that introduction, I would like now to hand over to Jean-Yves. Jean-Yves? Jean-Yves Charlier Thank you, Bart and good afternoon. Let me start by focusing on the highlights of the quarter.  VEON reported double-digit revenue and EBITDA growth and close to $200 million of underlying equity free cash flow. After multiple years of currency depreciation, the Group is finally enjoying some currency tailwinds, resulting in a robust year-on-year growth rate of our financials.  On an organic basis, revenues were flat for the quarter, accounting for the effect of the leap year while EBITDA margin strengthened. Our JV in Italy posted solid results with both top line and underlying EBITDA growth and with the merger integration and resulting synergies on track with our plans. This is a good start of the year and allows us to confirm the full year 2017 guidance which we presented at the end of February in Barcelona during the full year 2016 results presentation.  The quarter was also marked by the achievement of a series of major milestones in the transformation of our Group. We announced during the quarter that the Group was resuming a meaningful dividend policy and in April we distributed a final dividend of $0.195. This amount was the compliment to a dividend paid in December 2016 of $0.035 bringing the dividend for 2016 to a total of $0.23.  During the same event in Barcelona, we introduced VEON, a new personal Internet platform, the main initiative for our Group to accelerate our digital strategy and strengthen our core telecom business. It is on this digital ambition that we also decided to rebrand the company from VimpelCom to VEON. Only a few weeks after rebranding and presenting our strategic update, we initiated a dual-listing on Euronext Amsterdam. We now trade on both NASDAQ and Amsterdam Euronext under the new ticker VEON. The Amsterdam listing is in euros and in ordinary shares whereas NASDAQ continues to be in dollars and in ADSs.  On April 6, Telenor, our second largest shareholder contributed to expand our free float by placing a further 4% stake mainly on NASDAQ but also some of it on Euronext. The free float has more than doubled now year on year and stands at approximately 24%. Finally, we increased our stake in GTH to 57.7% as a result of the cancellation of the Treasury shares in GTH and the share buyback program.  Let me now present on the Slide 4 the financial highlights of the quarter. Total revenue grew 13.1% year on year, boosted by both the consolidation of Warid in Pakistan and currency tailwinds. Revenues were organically stable adjusting for the leap year effect.  Reported EBITDA also increased by 14% year on year, also due to the Warid consolidation and currency tailwinds. Underlying EBITDA margin grew organically by 0.6 percentage points year on year and stood at just above 39%. Underlying equity cash flow was $194 million, up from $41 million in the prior year quarter.  CapEx increased year on year mainly due to procurement-led delays in the first quarter of 2016 with the last twelve months CapEx to revenue ratio of 18.7%. The times of high CapEx levels are over at VEON as we’ve moved to a new operating model where we will be more and more rights spending instead. As of today we are on track to achieve the 2017 guidance.  Let me turn to presenting VEON in more detail -- our personal Internet platform which is at the center of our digital strategy. VEON integrates communication, messaging, and everything the Internet has to offer with powerful video analytics and artificial intelligence to put the user in control.  To start with, we will focus on building a global user base and user engagement. VEON has been launched as a beta in Italy and has already generated more than 1.5 million downloads. In this quarter we will launch VEON 2.0 in Georgia and Russia to begin with, as well as upgrade users in Italy. This release will include: first of all, a digital state-of-the-art account management platform and also a full feature messaging platform for our customers as well as users from other networks with free messaging, chat and voice calling even when out of credit.  It will also include a secure and fully authenticated digital identity with the possibility to connect to any payment instrument. And finally, it will also incorporate personalized content, including video, music and news. We have already announced global partnerships with MasterCard, Vivendi and Deezer and will include many more content partners at launch in every country.  The short to medium term objective of this launch is to create engagement with the large customer base we serve and transforming the relationship with these customers from a brick and mortar to a digital relationship, with the objectives of creating better customer loyalty, reducing churn, and reducing our cost structure in areas such as distribution and call centers. It’s in many ways about strengthening our core telecoms business.  The medium to long term objectives will be about monetizing new services through our partners on a revenue share model. While this is an ambitious strategy, we expect to invest approximately $100 million annually into this platform over the next few years. This is relatively modest compared to our overall investments in our core telecom business and can be absorbed while delivering on our cash flow growth targets.  Let me now turn to Slide 6. On the 4 th  of April we successfully listed VEON on Euronext Amsterdam. The main purpose of the dual listing is to broaden our investor base potentially leveraging on the fact that we could be included at a certain point in time in new stock indices. Our presence in Amsterdam, which is where our headquarters are, will allow us to gain more visibility to both European investors and brokers. The shares on Euronext and NASDAQ are fungible and will -- and we have agreed with the depositary bank to waive the cancellation fees for the first 70 million NASDAQ listed ADSs transferred into ordinary shares. Since our listing on the 4 th  of April, some 15 million ADSs were already transferred into ordinary shares in Amsterdam, representing close to 5% of our free float.  Finally, as required by the European Union transparency directive, we announced that VEON Ltd. home member state is the Netherlands while the country of incorporation continues to be Bermuda.  Turning to Slide 7, in April, Telenor decided to further sell down its holding in VEON and as a result, we now have a free float of just above 24%, a significant improvement to the 10% of free float the Group had a number of years ago. The major shareholders remain LetterOne, followed by Telenor which still holds close to 20% of our Group. We continue to welcome a potential increase of the free float should Telenor decide to dispose of more shares in the future.  Earlier in the year, we announced our new dividend policy, which is a commitment to paying a sustainable and progressive dividend based on the evolution of the company's equity free cash flow. We also announced at the same time the payment of a dividend in the aggregate amount of $0.23 per share for 2016 comprised of $0.035 paid in December 2016 and a final dividend payment a month ago. Total dividend payments for 2016 added up to a sizable $404 million. Going forward we aim to distribute both interim and final dividends respectively in the third quarter and first quarter of the year.  I will now hand over to Andrew for the detailed results. Andrew? Andrew Davies Thank you, Jean-Yves and good afternoon or good morning from me as well.  I would like to start today with the key driver for the double digit topline growth just discussed by Jean-Yves – this currency appreciation against the US dollar. The VEON Coin had shown an inflection from Q1 2016 onwards with a further positive year on year acceleration during the first quarter of 2017, thanks mainly the appreciation of the ruble. Again this phenomenon explains the bulk of the year-on-year revenue growth for this quarter, and as we noted when we presented our full year 2016 results in Barcelona, if the currencies remained stable from where they are today, this would enable us to outperform our full year equity free cash flow guidance by up to $100 million.  Now move on to the next slide on revenue. In the waterfall chart, we provide a breakdown of the evolution of VEON’s total revenue both in reported and organic terms. On a reported basis, our first quarter 2017 revenue grew by 13% year on year, boosted by FOREX as have already noted and the Warid acquisition. Excluding Warid, the year-on-year growth would have still been very robust at over 8% year on year.  Looking at the composition, you can see from the top chart, the continued strong growth in data and MFS revenue is upset by a decrease in voice revenue, which remains a secular trend across the industry. Mobile data revenue showed strong growth of 48% year on year, up 31% on an organic basis driven by the continued focus on monetizing the deployment of various high speed data networks. In the bottom chart, you can see that on an organic like-for-like basis, revenue decreased by 1% year on year and in this like-for-like calculation we have included Warid’s revenue from the first quarter of 2016. The slightly negative year-on-year trend is entirely attributable to the leap year effect with an extra day in the first quarter of 2016. If you look at the geographical breakdown, you see the pressure on revenue mainly came from Algeria and Russia with strong growth in each of Pakistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan.  Now move to Slide 11, the EBITDA waterfall which shows a broadly similar profile. On a reported basis, EBITDA improved almost 14% year on year. Excluding performance transformation cost of $40 million in first quarter 2016, and $30 million in 2017, and including Warid in the Q1 2016 baseline, the year-on-year like-for-like growth of underlying EBITDA would have been 8.9%.  As you can see in the top chart, on a year-on-year basis the performance transformation program has contributed approximately $95 million in the first quarter of 2017 to the underlying EBITDA improvement, more than offsetting short term reinvestments in value-creative initiatives such as mono brand shop devices and network development. In Q1, this reinvestment aimed to driving future growth is equal to $74 million.  If you look at the bottom chart, we see that on an organic underlying basis, EBITDA also shows solid upward momentum growing by half a percentage point excluding both the positive currency impact and the exceptional items that I’ve just discussed.  The trend can be summarized again as follows: The slightly negative development in Russia and Algeria being more than compensated by the remaining countries, among which Pakistan and Ukraine again showed the highest contribution. Uzbekistan was slightly negative and I’ll explain later the specific reasons underpinning the trend there.  Moving now on to the country review, starting as usual with Russia. Both the macro-economic conditions and the ruble continued to stabilize during the first quarter but the conditions and competition in the Russian market remained challenging at the same time.  Total revenue decreased year on year by 2% due to a 14% year-on-year decrease in fixed line service revenue, mainly driven by the effect of the strengthening ruble on U.S. dollar denominated contract. Mobile service revenue increased by 1%, driven by growth in mobile data, value added services, mobile financial services and interconnect revenue, partially offset by decrease in voice.  Adjusting for the leap year effect, mobile service revenue increased 2% year on year. Mobile data revenue continued to grow at double digit rates during the quarter increasing 16% year on year. This was attributable to bundle promotions, increased smartphone penetration, growth in mobile data customers and traffic growth.  Mobile ARPU grew 3% year on year driven by the continued efforts to simplify tariff plans and successful up-selling activities, while also being supported by the increased penetration of bundle propositions in the customer base.  Underlying EBITDA adjusted for transformation costs decreased 1% year on year with an underlying EBITDA margin of 37.6%. CapEx excluding licenses more than doubled year on year during the quarter as a result of two primary effects. Firstly, we had some procurement-led delays during the first quarter of 2016; and secondly, our Group-wide CapEx planning for 2017 is even more disciplined than last year and in particular there will be a much more consistent linear phasing across the quarters this year and therefore much less of a hockey-stick effect in the fourth quarter.  Beeline continues to accelerate the rollout of mobile high speed data network and which led to a 67% 4G/LTE population coverage at the end of the quarter.  We now move on to emerging market, starting with Pakistan. First of all, let me please note that the pro forma comparative numbers on here are a non-GAAP measure and also do not include any purchase price allocation adjustment.  Pakistan continues to show strong momentum in the first quarter as the merger integration is almost complete. The annual run rate of gross synergies amounted to just over 11 billion Pakistani rupees to just over $100 million and Jazz is fully focused on the network integration.  Looking at the key financials. Revenue increased by more than 6% year on year, boosted by both data revenue growing at a rate of close to 30%, and mobile financial services with 24% growth compared to last year, which again has been restated to include the pro forma contribution of Warid. The customer base increased by 9% year on year driven by continued customer satisfaction with Jazz’s focus on price simplicity, distribution availability, and offer transparency.  Underlying EBITDA margin, excluding 0.6 billion rupees of restructuring costs related to both performance transformation and the Warid integration was 43.4% in the first quarter 2017, improving by almost 4 percentage points year on year.  CapEx increased year on year in the first quarter of 2017, while the last twelve months CapEx to revenue ratio decreased to 17.7% and 3G population coverage at the end of the quarter was 42%. The regulator has issued an Information Memorandum for the auction of 10 megahertz of paired technology nuclear spectrum in the 1800 megahertz band and the auction is currently expected to be completed by the end of the second quarter 2017, with a base price for that auction of $295 million.  Moving now on to Algeria. Following the appointment of Matthieu Galvani as chief executive officer of Djezzy in January, the recruitment of the remainder of the leadership team has been completed in order to drive the turnaround and the transformation of Djezzy into a digital leader. The regulatory environment has recently improved in Algeria, although as noted in our Q4 2016 results, the mobile termination rate asymmetry in the country is still a topic which remains under discussion with the regulator.  The country has a challenging macro-economic environment with inflation accelerating to 8% in February and a new finance law in effect since the first of January which has increased pressure on the results through an increase of VAT from 7% to 19% on data services from the 17% to 19% on voice services and also increased taxes on recharges from 5% to 7%. These higher indirect taxes directly influenced performance of the company as they could not be passed on to the customers.  Customer base in Algeria decreased 4% year on year to just over $16 million as a result of the competitive pressure and our own commercial missteps as we previously discussed. Service revenue decreased by 16% year on year, notwithstanding the very robust data revenue growth of 58% which is boosted by a substantial increase in both data customers and consumption as a result of the 3G and 4G/LTE network rollout. Not only was the company the leader in NPS in the first quarter but it has also established leadership in 4G/LTE in the country with a population coverage already above 20%.  Last but not least, underlying EBITDA margin was still close to 50% benefiting from the performance transformation and this would have been above 51% excluding the impact of the indirect tax increases.  Moving on to Slide 15 on Bangladesh, where the operational focus during the first quarter continued to be on improving network coverage which drove the data growth. Total revenue in the quarter decreased by 1% year on year while bundling service revenue decreased 3% as a result of aggressive competition and also of the imposition of an incremental 2% supplementary duty on recharges effective from June of 2016 on top of the 1% surcharge already introduced in March of 2016, together with the gap in 3G network coverage versus the market leader.  Data revenue continues to be very strong at a 43% year-on-year growth while the ARPU trend is also positive at a 2.3% year on year growth.  Underlying EBITDA decreased by 6% year on year as a result of higher customer acquisition costs and also the higher cost of handsets which more than offset the savings stemming from the performance transformation program. Underlying EBITDA margin was still robust at 46% so that represents a reduction of 2.2 percentage points year on year compared to the first quarter 2016.  Finally, on network at the end of the first quarter 3G population coverage reached 65% and the catch-up versus the competition is in line with our expectations.  Moving on to Ukraine, we reported [ph] continued strong results during the quarter despite both the challenging macroeconomic environment and the weakening currency. And we remain the clear leader in both revenue market share and in NPS. Total revenue grew 12% and mobile service revenue increased 11% year on year driven by successful commercial activities and continued strong growth in mobile data revenue, which grew 70% year on year, driven by growing data customers, successful marketing activities and the launch of new data bundles.  The customer base grew 3% year on year as a result of improvements in churn and increased gross additions, which was driven by promotional activities, for mainly B2C customers. Underlying EBITDA adjusted for performance transformation costs, grew 15% year on year, mainly as a result of higher revenue and lower interconnect costs. This resulted in an increase of underlying EBITDA margin by 1.6 percentage points to a very strong 53.6%.  CapEx increased year on year because of procurement-led delays during the first quarter of 2016. For the last twelve months, CapEx intensity ratio is trending down. 3G population coverage increased to 65%, up from 40% in the first quarter of last year.  Now move on to Uzbekistan on Slide 17. We reported solid revenue performance in that country with total revenue growing 10% year on year driven by the impact of Beeline´s price plans being denominated in U.S. dollars, together with successful marketing activities and increased revenues from interconnect services, value added services, and mobile data.  Mobile data revenue increased 30%, driven by the continued high speed data network rollout, increased smartphone penetration, and the launch of new bundled offerings. The overall customer base increased 1% year on year, reporting the first growth is the fourth quarter since the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of strong gross additions and lower churn, which improved on an annualized basis by 1 percentage point to 48%.  Underlying EBITDA decreased 4.1% excluding the positive effect of reversals of both litigation provision and the bad debt provision during the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in the underlying EBITDA was mainly driven by higher interconnect costs as a result of both higher off-net usage, and the negative currency effect, together with increases in content costs, customer costs and structural OpEx. The underlying EBITDA margin remains at a strong level, well above 50%.  Last twelve months CapEx to revenue ratio increased to 26% despite the year-on-year decrease in CapEx during the first quarter. This is mainly due to prepayments of equipment in the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter of 2016 for deployment in 2017.  I will now close the country review with a brief discussion on Italy, following the JV’s presentation of its own results a couple days ago. Results were solid and synergies remained in line with the previously communicated target.  Revenue in the first quarter of 2017 increased by 2.1% driven by higher sales of mobile handsets, coupled with growth in service revenue and broadly stable results in mobile service revenue, which grew by 0.4% adjusted for the leap year effect, while mobile ARPU for the quarter remained stable year on year at just over €11.  Fixed service revenue grew by 2.3% driven by an 8.6% growth in broadband revenue with a solid ARPU growth close to 3%. Underlying EBITDA, excluding non-recurring items, grew strongly by 9.7% driven by the stable service revenues and the realization of synergies. While the underlying EBITDA margin increased by 2.3 percentage points to 33.3%.  CapEx for the quarter totaled €240 million and was primarily focused on capacity and coverage of both the 4G/LTE and HSPA+ networks. For the last twelve months, CapEx intensity ratio decreased to 17.4% from 18% last year. At the end of the quarter the net leverage ratio was at 4.1 times. Finally, the JV contributed a loss of $89 million to VEON’s P&L primarily driven by integration costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.  Now move on to Slide 19, which shows the Group’s income statement. I’ll concentrate my attention below the EBITDA line. Reported depreciation and amortization increased year on year by 14% as a result of FOREX, in particular the appreciation of the ruble versus the dollar, and the Warid acquisition.  Net financial expenses were driven upwards by the $1.2 billion of GTH bonds issued in April last year and the consolidation of Warid’s debt. The most visible impact in this quarter comes in the line capturing the share results from JV’s and associates. The significant decrease year on year on this line was primarily driven by the share of loss from Wind Tre as I’ve just discussed.  Taxes in absolute terms increased by 21% year on year, driven by higher profitability in countries with a higher tax rate and a net deferred tax provision in excess of $50 million recorded in the quarter, although it’s important to note that cash taxes remained completely stable year on year.  On profit from discontinued operations which is disappeared this quarter as we no longer account for Italy in this line. I’d just want to note that last year's first quarter results were positively affected by the fair valuation of call options embedded within WIND’s bonds.  I will now move on to the net debt analysis on Slide 20. We closed the first quarter with $7.7 billion of net debt and a leverage ratio of 2.1 times. Before FOREX and exceptional items included within which was $257 million related to the GTH share buyback and $69 million related to the settlement of the Iraqna litigation, the leverage ratio would have been 1.9 times.  Moving on to the next slide, with an update on corporate finance activities. During the first quarter we signed a multi-currency revolving credit facility and term loan for up to $2.25 billion with a pool of global banks. Repaid bonds issued by our Russian business is 96% of the bonds maturing in 2022 with puts towards following a rate reset. We've also been working to address the refinancing of other elements of PJSC’s ruble denominated debt, aiming at both reducing the cost of debt and eliminating some of the structural limitations. These corporate finance initiatives support the group in securing a strong liquidity profile extending maturities and moving towards a leaner capital structure with more centralized borrowing. In the first quarter we also reduced the average debt by roughly a quarter percentage point.  Now move on to the last item of financials before I get to guidance. So as already discussed, the cash flow generation in the first quarter was very healthy and in line with both our internal and external expectations. In the first quarter of 2016 we delivered $41 million of underlying equity free cash flow but we've grown this significantly in the first quarter of 2017. The robust increase in net cash from operating activities of approximately $200 million more than offset increased cash used for investing activities, resulting in an underlying equity free cash flow for the quarter of just below $200 million.  I’ll now move on to Slide 23 on guidance. So our Q1 results were in line with our expectations and were in line with the guidance trend. From a revenue perspective, the impact of the leap year in Q1 was quite visible and we expect that on a full year basis this will be absorbed and for this reason we confirm the full year 2017 guidance of low single digit organic growth.  Underlying EBITDA margin in the quarter grew organically by 0.6 percentage points in line with our guidance to deliver a low single digit accretion in 2017. Finally, as I’ve just commented on, equity free cash flow was an underlying $194 million for the quarter and this leaves us confident on the target for the full year. The target of $700 million to $800 million for the full year included approximately $200 million of investment for spectrum licenses, which is what the Group has typically invested in an average year over the medium term. However 2017 might see a slight increase in the investment in spectrum.  As I've already noted, we expect the Pakistan 4G spectrum auction to conclude by the end of the second quarter, and that it is possible that we will also have 4G spectrum auctions in both Bangladesh and Ukraine before the end of 2017. If this were to happen, there’s two very important points to note. Firstly, we would therefore expect a pretty de minis payment on spectrum in the next two to three years as there is no other major spectrum auctions or requirements on the horizon.  And secondly, for a bundle clarity, we are comfortable with being able to adequately fund any of these auctions and therefore they would have absolutely zero impact on our sustainable and progressive dividend policy.  And with this, we now start the Q&A session. Operator, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Mattie Singh [ph] from Morgan Stanley.  Unidentified Analyst Just a couple of questions, first on Algeria. Is there any help in understanding when the revenue recovery might be visible, understand that new management has just taken charge but any help in understanding the trends there would be very very appreciated? Secondly, in Bangladesh also, the growth being quite volatile, and do you consider Bangladesh as a growth market but we have hardly active in any revenue growth recently. So if you could explain -- is there any opportunities still left in Bangladesh or we should actually start looking at it as a mature market? Andrew Davies Sure, I'll do that. So let me address Algeria first of all. So I'm not going to give a specific timeline of when we expect to get back to year-on-year revenue stability let alone growth. But here's how I would think about it. We knew that the first quarter of this year was probably going to be our toughest quarter from a year-on-year comparison perspective, simply because it’s the first quarter last year where we made some of the commercial missteps which actually gave us a short-term bulk in pricing effective BUs and therefore revenues and then we started to suffer the customer losses and in particular the high value customer losses from round about the end of first quarter 2016 onwards. We do see a little bit of a gradual sequential progress right now in Algeria, so I would expect that over the course of 2017 that rate of year-on-year decline should diminish. But I still think that we're probably two to four quarters away from actually seeing anything approaching year-on-year revenue stability.  With regards to Bangladesh, as I’ve noted it’s a very competitive market right now. The market has gone through quite a bit of transition, if you will, in the last twelve months. There's been the imposition of these supplementary duties which clearly has increased government revenues but is taking money directly out of the operators’ revenue pool. And then in addition, you had SIM verification exercise and it's been a lot of aggressive competition for new customers following the completion of that SIM verification exercise and then also you’ve had a merger exercise between Robi and Airtel and that also obviously creates a little bit of more competitive tension in the early aftermath.  Jean-Yves Charlier I think you're right and you described the market as being a little volatile right now. However we would not begin to call this a mature market, we still think that there is plenty of revenue growth to come from this market in the medium to long term. And if you look at all of the normal statistics, I mean, user penetration, smartphone penetration, and data usage, they all lag well behind what a mature market would exhibit. So there's a lot more upside to come from Bangladesh. And also we're going to broaden the coverage. With that, we’re still only at a 65% population coverage on the 3G network right now. So there's a lot of customers out there that don't even have the reach of a bundle linked 3G network right now. So I would not characterize this as a mature market.  Unidentified Analyst And quickly on the Russian revenue trend, so if you could explain the decline in the fixed line business and is that a trend we can see continuing during 2017? Andrew Davies Well, as I said in my notes, it’s all driven by U.S. dollar denominated contracts, so roughly between 15% to 20% of the Russia's fixed line customer base has U.S. dollar denominated contract and therefore with the ruble appreciating, that just simply translates into a lower amount of ruble equivalent revenues. I mean that is almost exclusively the driver for the fixed line trend in Russia.  Operator We take our next question from Herve Drouet from HSBC.  Herve Drouet  I’ve got a couple of question as well on my side. The first one is back on Algeria, I understand there's been some change in taxes, VAT, those type of things. I was wondering how and why could you not transfer part of it to the end user? Is it because competition did not signal any willingness to do it? And if it is the case, do you think that can change in the future looking forwards or do you think the current pricing that's to be passed partly to the end subscribers? The second question is on Pakistan, the subscriber acquisition costs increased; could you give a bit more light on the reason what is behind this SAC increase and also on the auctions on the spectrum, and the base price which has been put up $295 million they get; is it for the band you are targeting or is it for all the bands which are being put under auctions? So those are the main questions. Thanks.  Jean-Yves Charlier Andrew, I can take Algeria, you want to do Pakistan? Andrew Davies Sure; why not? Jean-Yves Charlier All right .So on Algeria, in terms of the increased tax and VAT, I think that we found it difficult in the position that Djezzy is in to pass those on to the consumer. I think there's a few issues here to note. First, the third mobile operator, Mobily is extremely aggressive from a pricing point of view. So I think that at this stage very difficult to see ARPU increases there. And secondly, the macroeconomic environment is not good in Algeria and consumer spending is under considerable pressure, particularly with inflation on food and other items. So the contact both competitively and economically did not enable us to pass those increases onto the consumer demand. I don’t know, Andrew, before you address Pakistan if you want to say anything else on Algeria.  Andrew Davies No, nothing else to say, you got it spot on, Jean-Yves. So on Pakistan, Herve, let me address the spectrum question first of all. So there is just one lot of 10 megahertz of paid spectrum in the 1800 megahertz band. Now it's technology neutral, so therefore it’s absolutely within a kind of our process -- is the absolute kind of spectrum that we want to obtain in the country. I didn't quite understand your first question, if I'm completely honest.  Herve Drouet  So basically in term of the pricing with the spectrum because you indicate in your guidance that your underlying equity free cash flow includes, if I well understood, the average annual purchase of spectrum license in the region of around $200 million. So I was wondering -- I mean do you believe what may happen in Pakistan will be included in what you consider to be the average annual purchase of the spectrum license and – or can it also include a potentially as well some spectrum inclusion on Bangladesh or you think it's out of the scope? Andrew Davies Look, clearly the guidance on equity free cash flow for the year assumed that we would spend what’s been our run rate -- average run rate over the last three to four years of $200 million. So clearly to the extent that we spend $295 million or thereabouts in Pakistan, that would -- all of the things being equal, would put a little bit of pressure on the guidance. And obviously we do have the benefit right now of currency tailwinds and there’s a number of other things, well so I don't see as being a grave danger to guidance right now. And as I said as well, I mean to the extent that it happens in a way to bring forward from next year, so really it doesn't affect how we think about the evolution of equity free cash flow over the medium to long term and we are very comfortable with being able to fund it, so with an absolutely zero impact on sustainable and progressive dividend policy that we've announced.  But sorry, I also thought you asked some kind of question related to – Herve Drouet  On the EBITDA margins, I mean so basically on the -- I was wondering I think there was a change on the subscriber acquisition costs. If I would remember, that has a plan –  Jean-Yves Charlier That was in Bangladesh, no Pakistan. Herve Drouet  Yes, in Bangladesh, sorry.  Jean-Yves Charlier Okay, yes, Bangladesh, I mean that's driven simply by a higher level of gross additions following the completion of the SIM verification exercise. If you look at the earnings release, we reported roughly a 3.5% year-on-year decline in customer numbers but really the impact of the verification program would actually – did result in 3.8 million SIMs being blocked which in isolation would have caused roughly a 9% impact on their customer base. So the level of -- clearly in order to get to them the 3.5% year-on-year reduction, the level of gross additions that we’ve done in the quarter, year on year is much higher than it was in 2016. So it’s a volume thing rather than a [indiscernible] aspect.  Operator We now take our next question from Irina Idrissova from RBC Capital Markets.  Irina Idrissova  Hi thank you very much for taking my question. So from Bangladesh for me as well, the first on the price pressures that you've seen, how is that trending into Q2 and what do you expect for the rest of the year given the consolidation, do you expect some more rationale in pricing perhaps, and then also on the network, when do you expect to catch up to the market leader on 3G coverage and then also looking ahead to 4G, given the possible upcoming auction, do you dissipate another large scale network rollout, the spend associated with that; could you just give us more color in that? Thank you.  Jean-Yves Charlier Andrew, you want to take both?  Andrew Davies Yes sure. On the pricing side of things, we're here to report Q1 results, I am not going to start talking about Q2. I think it's too early to say what we think is going to happen for the rest of the year. I mean clearly there is room for a little more rationality in pricing in Bangladesh and in particular I think if you think what we've been able to successfully do in other markets such as Russia, Algeria, Kazakhstan, it's moving towards a much, much cleaner and simpler, they defend the pricing architecture and getting away from some of the clutter that telcos typically suffer from when they're still in the nascent period of rolling out data services.  I think on spectrum, as I've indicated when I discussed cash flow guidance for the year, that has the potential for a 4G spectrum auction in the country later this year. And I think clearly we'd be interested in participating in that auction and clearly there would be some impact on -- in terms of having a 4G network rollout et cetera but that's probably a 2018 and 2019 thing. And overall long term that would still leave us with a more efficient network architecture. Because on average the cost of production of a 4G data network is roughly only 20% of that -- of a 3G. data network given the propagation characteristics and the other architectural parameters et cetera.  In terms of catching up on the 3G network, I think we’re several quarters away from being able to catch up with the market leader when it comes to the 3G network coverage and quite frankly depending on how quickly the 4G spectrum auction comes along, we may never get there on 3G because it may get surpassed in relatively short order by the 4G network.  Operator We will now move to our question Sergey Libin from Raiffeisen Bank. Sergey Libin  So first one, I wanted just to have a follow up on Pakistan frequency auction, so how important has this worked for you and probably how far can you go with the price increases to the competition is significant and could you also describe the competitive situation in the country? So what do you think whether the U.S. will be aggressive in talks from ops [ph]? And secondly if you could clarify your spectrum reallocation in Uzbekistan; so does it mean that whole amount of the spend will be withdrawn as proposed by the authorities or is it just some parts of your spectrum that's going to be withdrawn and redistributes it so that all the operators have more or less far amounts of frequencies.  Jean-Yves Charlier Okay, maybe I can say a few words on them, and Andrew, you can complement I think in Pakistan neither Andrew or I would really want to discuss any form of auction strategy and why our thinking is that. There was a previous auction last year for a block of spectrum. We did not participate in that auction because we were in the midst of the Warid Transaction. If I recall correctly, only Telenor participated in that auction. So I think the competitive landscape is at different levels in the sense that I'm not sure we should expect that all four parties will participate in this process. So I don't think there is more to say really on Pakistan at this stage.  On Uzbek spectrum realignment, we've been through this process recently in Ukraine on an issue of fragmentation or defragmentation of the spectrum. I think we're still in very early days with discussions with the Uzbek government on this .Obviously alignment for us just makes no sense because the market positions between the three operators are different. And so I think we have a very strong case to maintain that our spectrum portfolio should be more enhanced and the other two players in the marketplace.  Operator [Operator Instructions] We will now take a question from the Beatrice Bushati from East Capital. Beatrice Bushati  Hello, thank you for taking my question. I wanted to hear what your thoughts are on outlook for HQ costs including the interest that you're paying currently, is there any plans to restructure the payments and et cetera and bring down HQ costs? Jean-Yves Charlier As it pertains to interest, and debt structure, Andrew, you want to take that?  Andrew Davies Yeah, sure. Let me take that one. So as I mentioned in Barcelona we are looking to do quite a bit further optimization of the debt structure in 2017. We've already made a good start in the first quarter by some of the actions that we've done. We see an opportunity based on where the markets are right now to potentially refinance -- I wouldn't use the word restructure like you did, but refinance quite a bit of our debt portfolio. The intent as I mentioned in Barcelona is to do a number of things. So we want to move towards a more balanced currency mix. The deck structure is still 2 US dollar centric, so we want to move to more of a broader mix across particularly ruble, euros as a natural hedge against our investment in the Italian J.V., dollars and also increasing our exposure to some of the currencies that we have in our emerging markets portfolio.  We want to move to a broader mix -- in terms of the type of debt, but which I mean today we are too dependent on bonds and we want move on to a better mix between bond bank debt and ECA tech facilities and in that regard clearly the tune that quarter, billion R.C.F. into term loan that we put in place in the first quarter was an important step. We want to do to remove all of the upstream garment tees and other structural limitations that we have within the debt structure -- and then also start using in a Moe, more assertive manner the in-house bank through which we would have bring in the debt on a more centralized basis initially, but then flow that through the subsidiary legal entity structure via the in-house bank. That will be a significant tax benefits both within the inhouse bank itself and in so doing so clearly, I helped with the upstreaming of cash to headquarters. So yes we're going to continue to do it to look at next close all of that in the rest of 2021, quite a material going forward in both Headquarters interest costs and in the past both our headquarters, employees costs, and the tax costs more generally across the Group.  And then I have notified I think in Barcelona. The full year impact of a full yea benefit of those initiatives which will obviously only come into 2018 onwards, is probably the main reason why we see an increase in equity free cash flow for 2018 to at least $1 billion US compared to the seven to eighteen million US dollars that we've got used to for this year.  Operator Our next question comes from Alexander Venganotvitch [indiscernible]  Unidentified Analyst Two questions from my side; so first on the bundling – on the frequencies of bundle [ph] Pakistan, how do you plan to finance this acquisition? Do you think you're going to manage this type of acquisition via like a own plant at these business units, or I think you'll need to wireless general accounting from there. And just can you also confirm that this like additional spending on the frequency will have no impact on your dividend guidance. So I understand that you saw negative effect on equity cash flow but if you just like sort of how –  Jean-Yves Charlier Yes, I was maybe just going to take maybe the second part just to reaffirm what you said in that, we see this hum of Spectrum of investments in 2017, potentially having some bearing on our equity free cash flow guidance but no bearing on our dividend and progressive dividend policy. And as Andre said we would expect, if we have these auctions in Pakistan and Bangladesh in subsequent years, particularly in 2018, that are sort of $200 to assumed $1 million per annum for spectrum would be greatly reduced. So I think we can only reaffirm those statements.  In terms of financing under Andrew – Pakistan, Bangladesh? Andrew Davies I mean Ukraine, yeah, so in terms of funding without being overly specific, we are very comfortable that we're going to be – we would be able to fund any of those auctions in local currencies using either the cash that's already being generated by those operations, or by putting in place additional financing instruments in the countries.  Operator We will now take a question from Alastair Jones from New Street Research. Alastair Jones  Yeah thanks for the question. Just wanted to talk briefly about Russia. I mean, we stored an improvement in your overall revenue. Mobile service revenue growth was flattened last quarter, it's up about 2% if you adjusted the leap year effect .What's driven that improvement in revenue growth, is it to do mostly with consumer spend? Or is it to do with competitive pressures maybe easing a little bit and in relation to that can you talk a little bit about your tariff strategies, we’ve heard price increase from the other guys, removal of unlimited data plan. So just wondering what your thinking is going forward. And then the second question just also on Russia in terms of the margins with a slight increase in 40 bps. I know you’re guiding some for the revenue that’s revenue 60% improvement in margins. Is it right to assume then archive field [ph] that would be further increases in the margin going forward in the rest of the rest of the year or is there anything specific, let’s just talk about maybe margins might be ticked up as we go through the of course of the year. Jean-Yves Charlier All right. I can take part of that question, Andrew will complement that. I think what we've seen is a more stable market following a degree of stability that was reached in Q4 in the Russian marketplace, certainly much better than what we saw in the first half of 2016. We've been advocating I think of the top three operators that the market really needs to move from voice centric pricing to a data centric pricing. We took early decisions in 2016 to exit the unlimited medium large screen bundled data bundles and as we continue to change our tariff structure we hope that the market is going to follow and hence create I think even further stability and potential, further stability in the revenue growth trends that we've recently seen. So I think that's the context overall. Andrew, you do want to add some details and particularly on the margins? Andrew Davies I think Russia is a good support of margins, for the first quarter --- probably on balance in line with our expectations, and I think you would be fair to say, for the first quarter it's probably going to be slightly easier easier comparisons for us than other quarters because we did have a couple of commercial issues around bad debt costs and overly subsidizing devices in the first quarter of 2016. So I would not get overly carried away with 40 bps to 60 bps improvement in underlying EBITDA in Russia for just one quarter right. There's a lot of hard work to do to stabilize the margins and really radically transform that business, obviously that is across the rest of the group. So I would say that overall we're pleased with where the margins are in the first quarter and I guess we've got roughly across the group 60 bps, organic year on year increase, now that is not adjusted for the leap year, right? When you actually adjust margins for the leap year effect, which obviously is a real thing, you can't lose a day in the quarter and pretend as if nothing happened. The underlying margin growth on a day for day -- life like for likesome databases is actually well over a percentage point year on year. So that's still within the confines of a low single digit accretion guidance for the year. So I think we're pleased with where we are but we're not -- I wouldn't get overly bullish and start thinking that we're going to talk about materially different guidance on margins as we go through the rest of 2017.  End of Q&A Jean-Yves Charlier All right. Thank you, and Andrew, as we’re now slightly over on the time for the call, which is okay, if there are any for any queries or questions, please feel free to contact us at IR here in Amsterdam.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Mattie Singh [ph] from Morgan Stanley.  Unidentified Analyst Just a couple of questions, first on Algeria. Is there any help in understanding when the revenue recovery might be visible, understand that new management has just taken charge but any help in understanding the trends there would be very very appreciated? Secondly, in Bangladesh also, the growth being quite volatile, and do you consider Bangladesh as a growth market but we have hardly active in any revenue growth recently. So if you could explain -- is there any opportunities still left in Bangladesh or we should actually start looking at it as a mature market? Andrew Davies Sure, I'll do that. So let me address Algeria first of all. So I'm not going to give a specific timeline of when we expect to get back to year-on-year revenue stability let alone growth. But here's how I would think about it. We knew that the first quarter of this year was probably going to be our toughest quarter from a year-on-year comparison perspective, simply because it’s the first quarter last year where we made some of the commercial missteps which actually gave us a short-term bulk in pricing effective BUs and therefore revenues and then we started to suffer the customer losses and in particular the high value customer losses from round about the end of first quarter 2016 onwards. We do see a little bit of a gradual sequential progress right now in Algeria, so I would expect that over the course of 2017 that rate of year-on-year decline should diminish. But I still think that we're probably two to four quarters away from actually seeing anything approaching year-on-year revenue stability.  With regards to Bangladesh, as I’ve noted it’s a very competitive market right now. The market has gone through quite a bit of transition, if you will, in the last twelve months. There's been the imposition of these supplementary duties which clearly has increased government revenues but is taking money directly out of the operators’ revenue pool. And then in addition, you had SIM verification exercise and it's been a lot of aggressive competition for new customers following the completion of that SIM verification exercise and then also you’ve had a merger exercise between Robi and Airtel and that also obviously creates a little bit of more competitive tension in the early aftermath.  Jean-Yves Charlier I think you're right and you described the market as being a little volatile right now. However we would not begin to call this a mature market, we still think that there is plenty of revenue growth to come from this market in the medium to long term. And if you look at all of the normal statistics, I mean, user penetration, smartphone penetration, and data usage, they all lag well behind what a mature market would exhibit. So there's a lot more upside to come from Bangladesh. And also we're going to broaden the coverage. With that, we’re still only at a 65% population coverage on the 3G network right now. So there's a lot of customers out there that don't even have the reach of a bundle linked 3G network right now. So I would not characterize this as a mature market.  Unidentified Analyst And quickly on the Russian revenue trend, so if you could explain the decline in the fixed line business and is that a trend we can see continuing during 2017? Andrew Davies Well, as I said in my notes, it’s all driven by U.S. dollar denominated contracts, so roughly between 15% to 20% of the Russia's fixed line customer base has U.S. dollar denominated contract and therefore with the ruble appreciating, that just simply translates into a lower amount of ruble equivalent revenues. I mean that is almost exclusively the driver for the fixed line trend in Russia.  Operator We take our next question from Herve Drouet from HSBC.  Herve Drouet  I’ve got a couple of question as well on my side. The first one is back on Algeria, I understand there's been some change in taxes, VAT, those type of things. I was wondering how and why could you not transfer part of it to the end user? Is it because competition did not signal any willingness to do it? And if it is the case, do you think that can change in the future looking forwards or do you think the current pricing that's to be passed partly to the end subscribers? The second question is on Pakistan, the subscriber acquisition costs increased; could you give a bit more light on the reason what is behind this SAC increase and also on the auctions on the spectrum, and the base price which has been put up $295 million they get; is it for the band you are targeting or is it for all the bands which are being put under auctions? So those are the main questions. Thanks.  Jean-Yves Charlier Andrew, I can take Algeria, you want to do Pakistan? Andrew Davies Sure; why not? Jean-Yves Charlier All right .So on Algeria, in terms of the increased tax and VAT, I think that we found it difficult in the position that Djezzy is in to pass those on to the consumer. I think there's a few issues here to note. First, the third mobile operator, Mobily is extremely aggressive from a pricing point of view. So I think that at this stage very difficult to see ARPU increases there. And secondly, the macroeconomic environment is not good in Algeria and consumer spending is under considerable pressure, particularly with inflation on food and other items. So the contact both competitively and economically did not enable us to pass those increases onto the consumer demand. I don’t know, Andrew, before you address Pakistan if you want to say anything else on Algeria.  Andrew Davies No, nothing else to say, you got it spot on, Jean-Yves. So on Pakistan, Herve, let me address the spectrum question first of all. So there is just one lot of 10 megahertz of paid spectrum in the 1800 megahertz band. Now it's technology neutral, so therefore it’s absolutely within a kind of our process -- is the absolute kind of spectrum that we want to obtain in the country. I didn't quite understand your first question, if I'm completely honest.  Herve Drouet  So basically in term of the pricing with the spectrum because you indicate in your guidance that your underlying equity free cash flow includes, if I well understood, the average annual purchase of spectrum license in the region of around $200 million. So I was wondering -- I mean do you believe what may happen in Pakistan will be included in what you consider to be the average annual purchase of the spectrum license and – or can it also include a potentially as well some spectrum inclusion on Bangladesh or you think it's out of the scope? Andrew Davies Look, clearly the guidance on equity free cash flow for the year assumed that we would spend what’s been our run rate -- average run rate over the last three to four years of $200 million. So clearly to the extent that we spend $295 million or thereabouts in Pakistan, that would -- all of the things being equal, would put a little bit of pressure on the guidance. And obviously we do have the benefit right now of currency tailwinds and there’s a number of other things, well so I don't see as being a grave danger to guidance right now. And as I said as well, I mean to the extent that it happens in a way to bring forward from next year, so really it doesn't affect how we think about the evolution of equity free cash flow over the medium to long term and we are very comfortable with being able to fund it, so with an absolutely zero impact on sustainable and progressive dividend policy that we've announced.  But sorry, I also thought you asked some kind of question related to – Herve Drouet  On the EBITDA margins, I mean so basically on the -- I was wondering I think there was a change on the subscriber acquisition costs. If I would remember, that has a plan –  Jean-Yves Charlier That was in Bangladesh, no Pakistan. Herve Drouet  Yes, in Bangladesh, sorry.  Jean-Yves Charlier Okay, yes, Bangladesh, I mean that's driven simply by a higher level of gross additions following the completion of the SIM verification exercise.

We've been advocating I think of the top three operators that the market really needs to move from voice centric pricing to a data centric pricing. We took early decisions in 2016 to exit the unlimited medium large screen bundled data bundles and as we continue to change our tariff structure we hope that the market is going to follow and hence create I think even further stability and potential, further stability in the revenue growth trends that we've recently seen. So I think that's the context overall. Andrew, you do want to add some details and particularly on the margins? Andrew Davies I think Russia is a good support of margins, for the first quarter --- probably on balance in line with our expectations, and I think you would be fair to say, for the first quarter it's probably going to be slightly easier easier comparisons for us than other quarters because we did have a couple of commercial issues around bad debt costs and overly subsidizing devices in the first quarter of 2016. So I would not get overly carried away with 40 bps to 60 bps improvement in underlying EBITDA in Russia for just one quarter right. There's a lot of hard work to do to stabilize the margins and really radically transform that business, obviously that is across the rest of the group. So I would say that overall we're pleased with where the margins are in the first quarter and I guess we've got roughly across the group 60 bps, organic year on year increase, now that is not adjusted for the leap year, right? When you actually adjust margins for the leap year effect, which obviously is a real thing, you can't lose a day in the quarter and pretend as if nothing happened. The underlying margin growth on a day for day -- life like for likesome databases is actually well over a percentage point year on year. So that's still within the confines of a low single digit accretion guidance for the year. So I think we're pleased with where we are but we're not -- I wouldn't get overly bullish and start thinking that we're going to talk about materially different guidance on margins as we go through the rest of 2017.  End of Q&A Jean-Yves Charlier All right.

Operator Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Verisk Analytics First Quarter 2017 Earnings Results Conference Call. This call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Verisk's EVP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Cohen. Mr. Cohen, please go ahead. David E. Cohen - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thank you, Teresa, and good day to everyone. We appreciate your joining us today for discussion of our first quarter 2017 financial results. With me on the call this morning are Scott Stephenson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Anquillare, Chief Operating Officer; and Eva Huston, Chief Financial Officer. Following comments by Scott, Mark and Eva highlighting some key points about our strategic priorities, the financial performance, we will open up the call for your questions.

Finally, as set forth in more detail, in yesterday's earnings release, today's call may include forward-looking statements about Verisk's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. Now, I will turn the call over to Scott Stephenson. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks, David. Good morning, everybody. Yesterday, we reported an unusual quarter with a number of items that we don't expect to recur that affected us at a moment in time. We are comfortable that growth will be better the rest of the year and into 2018. For the full-year of 2017, we continue to expect combined insurance and financial services revenue to grow about in line within historical trend. Reported revenue grew 2% for the quarter. Organic constant-currency growth was 2.5%. Profitability remained strong, with total EBITDA margins around 49%. We chose to grow expenses at a measured pace in the quarter to support future growth. Diluted adjusted EPS declined about 1% as a result of unusual conditions influencing revenue growth. In spite of this, free cash flow in the quarter was up about 12%. Revenue growth was muted because of one-time true up revenue in Decision Analytics in 2016, several contract completions at Argus and the cycling through of WoodMac contracts that were signed in the depth of the oil commodity down cycle. Looking ahead, our confidence is based on new contracts and new solutions layered on top of the stability our subscription revenue provides. Specifically, we expect new sources of insurance revenue growth, several new Argus contracts where the signing slipped out of the first quarter and moderating effects of the commodity and currency headwinds as we move through 2017. We were pleased that in our resource businesses in the quarter, we saw a healthy and encouraging growth in contract signings for subscription products. Our teams are working hard on all the new solutions in which we are investing and long-term opportunities remain robust. We are focusing on both acquiring talent and shaping our workforce, so that it reflects the right mix of capabilities to run our business. We are also investing in our new solution opportunities, because we're confident in the near and the long-term revenue outlooks, continuing to invest in our people and innovation as the prudent course of action. We were pleased to continue repurchasing our shares through our long-standing program, an indication of our enduring confidence in our business. We bought 1.3 million shares for a total return of capital of $104 million in the quarter. At March 31, 2017, we had $532 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. With leverage below our 2.5 times reference level, we have plenty of capacity to make strategically relevant acquisitions as well as additional repurchases. During the quarter, we spent $76 million on acquisitions, bringing trailing four-quarter total acquisition spend to $150 million. Since last quarter's earnings call, we closed the acquisition of Fintellix, further extending Argus' international end markets and enhancing our capabilities and global bank regulatory compliance. The acquisition of Fintellix positions Argus to expand our data hosting and regulatory platforms and better address the increasingly complex needs of our clients. We will continue to focus on M&A that helps drive our strategy and embodies the Verisk distinctives. At Investor Day in December, we began telling you about 20 internal investment opportunities we are funding to drive valuable solutions for our customers and growth for our company. These are promising new solutions, some of which have the potential to contribute significantly over a five-year time horizon. These major initiatives have their own project champions, at least one anchor customer and dedicated teams. They involve machine learning, telematics, the Internet of Things, high-resolution imagery, predictive fraud modeling, claims automation, digital marketing and alternative energy analytics. While the revenues in most cases will be slower to ramp up, the investments are already underway. We have identified these opportunities, which cross all our key vertical end markets as likely to generate attractive returns over the five-year planning horizon. We intend to move with speed and focus on these compelling innovation opportunities. We're running our game plan of innovation driving organic revenue, which will result in the delivery of free cash flow growth. Our businesses are strongly aligned with the Verisk distinctives of: one, unique data assets; two, deep domain expertise; three, first-to-market innovations; and four, deep integration into our customer workflows. With these come network effects, scale economies and a large percentage of subscription revenue. From this enduring foundation of strength, we are highly confident in the ability of our people to execute our strategy and plans, which ultimately relate to serving and adding value for our customers. You should expect our results to ramp as we move through this year and we are even more encouraged as we look to 2018 and beyond. So with that, I'm going to turn the call over now to Mark for some additional comments. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thank you, Scott. Across our businesses, we serve the property and casualty insurance industry, we have several key themes, including vertical big data, industry automation and digital engagement. While the headline growth across our insurance businesses is a bit below trend during the quarter, both the underlying performance and outlook for the rest of the year and beyond is encouraging. First, growth in the quarter was reduced by last year's true up revenue, which did not recur in 2017. Second and most important, the pricing environment and the competitive landscape remain consistent with the past. Third, as we look at the core solutions in each of our businesses, they're growing well. For example, in our catastrophe modeling business, the dynamics in the reinsurance industry continue to be challenging. That has affected the cap on and consulting businesses. However, as we look at the majority of what we do there, extreme event modeling, we are growing in the high single digits as we continue to take market share. Big data message, integrated into our platform, are very compelling to the industry. Looking at our claims businesses, our two largest solutions related to repair cost estimate continue to grow in the mid to high single-digits. This is a good example of continuing industry automation. And of course, fraud is evergreen, helping our anti-fraud related solutions continue to grow nicely. As a final example, in our personal lines underwriting business, where our solutions are well-established, but still newer to the market than some of our competitors, we're making good progress in innovating and gaining market share. We're applying big data methods, which we expect will be a key differentiator even as we help our customers digitally engage more effectively with their customers. Finally, in our important heritage ISO business, our normal course price increases went into effect in January and we're pleased with the uptake of our newer solutions. While many of you may think of the ISO solutions business as a steady, stable grower, which it is, we're really excited with the addition of new people who are helping us push forward with innovative solutions. These are allowing us to address parts of the end market where we haven't historically served, but where we see a lot of opportunity to help our customers solve tough problems they face. As we look at some of the newer things we're doing, including expanding into international markets and with the recent acquisition, there's a lot which is very encouraging. With that, let me turn it over to Eva to cover our financial results in more detail. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thank you, Mark. In the first quarter, we grew revenue and EBITDA on a comparable basis to the prior year, while also investing in solutions with meaningful long-term potential revenue streams. Our growth in the quarter was below trend as several headwinds affected us at the same time, consistent with our comments on our fourth quarter call and in presentations earlier this year. Currency hurt revenue results in the quarter by about $7.5 million. As we move through the year, we're confident that revenues will improve. Revenue in the quarter grew 2%. Organic constant currency revenue grew 2.5% and 3.4%, excluding the prior year true up revenue. We have included a new table in the press release to help you see the acquisition and FX results for each of our revenue lines more clearly. As a reminder, organic constant currency growth excludes the contribution from recent acquisitions and reflects current period exchange rates applied to prior period revenue. Total acquired revenue in the quarter was $5.3 million. Within the Decision Analytics segment, revenue grew 0.1%. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 1.5%. This quarter, insurance was the fastest growing vertical and also the largest contributor of dollars to growth. Underlying the results are the continued resilience in our insurance business and some timing in our financial services revenue growth. Decision Analytics insurance revenue grew 4.1% in the quarter. Last year, had around $4 million of one-time true-up revenue. And adjusting for this, organic constant currency revenue growth was 6.5%. Growth was led by strong performance in underwriting solutions, claims analytics, loss qualification, and catastrophe modeling solutions also contributed to growth in the quarter. We've spoken about reinsurance having an impact in some areas in terms of growth, but we are pleased that those trends aren't worsening and that the underlying growth in our subscription solutions and cap modeling remains very good, as Mark mentioned. Customer retention remains very high and we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver growth. Energy and specialized markets category revenue declined 5.9% in the quarter. On an organic constant currency basis, revenue declined 2.1%. While continued energy end market headwinds and the British pound impacted revenue in the quarter, as expected, both of those trends have started to improve. The benefits will be over time, given the multi-year subscription nature of the majority of that business. The WoodMac team continues to do a great job managing the business to outstanding relative performance. The category revenue growth was reduced also by a decline in environmental health and safety solutions due to lower demand following the late 2015 completion of GHS standard-related implementation. Financial services revenue declined 0.5% in the quarter. The recent acquisition of Fintellix closed on March 31 and is contributing to revenue in the second quarter. Strong growth in media effectiveness and good growth in core banking solutions were offset by a couple of long-term government customers and a non-core customer who concluded their contracts in the fourth quarter. Those combined contracts contributed about $11 million for the full year 2016. Additionally, we typically see a seasonal step-down after Q4, which did occur this year as well. We remain optimistic about delivering growth in 2017 and building on what is a great dataset and analytic capability. Risk Assessment revenue grew 5.4% in the quarter. Organic constant currency revenue growth was 4.2%. The stable growth demonstrates the value to our longstanding insurance customers as well as contributions of new solutions that are in early stages and the recent acquisitions. Industry-standard insurance programs revenue grew 5.9%, reflecting our 2017 invoices and continued contribution from newer solutions such as predictive models and Electronic Rating Content. While still early, we're encouraged by the strong efforts to drive new product development in this part of the business. Our property-specific rating and underwriting information revenue increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth was led by subscription revenues. We have some components of this line that are purchased transactionally, which is where we are seeing more variation. EBITDA decreased 1.1% in the quarter to $246 million. The reported decline was a result of timing of revenue related to operating expenses, legal and acquisition costs, and the prior year true-up revenue in Decision Analytics insurance that occurred in the quarter. The combined cost of revenue and SG&A increased 5.9% or $15 million in the quarter. The increase was just 3.3% on an organic basis as we continue to manage expenses. EBITDA margins as reported were 48.9%. Margins were reduced by about 80 basis points due to acquisitions and about 60 basis points due to legal and transaction fees in the quarter. Total acquired revenue – sorry – total acquired EBITDA in the quarter was break-even. Acquisitions we're doing are close to the core with well-defined paths to top-line growth and margin expansion. Margins were also impacted in the quarter by our decision to grow expenses to support a multi-year view of revenue expectations as well as investment opportunities we've been discussing with you. Margins by segment were affected by rebalancing of our technology resources to reflect internal priorities as our Decision Analytics businesses expand the data sources they own and that serve as the foundation for their solutions. Our data storage needs are growing. Reported interest expense was $28 million in the quarter. Total debt was $2.3 billion at March 31, 2017. Our leverage at the end of the first quarter was 2.2 times, below our 2.5 times reference level. Our reported effective tax rate in the quarter was 32.5%. Adjusted net income in Q1 decreased 1.6% to $125 million. The average diluted share count was 170.2 million in the quarter and we bought about 1.3 million shares in the quarter at an average price of $81.24. Our repurchase program has been successful to-date, generating annualized IRRs above our cost of capital. On March 31, 2017, our diluted share count was 169.4 million shares. Adjusted EPS on a fully diluted basis was $0.74 in the quarter, a decrease of 1.3%. Diluted adjusted EPS from continuing operations decreased because the quarter's unusually modest revenue growth was more than offset by a higher tax rate and currency effects. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $318 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of 12.8%. Capital expenditures increased 22.9% to $31 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. CapEx was 6.2% of revenue year-to-date. Free cash flow increased 11.8% to $287 million for the three-month period ended March 31. Free cash flow was 116.7% of EBITDA as we continue to collect more cash in our seasonally strong Q1. Growth in free cash flow was driven by strong working capital management, highlighting an important aspect of our business model. Free cash flow remains an important metric for measurement of driving enterprise and, therefore, shareholder value. As you think about your models for 2017, currency will continue to be a headwind in 2Q, moderating a bit as we move into the second half based on current exchange rates. To help you look at the FX impact, the following 2016 total revenues are restated at the March 31, 2017 rate. If rates were unchanged from March 31, 2017, these would be the base for the organic constant-currency revenue growth for the remainder of the year. Most of the FX impact falls within the energy and specialized revenue line items in Decision Analytics. For 2Q 2016, the revenue would have been $490 million versus the reported $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million versus the reported $498 million, and for Q4 2016, the revenue would have been $505 million versus the reported $506 million. You'll also recall that merit increases go into effect April 1, which typically creates a seasonal step-up in the expense base. So there's a natural step-down in margins from Q1 to Q2, all else being equal. The net of many of these factors is that we continue to expect growth to improve as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. In addition, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization of $130 million to $135 million, up from what we expected last quarter as we were able to move projects into service faster than we had planned and amortization of intangibles of about $95 million. Based on our current debt balances and interest rates, we expect interest expense to be around $113 million. This includes non-cash amortization of debt issuance costs. We estimate the tax rate will be in the range of 32% to 33%. And in the adjusted net income calculation, we will continue to use 26% for the tax effect on intangible amortization. And finally, we expect the diluted weighted average share count of about 171.2 million shares. We look forward to ramping results through 2017 and beyond. We're excited about the opportunities to invest as we work to drive long-term free cash flow. We remain confident that we have the financial strength and capital structure to support investments for the long-term. We also continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit your questions to one and one follow up. And with that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. First I guess, just want to follow-up on Scott's comment that, I think you said for the full year you expect insurance and financial services to grow consistent with history. But I think you also – given the loss of those contracts, can you help us understand – I guess more specifically, what you mean by consistent with history? And I guess, can you see Argus get back to the growth rates? I mean, that implies a pretty significant growth rate, so any more color, I guess, on the recovery from here? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Right. Well, one of the things to know about Argus is that it is sort of, I would say, a constantly dynamic environment in the sense that we are able to and are reaching out to new customers consistently. And so the right way to think about the business is that the customer list grows. There were these rotations of the government customers that we noted for you. But it is a dynamic set of customers, as well as a dynamic set of offerings where the media effectiveness solutions are really finding their mark. And so it will be a combination of new names on the customer list and increased levels of spending with customers that are already on the customer list. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And I guess mathematically, I think in the past, insurance and financial services have combined to grow kind of 7% to 8% the last few years. Is that the number that you're thinking of? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, that's exactly what we're saying. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC And is that an organic or including some of the acquisitions? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Organic. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird. Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. On financial services, it seems like growth or revenues maybe more dependent on large projects than I previously appreciated. So just – how much – how many large projects or what's the exposure to large projects do you still have in the revenue base there? And I heard that some slipped out of Q1, but just what's the visibility into the pipeline? And then I guess more importantly, how do you think about the long-term growth rate for Argus? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So let me start with sort of the second question first, Jeff. We remain very positive about Argus' intermediate and long-term growth. The strength of where we start from, which is a very unique insight into patterns of consumer spending, we are continuing to find very good ways to commercialize that. And we're also finding ways to take the platform and expand it overseas. And so those trends are going to continue, basically. And so we feel very good about the growth profile. There is – as companies become – I mean, our customers become more aware of and aligned to the opportunity that they have to make use of these newer kinds of data analytics that they haven't made use of before, there are moment in time effects where they kind of get into the new methods and so, you do tend to get a bit more lumpiness when that happens. It's really just the nature of the beast. And the rotations out by, for example, the government customers, I think are very, very specific to their situations and their conditions and really don't reflect the overall commercial potential of what's here. But there is that effect even inside of what end up looking like subscription revenues because there is sort of a moment in time at which customers get into the new methods and that will sort of create a lump of revenue at a moment in time. Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. And then in terms of the moderating industry headwinds that you called out, I heard Eva's comment about reinsurance, I guess stabilizing, but could you just broadly characterize your view of the insurance end market right now? So I guess reinsurance stabilizing, but what are your thoughts on other areas of the insurance ecosystem headwinds getting better, worse, stable, et cetera? Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Sure. This is Mark. Good question. So let me start with the reinsurance side of things. So clearly, it's a very soft market from a reinsurance perspective, which puts pressure on our customers. That remains. At the same time, what we have highlighted is there's a lot of industry consolidations. When industry consolidations happen that also commonly interacts with our contracts with what is now one as opposed to two entities. That headwind has kind of almost cycled through. So that's good news with regard to cycling through. We've addressed kind of those concerns and how we want to contract with customers going forward and what we're also seeing is some volumes back into what I'll refer to as the securitization market. We see customers kind of ramping up to continue to do business as they always have. And as they look to expand and as they look to basically grow their businesses, both on the insurance side as well as the reinsurance side. They're looking at new avenues, whether it's cyber as an example. How are they going to move their books to new, what I'll refer to, is casualty-type of extreme events. So that's a good, constructive approach for the industry and we're kind of on the cutting edge with a lot of that. So that's a positive. I would say to you that I don't see a lot of dramatic change inside the insurance industry, except for the ones I've highlighted in the past. There is a tremendous amount of technology – InsureTech that is happening. People are installing new systems. They're transitioning over. They're really looking to do the big data analytics thing. They're really looking to do digital engagement because people expect kind of better online engagement, like they would with an Amazon or when they're buying product on the web. All of that has created a nice opportunity for us to get involved in those – kind of those projects to redefine how they want to see the future. So, tough time, but good opportunities for us in light of the changes happening. So... Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you, both. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. My first question is, I guess in the past, you've given your expectations for insurance in that same 7% to 8% camp. And then financial or Argus in the mid-teens. And now, you're sort of grouping them together and giving that guidance and from the comments, it sounded like you already reiterated your confidence in Argus. And so is the missing piece here then the natural insurance slowdown until all your investable opportunities, whatever, start coming to fruition? Is that how we should think of it? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. No. Manav, it's Eva. Maybe I'll just take it up a level just – as – I know, we always try to have discussions at very detailed levels. But fundamentally, I think what we're trying to tie our confidence to in the statements that Scott made around insurance and financial combined and the growth targets we have there is, we've made comments in the past about our overall long-term growth targets organically for Verisk Analytics. And the statement that Scott made ties very closely to that. Obviously, at the current moment in time, energy's at a moment where it's not at those levels. I think we've talked about that. I think the team is doing a great job. So really, how we've dimensioned it, I would think about it that way because we're – as Wood Mackenzie works through the energy cycle and is doing a great job, putting in that overall bucket at the moment in time would not be appropriate. So that's really what we're trying to message when we're talking about those two on a combined basis. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay, got it. And then Scott, of those 20 opportunities, you mentioned a bunch of the different, I guess, bigger headlights and what – the stuff you're working on there. I mean, I think we've heard of telematics and imagery before, but is there any hierarchy or any sort of opportunity that stands out more than the others? Because some of the stuff like you mentioned like machine learning and Internet of Things seem fairly broad. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Well, the way that we're going to provide for our growth near and long-term actually is to operate on a number of fronts. And you've got some themes like Internet of Things broadly, like cyber as a theme, where the use cases, the path to commercialization is still sort of emerging. But that doesn't mean that the ideas are anything other than very good ideas and ones that we feel like we have special contributions to make. But in the sort of intermediate term, two themes that are – the ones that you've heard us talk about a lot, actually, and we really do have a lot of enthusiasm for are the interpretation of remote imagery, which we think is a very important theme for any number of reasons, including remote imagery and the interpretation of it can apply across multiple verticals and actually, multiple geographies. And the other one that I would point to is, in fact, telematics and especially vehicle telematics, where we just – we are – we can see, in our own experience, sort of the rising volumes of data and the increasing attention to those datasets and those analytics among our existing customer base. So, you've heard us talk about those two a lot. But that doesn't mean that they're tired in any sense. In fact, we think we're kind of in the early stages of both of those being important inside of our business. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the energy business, could you remind us what percent of your contracts are sort of multiyear? And do you see energy getting worse here or is that just primarily currency? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, so on the first question, I would say, it's roughly half that are multiyear. And I think we've talked about in the past how we pick moments in time where we're responsive to customers and also market conditions where we choose to pull those out or shorten those. And what I would say is just with regards to WoodMac, we do continue, just in the reported results, to see some lag effect from the customer management in previous periods. But as we look at the business signing today, we're really seeing good growth in renewal signings, cross-sell, we have existing products. We have new solutions added from acquisitions over the past year or so. So we like how the year is shaping up so far. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. And then just a question on capital allocation, leverage is pretty low. It doesn't seem like there's any significant scale deals outside of the current verticals that you're in. Maybe if you could just frame for us your appetite to put on a dividend here, given your highly reoccurring revenue base, and with regard to that, the $100 million buyback. Is that a run rate we should expect going forward? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So, let me start with that. Eva might want to add a little something to this. But I want to go back to kind of the premise of your question. We actually have always seen the M&A program as being sort of the complement to our program of internal investment. One of the values that we believe that we bring to our investors that is unique is that we have hundreds of people walking the halls of our customers on a daily basis. And being in such close contact with our customers, we're able to see the solutions that are making a difference for them. First and foremost, our own, of course. But, we're actually able to see other third parties and knowing where we think value lies and what our strategy is about and having this intelligence in terms of what else is going on in the market, we will always lean into the program of M&A. And in fact, if anything, we've really redoubled our efforts to enlist everybody to be a part of the M&A team. And so, we don't see it as a world, a situation where there isn't opportunity. In fact, we think that there is opportunity. So I just needed to start with that because the way that we think about capital, we certainly care deeply about deploying capital effectively. The program of M&A has been highly productive for our investors and we believe that it will continue to be. We're very comfortable returning capital and we've done so and we've done so steadily. Whatever is the right way to deploy capital is what we're going to do on behalf of our shareholders. To-date, it has not occurred to us that a dividend was necessarily a part of that mix. We ask the question routinely. We'll continue to ask the question. But so far, I think you've seen in our behavior that we're not only comfortable returning capital in the form of buybacks, but we have done so and I think you should continue to expect us to do so. So there will be a balance there. There always has been a balance there and there always will be a balance there. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And maybe just to answer your specific question about run rate, I think just tying into how Scott described our capital allocation, our first filter that we look for is buying interesting companies that meet our distinctives that add to growth, that add to customer solution. And then after that filter is put in place, the next filter is our stock repurchase program and that's going to be keyed off, as it always has been, the value of the stock at the moment in time and we are managing that not to accretion/dilution, but rather actually to the returns like our investors would as well. So when you ask about run rate, we don't actually design our program as a run rate program. It's going to be a function of that initial filter around M&A and obviously, I think, as you know, M&A isn't sort of quarter-by-quarter, you chunk it in. And so that repurchase rate will vary across the year depending upon what that filter and what that pipeline looks like. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. Thank you so much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Hi. Good morning. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Morning. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about Verisk and my experience with the company, I would describe the business, insurance business generally, as being relatively unexposed or underexposed, I guess, to insurance end market fundamentals. I wonder if you can comment, sort of qualitatively on whether or not you think (35:59) changed and accordingly would it – does it influence the type of products you're developing, the time to market, our expectations for return on the investments you've been making and so forth. So I appreciate the comment on the reacceleration of revenue growth. I just wonder if there's something that's sort of fundamentally changed in the relationship between Verisk's insurance business and the end markets it serves. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. No, we really don't think that and as you would imagine, we actually are very alert to that and would be quite sensitive if we thought there was something there. But, no, actually, I mean, if you look at industry structure, there – I mean there's like one larger merger that is sort of in the process of ratcheting through. And as we've discussed many times on these calls and in other forums, when something like that occurs, where those two companies are concerned, there may be a moment in time, adjustment. But, yes, I mean that's kind of normal course business from our perspective. And the regulatory environment really is not changing. It's not particularly dynamic. And so kind of from that perspective, the environment in which we do our business is more or less the same. When I talk to the chief executives of other insurance companies, as I do routinely, what they are really about is changing their methods and trying to find ways to grow their businesses. That's fundamentally what they're giving attention to. And we stand in that stream of activity for them. Do they have healthy amounts of self-respect and want to make sure that they're getting ultimate value from a partner like us and do they like to talk to us about the invoices that we send them, et cetera? Sure. And they always have. But I don't really think – if you go back 15 years, you could find moments when premiums went up pretty substantially year-over-year. That has not recurred for quite some time now. So our mission is the same as it's always been, which is to do a fantastic job of relating to our customers and bringing them new sources of value. I think they're as open to that as they've ever been. I think that we are more innovative than we've ever been. And that's really what's going to determine the outcome as we go forward. I will say, we definitely need to keep our feet moving. Their issues modify and change and we need to be right there as they do. So it's not a question of staying where we are. We have to be extremely energetic. But I don't think anything has changed in terms of our standing with them. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. And if I play devil's advocate and say, okay, Verisk has been investing in a lot of these new solutions, which I think you enumerated, Scott, for a while, and you just had a tough quarter with some external pressure. Why is it now that all of a sudden, at least it feels that way from the outside looking in, some of these new solutions gain traction? Are there specific contracts or customers to which you can point that create sort of a coincidental inflection point in the growth from some of these new offerings? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Well, that is why we have the view that we have of the rest of 2017 and beyond. As we know specifically what is going on in the business, specific customers, specific contracts and so, yes, I mean that's – whenever we're reporting to you, whenever we make a forward-looking statement, it's on that basis. That's how we think about our business. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. I'll give a little color, if it's helpful. One of the things that we try to always do is take a look at what's committed from the standpoint of contracts, what's implementing, when and I think what we've seen is two things. About 2/3 of our kind of need for revenue growth is committed in the form of kind of contracted price escalation, contracted new products, contracted new customers and what remains is kind of a new sale type of target that is reasonable in light of what we've done in the past and reasonable in light of what we have in our pipeline. So we continue to feel good about the full year. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Thanks very much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Operator And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning, everyone. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Good morning. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC So, I just wanted to get delve a little bit more into Mark's good feelings about the rest of the year. So if we ended up at about, let's see look, so (41:01) 2.5% organic growth in Q1, you adjust for the true up, it will probably be about 3.3%. So, I wanted to ask about the pace of acceleration towards that 7% to 8% target and the 7% to 8% target being the level at which all businesses are firing on all cylinders. And are we thinking you could get there at the end of 2017? Or maybe we're thinking more of the end of 2018? I'm just trying to get a sense for the pace of the acceleration. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Just to reiterate, that was a 2017 comment. So just to say it again, the rate of organic growth for our combined insurance and financial services businesses we think will be on a historic trend, in that 7% to 8% range for the full year. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And as it relates to insurance, I'll reiterate to the extent that we think of the incremental growth that we need, about 2/3 of it, we believe, are committed in the form of contract with 1/3 or so of this incremental being, let's go, get it and that's new sales. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And just to wrap on, I think you're asking a question about ramp, I think you know the nature of our business where we have a large portion of subscription contracts which is a real positive for us, but that also means is a subscription starts July 1, that starts contributing then. So naturally, as you layer in subscriptions, that layers into the growth across the rest of the year. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the international expansion opportunity. You've talked in the past about an opportunity in banking, also an opportunity in insurance. I want to know if we could get an update on that and also maybe talk a little bit about how cloud receptivity by the client base is playing into that. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So first of all, with respect to international, there are some – we're presenting differently internationally than we used to. WoodMac has always been international. But I'm – and actually, Argus has always had a strong dimension of that. But the – I just want to underline the Fintellix acquisition and the additional reach that that provides to the Argus franchise, which is a really good news. Over on the insurance side, we are presenting credentials and presenting solutions at a level and to a set of customers that we kind of haven't before, basically. I mean we were aware of them. They were aware of us, but we are now in a position to be able to make large proposals to name brand companies. We've always been able to do that in the reinsurance vertical. But now in the insurance vertical, we are increasingly positioned to be able to do that. It's really very exciting, actually. Nothing is going to occur overnight in vertical data analytic lands the way that we do things. But we are quite encouraged actually by what's going on there. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Scott, I was hoping if it's okay to look back to 2016. Looking back to early 2016, Verisk thought the insurance vertical, in total, would accelerate for full year 2016 and then later, contract starts seemed to slip and the insurance vertical didn't accelerate for full year 2016 and so what I want to know is the contract wins that you got from last year that you thought would ramp and then didn't ramp, are they ramping now? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. It's all a part of the overall view that we gave you. I mean, we've got thousands of customers. And it's depending upon which part of our company we're talking about. But so the effect, the overall effect in our business is the accumulation of a lot of different things that are going on. But fundamentally, the relationships with the existing customers are as strong as ever. We are pushing out internationally, which isn't yet an overwhelming effect but it's positive, it's constructive, and new solutions continue to find their way. And it's really at the intersection of all those things that our results occur. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to go back to the stream of new products. How should we think about the relative commercial impact of the new products you're currently developing or rolling out across the insurance business, as compared to the classic products you developed and rolled out over the last three years? I'm wondering if there are just fewer home runs left to hit in that market. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. No. I don't feel that way at all. In fact, I think some of the newer solutions have probably above average potential. And it may – those of you who have sort of been with us for a while, if we keep saying the same things like remote imagery analytics and Telematics that may sound like there's nothing new there. In data analytic land, particularly in vertical market data analytic land, it takes a while to get to the inflection point. And then you get to the inflection point. And so, that's effectively the dynamic that work inside of our business. So, don't misunderstand us going back to the same themes and as you try to interpret our growth in any particular time period, you may be trying to sort of create sort of a 1:1 equivalence. Solutions, when they finally find their mark, actually have an unusual inflection relative to where they began. And so, as you would imagine, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, we're working on this absolutely as hard as we can to get established as well as feeding the pipeline with additional new solutions. I don't – it's not the case that the newer solutions have lesser potential than those that maybe we developed three to five years ago. I don't know if you want to add to that, Mark. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Only thing I was going to highlight, too, is I think we have a preference. I'd assume our colleague from the phone do that. We would prefer a subscription-type model. So as opposed to kind of going at it from a transactional perspective, we'd like to create longer-term contracts with customers and the revenue rec on that flow (47:57). So that is a way we feel that they'll use us for all of their transactions as opposed to selected ones, if you were to try to price it on a transaction. So maybe a little bit of a patient philosophy, but that's the way we typically worked up the side of the (48:14) solutions into our revenue mix. Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. And in the Investor Day in December, you talked about a $2 billion TAM for Argus. I'm wondering if there are opportunities for you to go after that market in a bigger way with incremental investments in sales and new product development or perhaps more transformative M&A. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Sort of reverse order on your question. The acquisition of Fintellix for example, we really do believe it puts us on a different foot in global markets. And there are other solutions other – I would call them kind of point solutions, data analytic point solutions that relate strongly to things that we already today that we are interested in thinking about. And that would be a combination of buy and build. But otherwise, the way that the Argus business advances is basically, we present credentials to companies that aren't customers. They find out the speed with which they can begin to commercialize the insight that we bring them from a data analytic perspective. So in a sense, I agree with the tone of your question in that the more that we can do to present credentials to an ever-expanding set of customers, the more of that we can do the better. That said, I think we've got a great team and I think we're doing a good job with that. But we're always leaning into how can we take this wonderful platform and leverage it? Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Appreciate the color. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Operator And your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the margin outlook. Have you adjusted the cost based on the slow start? And how much of the margin outlook is dependent on the growth this year? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Well, thanks for the question. I think as I've mentioned, as we're talking through the quarter, we were modest in the growth in the quarter. Expenses grew about 3.3%. We are within that investing in the new solutions and also making sure that we've got the capacity as revenue ramps. So, I guess the way I would think about it is, we don't manage those expenses quarter-by-quarter because we are managing for the long-term growth. Certainly, as – if you see revenue ramp, that's helpful to margins as we go through the year. But what we want to make sure that we're not doing is that we're not being reactive to unusual, short-term events and disadvantaging ourselves for the long-term. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. And then on the energy front, how much of the rebound is dependent on oil prices and CapEx versus selling the new solutions? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. It's a mix of both. But when we talk about pricing and we talk about the energy business, it's not the case that there's this one to one correspondence between what the price of the commodity does and our growth opportunity. It is true that there has been – the shape of the price curve over the course of the last couple of years is one that hasn't been seen for several decades. It's a very unusual moment. Actually, if you think about it, the WoodMac business, there were two once in a generation things that have happened in the course of the last two years. One is that, the shape of the price curve is extremely unusual. And the other is Britain exited the EU, and the effect that it's had on their currency. Those are two real big effects, both of which are relatively difficult to foresee. In spite of all that, actually, I think the strength of WoodMac is seen more than it has ever been. But back to your specific point, I think that what you need is – what we need is essentially where we're getting to, which is a stable environment, one where our resource company customers are making money and leaning into investments on the front foot, basically. And they got, understandably, very defensive beginning late in 2014 when several of them had to borrow money to pay their dividends. So, these very, very major macro effects. But as they wash out, one of the things about Verisk is we're in the business of growing faster than the underlying markets – vertical markets that we serve. And we've essentially always done that. We've been doing that, 2016, 2017 we will – I mean that's who we are, that's what we do. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you. Operator And your next question is from the line of Arash Soleimani of KBW. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Thanks. A couple questions. So first, I just wanted to ask, within energy and specialized, how much of the decline came from WoodMac versus environmental health and safety? And then just continuing on that question, how much of that was subscription versus transactional? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. So if you were to look in the segment, you're right. Those are the two key pieces within there. Obviously, WoodMac is a larger business than our environmental health and safety business. Although I would say that in the quarter, its performance was better than that smaller business. So there's sort of a balance between the two. As I said earlier, we still have some lag effects from previous periods in WoodMac. I mean, that's the nature of subscription businesses. And so that did contribute to a bit of the decline in the quarter. Also remember, you've got – we've got a lot of numbers in front of you. Now you've got three different growth rates per line, so if you're looking at the absolute reported, the currency effect from WoodMac would be the largest impact. And I think I talked about that $7.5 million in the quarter. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Thanks. And then I have a question that's probably very, very, very long-term in nature. But just as we look at technology that's making cars safer and that ultimately will even make cars drive themselves, which will increase safety even more, that could have a very negative impact on auto premiums longer term. I'm just curious how that impacts Verisk. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Let me take that on. I mean clearly, that's on the minds of our personal lines of writers. The insurance industry as a whole, I think has a view that that's going to make for a safer long-term environment for people on the road. It can save a million or more lives per year. And I think there's some views out there, you can kind of do your own research that, now, the personal auto premium could be something that looks at maybe half of what it is today. I think those customers are looking to ways to kind of reimagine their business and I think a lot of it has to do with moving into what I'll call small commercial lines, so micro business owners work on the cyber side of things. That very much fits our model. That's very helpful. They want to try to move into what is kind of a personal lines flow, meaning just, do it in an expert way without people involved, and they want to move that concept, which is on the personal lines side, to commercial. So those fit well into what we're trying to help them do that. The other thing I think we should just remember as a whole, a large part of the risk throughout the world is either uninsured or underinsured. And I think that's the biggest opportunity for the industry as a whole. There's a need there and I think the industry needs to find ways to ensure what is a very, very large market opportunity with better analytics and ways to assess that risk. So longer-term, bigger picture, but (56:17). Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. I would just add that one of the things that will always be the case is, almost regardless of the size of the segment, the participants will still need to understand where they stand relative to the overall marketplace and part of what we do is we really help get a handle on what's affecting that whole space and also the relativity – excuse me, the relativities between the players. That will be an enduring need. So it's not just the scale of the market. It's also the need to pick apart what's going on in the market. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Thank you very much for the answers. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Sure. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hey, guys, morning. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Morning. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Hi, Henry. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to make sure I understand in terms of the trends in insurance and the Decision Analytics side. I understand there's a number of moving parts in terms of the revenue growth. Just from an earnings growth perspective, is that tracking sort of in line with the organic growth post – or excluding the true-up revenue. And as a follow-up to that, in terms of the ramp-up that you expect from the new products in insurance, is that also a ramp up that you expect in earnings as well? Thanks. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So, there are a couple questions in there. So maybe just to start with, I think your first question is when you say profitability, I presume you're speaking on an EBITDA level. And what I would say is – I mean, what you see across the company is, we're managing expense growth to both fund the existing solutions as well as new ones and I would say that's the same within insurance. So I don't think you'd see dramatically different trends if you were to sort of parse apart the profitability by vertical because we are investing across all of the verticals. I would also note that in the acquisition front, there are a number of new acquisitions. In the quarter, those were essentially across all the acquisitions breakeven. Those are things that we're clicking into our existing business and we think that those margins will ramp. So you have those two effects within the margin. And then I think your second question was with regards to new products and the profitability of those as those sort of click in. Generally, similar to the rest of our solutions, the whole idea of build it once, sell it a lot of times. The more you put on the top-line, the greater the profitability expands. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything additional about any of the specific solutions we're working on there. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. So I think we were trying to address this a little bit before. I think we are seeing uptake in some of the remote imagery. I think we're seeing some uptake in our customers with telematics. I think we have good growth and opportunities internationally the way we contracted around that will be probably more subscription that it is on the transactional perspective. So as that uptake is more of a second-half story, we would also see that as hopefully helping margins because what happens here is we've already invested in or investing in a solution. So it's just the overall dynamic of the nature of our business. Yes, there is a lot of costs that are there and they'll remain because we're investing and once we start the uptake in revenues, there's not a lot of variable incremental cost sales. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Operator And your next question is from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you folks spoke to some of the contract signings slipping out of 1Q for your energy customers. Is that just timing randomness perhaps, or is this indicative of the end market that continues to stabilize? Just wondering if there's anything particular we should be taking away from that anecdote. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, the comment was about the financial services segment, not the energy segment. And no, there is – it really was just timing. Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay, got you. And then another question on the 20 opportunities, Scott, asked slightly differently. Realizing these are longer-term opportunities, would it be fair to say that the internal augmentation or development focus is also primarily on remote imagery and telematics? Perhaps, if you can offer any color on which ones you've made the most progress recently aside from their good market traction. Thanks. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, it really is remote imagery and telematics. Those are the places where they both represent very large opportunities and places where we're seeing commercial response to what it is we're doing. So we've talked about those a lot. We continue – we will continue for years to talk about those a lot because they're just that important. But there are a lot of things on the list of 20 that are very exciting across all the segments. And some of them are domestically-based. Some of them are globally-based. They all really rely on advanced data analytic methods and in many cases, are being founded on new kinds of contributory data, unique data that will help us to do things we think others won't be able to. So it's an exciting agenda basically. You get to a list like that by being close to your customers and understanding where their needs are going. Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. Operator And your next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Eva, kind of housekeeping one. Could – you were going kind of quick there when you were giving the adjusted Q2, Q3, Q4 2016 revenues. I was wondering if you could repeat that. (62:32) the $490 million, $505 million. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Sorry if I was going too quick on that. So, just to repeat, if we look to 2Q 2016 and restated it to today's currency rates, that would have been $490 million. The reported number was $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million. The reported number was $498 million. And for Q4 2016, it would have been $505 million, and the reported number was $506 million. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Okay. And can I just – did that also exclude the true-up – the true-up was in the Q1 of 2016, correct? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Correct. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Okay. All right. That was my... Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And that was just the reported number total translated at the currency rate. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Yeah. That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Operator And your next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC. Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hi. This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I'll be quick. I guess, just the timing of the Argus contract, I guess, for the deals, have those been signed already in the quarter? And I guess, are those new contracts with existing customers or were they – some of those tied to some of the contracts that were completed in Q1? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Those are existing customers. And as we do multiple things for our customers, there is a layering of that. But I think, as Scott said, it's a timing issue and we feel comfortable and confident with that work moving forward. Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, with the energy and Wood Mackenzie, obviously, there is still some lag from some of your customers and the multi-year deals rolling over. I guess, can you kind of give us some more color on whether you're seeing greater demand or usage in various regions or some of the pricing terms? Are you guys looking to lock in into more longer-term deals? Or maybe just give us some more commentary on some of the improving trends you mentioned. Thanks. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Well, a couple of different things in there. One is the customer set continues to expand, as we've shared with you. The solution set continues to expand also where we're – you've sort of known us as the people that can describe the global supply curve, which is extremely valuable and very hard to do and a very, very nice sort of starting place – a strong place to stand. What we will get increasingly good at is and more of our business will be about is the underlying technical conditions and helping our customers sort of navigate those as well. With respect to pricing trends, we're always just – the WoodMac product set as all of our product sets, we're always stuffing more value in there. And that's one of the things that is productive where pricing is concerned. So you've got that effect. So, basically, new solutions, new customers and improving environment where pricing is concerned. That's basically going to be the WoodMac story going forward. The currency effects will wash out. And I do think that we'll see where this is the kind of thinking we're doing, but it may be that as the environment is improving, we may actually want to be a little lighter on our feet and actually sort of pull in the length of the contract so that we can – as things move, we can actually enjoy it more in real time. Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC Makes sense. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. My first question on the energy revenue, I know we've asked a number on this already but as you mentioned that there were some contracts signed the depths (66:20) of the market and there's a lag nature to them. I guess, I wanted to specifically ask, are we therefore at the end of the worst of these lag contracts and you should actually see revenue growth improve? Or is that something will be playing through for the rest of the year and therefore, growth really shouldn't pick up until closer to 2018? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. We would expect improvement as the year progresses. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And I guess, one housekeeping question. Just on the M&A contribution from Fintellix, if you are sharing that as we build our models? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Typically, for the smaller deals, we don't share that in advance. It will come in April 1. So you'll see the numbers as we report in 2Q. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Thank you. Operator And there are no further questions. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. Appreciate all the questions and interest in the company. And we will be back – and we'll be talking with many of you between now and then but certainly look forward to giving you our second quarter report in the near future. Thank you for your time today.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Tim McHugh of William Blair. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Yes. Thanks. First I guess, just want to follow-up on Scott's comment that, I think you said for the full year you expect insurance and financial services to grow consistent with history. But I think you also – given the loss of those contracts, can you help us understand – I guess more specifically, what you mean by consistent with history? And I guess, can you see Argus get back to the growth rates? I mean, that implies a pretty significant growth rate, so any more color, I guess, on the recovery from here? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Right. Well, one of the things to know about Argus is that it is sort of, I would say, a constantly dynamic environment in the sense that we are able to and are reaching out to new customers consistently. And so the right way to think about the business is that the customer list grows. There were these rotations of the government customers that we noted for you. But it is a dynamic set of customers, as well as a dynamic set of offerings where the media effectiveness solutions are really finding their mark. And so it will be a combination of new names on the customer list and increased levels of spending with customers that are already on the customer list. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And I guess mathematically, I think in the past, insurance and financial services have combined to grow kind of 7% to 8% the last few years. Is that the number that you're thinking of? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, that's exactly what we're saying. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC And is that an organic or including some of the acquisitions? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Organic. Timothy McHugh - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Jeff Meuler of Baird. Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. On financial services, it seems like growth or revenues maybe more dependent on large projects than I previously appreciated. So just – how much – how many large projects or what's the exposure to large projects do you still have in the revenue base there? And I heard that some slipped out of Q1, but just what's the visibility into the pipeline? And then I guess more importantly, how do you think about the long-term growth rate for Argus? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So let me start with sort of the second question first, Jeff. We remain very positive about Argus' intermediate and long-term growth. The strength of where we start from, which is a very unique insight into patterns of consumer spending, we are continuing to find very good ways to commercialize that. And we're also finding ways to take the platform and expand it overseas. And so those trends are going to continue, basically. And so we feel very good about the growth profile. There is – as companies become – I mean, our customers become more aware of and aligned to the opportunity that they have to make use of these newer kinds of data analytics that they haven't made use of before, there are moment in time effects where they kind of get into the new methods and so, you do tend to get a bit more lumpiness when that happens. It's really just the nature of the beast. And the rotations out by, for example, the government customers, I think are very, very specific to their situations and their conditions and really don't reflect the overall commercial potential of what's here. But there is that effect even inside of what end up looking like subscription revenues because there is sort of a moment in time at which customers get into the new methods and that will sort of create a lump of revenue at a moment in time. Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. And then in terms of the moderating industry headwinds that you called out, I heard Eva's comment about reinsurance, I guess stabilizing, but could you just broadly characterize your view of the insurance end market right now? So I guess reinsurance stabilizing, but what are your thoughts on other areas of the insurance ecosystem headwinds getting better, worse, stable, et cetera? Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Sure. This is Mark. Good question. So let me start with the reinsurance side of things. So clearly, it's a very soft market from a reinsurance perspective, which puts pressure on our customers. That remains. At the same time, what we have highlighted is there's a lot of industry consolidations. When industry consolidations happen that also commonly interacts with our contracts with what is now one as opposed to two entities. That headwind has kind of almost cycled through. So that's good news with regard to cycling through. We've addressed kind of those concerns and how we want to contract with customers going forward and what we're also seeing is some volumes back into what I'll refer to as the securitization market. We see customers kind of ramping up to continue to do business as they always have. And as they look to expand and as they look to basically grow their businesses, both on the insurance side as well as the reinsurance side. They're looking at new avenues, whether it's cyber as an example. How are they going to move their books to new, what I'll refer to, is casualty-type of extreme events. So that's a good, constructive approach for the industry and we're kind of on the cutting edge with a lot of that. So that's a positive. I would say to you that I don't see a lot of dramatic change inside the insurance industry, except for the ones I've highlighted in the past. There is a tremendous amount of technology – InsureTech that is happening. People are installing new systems. They're transitioning over. They're really looking to do the big data analytics thing. They're really looking to do digital engagement because people expect kind of better online engagement, like they would with an Amazon or when they're buying product on the web. All of that has created a nice opportunity for us to get involved in those – kind of those projects to redefine how they want to see the future. So, tough time, but good opportunities for us in light of the changes happening. So... Jeff P. Meuler - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you, both. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Manav Patnaik of Barclays. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. My first question is, I guess in the past, you've given your expectations for insurance in that same 7% to 8% camp. And then financial or Argus in the mid-teens. And now, you're sort of grouping them together and giving that guidance and from the comments, it sounded like you already reiterated your confidence in Argus. And so is the missing piece here then the natural insurance slowdown until all your investable opportunities, whatever, start coming to fruition? Is that how we should think of it? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. No. Manav, it's Eva. Maybe I'll just take it up a level just – as – I know, we always try to have discussions at very detailed levels. But fundamentally, I think what we're trying to tie our confidence to in the statements that Scott made around insurance and financial combined and the growth targets we have there is, we've made comments in the past about our overall long-term growth targets organically for Verisk Analytics. And the statement that Scott made ties very closely to that. Obviously, at the current moment in time, energy's at a moment where it's not at those levels. I think we've talked about that. I think the team is doing a great job. So really, how we've dimensioned it, I would think about it that way because we're – as Wood Mackenzie works through the energy cycle and is doing a great job, putting in that overall bucket at the moment in time would not be appropriate. So that's really what we're trying to message when we're talking about those two on a combined basis. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay, got it. And then Scott, of those 20 opportunities, you mentioned a bunch of the different, I guess, bigger headlights and what – the stuff you're working on there. I mean, I think we've heard of telematics and imagery before, but is there any hierarchy or any sort of opportunity that stands out more than the others? Because some of the stuff like you mentioned like machine learning and Internet of Things seem fairly broad. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Well, the way that we're going to provide for our growth near and long-term actually is to operate on a number of fronts. And you've got some themes like Internet of Things broadly, like cyber as a theme, where the use cases, the path to commercialization is still sort of emerging. But that doesn't mean that the ideas are anything other than very good ideas and ones that we feel like we have special contributions to make. But in the sort of intermediate term, two themes that are – the ones that you've heard us talk about a lot, actually, and we really do have a lot of enthusiasm for are the interpretation of remote imagery, which we think is a very important theme for any number of reasons, including remote imagery and the interpretation of it can apply across multiple verticals and actually, multiple geographies. And the other one that I would point to is, in fact, telematics and especially vehicle telematics, where we just – we are – we can see, in our own experience, sort of the rising volumes of data and the increasing attention to those datasets and those analytics among our existing customer base. So, you've heard us talk about those two a lot. But that doesn't mean that they're tired in any sense. In fact, we think we're kind of in the early stages of both of those being important inside of our business. Manav Patnaik - Barclays Capital, Inc. All right. Thanks a lot, guys. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari of Macquarie Capital. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Good morning. Thank you. Just a question on the energy business, could you remind us what percent of your contracts are sort of multiyear? And do you see energy getting worse here or is that just primarily currency? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, so on the first question, I would say, it's roughly half that are multiyear. And I think we've talked about in the past how we pick moments in time where we're responsive to customers and also market conditions where we choose to pull those out or shorten those. And what I would say is just with regards to WoodMac, we do continue, just in the reported results, to see some lag effect from the customer management in previous periods. But as we look at the business signing today, we're really seeing good growth in renewal signings, cross-sell, we have existing products. We have new solutions added from acquisitions over the past year or so. So we like how the year is shaping up so far. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. And then just a question on capital allocation, leverage is pretty low. It doesn't seem like there's any significant scale deals outside of the current verticals that you're in. Maybe if you could just frame for us your appetite to put on a dividend here, given your highly reoccurring revenue base, and with regard to that, the $100 million buyback. Is that a run rate we should expect going forward? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So, let me start with that. Eva might want to add a little something to this. But I want to go back to kind of the premise of your question. We actually have always seen the M&A program as being sort of the complement to our program of internal investment. One of the values that we believe that we bring to our investors that is unique is that we have hundreds of people walking the halls of our customers on a daily basis. And being in such close contact with our customers, we're able to see the solutions that are making a difference for them. First and foremost, our own, of course. But, we're actually able to see other third parties and knowing where we think value lies and what our strategy is about and having this intelligence in terms of what else is going on in the market, we will always lean into the program of M&A. And in fact, if anything, we've really redoubled our efforts to enlist everybody to be a part of the M&A team. And so, we don't see it as a world, a situation where there isn't opportunity. In fact, we think that there is opportunity. So I just needed to start with that because the way that we think about capital, we certainly care deeply about deploying capital effectively. The program of M&A has been highly productive for our investors and we believe that it will continue to be. We're very comfortable returning capital and we've done so and we've done so steadily. Whatever is the right way to deploy capital is what we're going to do on behalf of our shareholders. To-date, it has not occurred to us that a dividend was necessarily a part of that mix. We ask the question routinely. We'll continue to ask the question. But so far, I think you've seen in our behavior that we're not only comfortable returning capital in the form of buybacks, but we have done so and I think you should continue to expect us to do so. So there will be a balance there. There always has been a balance there and there always will be a balance there. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And maybe just to answer your specific question about run rate, I think just tying into how Scott described our capital allocation, our first filter that we look for is buying interesting companies that meet our distinctives that add to growth, that add to customer solution. And then after that filter is put in place, the next filter is our stock repurchase program and that's going to be keyed off, as it always has been, the value of the stock at the moment in time and we are managing that not to accretion/dilution, but rather actually to the returns like our investors would as well. So when you ask about run rate, we don't actually design our program as a run rate program. It's going to be a function of that initial filter around M&A and obviously, I think, as you know, M&A isn't sort of quarter-by-quarter, you chunk it in. And so that repurchase rate will vary across the year depending upon what that filter and what that pipeline looks like. Hamzah Mazari - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. Thank you so much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You bet. Operator And your next question is from the line of Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Hi. Good morning. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Morning. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about Verisk and my experience with the company, I would describe the business, insurance business generally, as being relatively unexposed or underexposed, I guess, to insurance end market fundamentals. I wonder if you can comment, sort of qualitatively on whether or not you think (35:59) changed and accordingly would it – does it influence the type of products you're developing, the time to market, our expectations for return on the investments you've been making and so forth. So I appreciate the comment on the reacceleration of revenue growth. I just wonder if there's something that's sort of fundamentally changed in the relationship between Verisk's insurance business and the end markets it serves. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. No, we really don't think that and as you would imagine, we actually are very alert to that and would be quite sensitive if we thought there was something there. But, no, actually, I mean, if you look at industry structure, there – I mean there's like one larger merger that is sort of in the process of ratcheting through. And as we've discussed many times on these calls and in other forums, when something like that occurs, where those two companies are concerned, there may be a moment in time, adjustment. But, yes, I mean that's kind of normal course business from our perspective. And the regulatory environment really is not changing. It's not particularly dynamic. And so kind of from that perspective, the environment in which we do our business is more or less the same. When I talk to the chief executives of other insurance companies, as I do routinely, what they are really about is changing their methods and trying to find ways to grow their businesses. That's fundamentally what they're giving attention to. And we stand in that stream of activity for them. Do they have healthy amounts of self-respect and want to make sure that they're getting ultimate value from a partner like us and do they like to talk to us about the invoices that we send them, et cetera? Sure. And they always have. But I don't really think – if you go back 15 years, you could find moments when premiums went up pretty substantially year-over-year. That has not recurred for quite some time now. So our mission is the same as it's always been, which is to do a fantastic job of relating to our customers and bringing them new sources of value. I think they're as open to that as they've ever been. I think that we are more innovative than we've ever been. And that's really what's going to determine the outcome as we go forward. I will say, we definitely need to keep our feet moving. Their issues modify and change and we need to be right there as they do. So it's not a question of staying where we are. We have to be extremely energetic. But I don't think anything has changed in terms of our standing with them. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. And if I play devil's advocate and say, okay, Verisk has been investing in a lot of these new solutions, which I think you enumerated, Scott, for a while, and you just had a tough quarter with some external pressure. Why is it now that all of a sudden, at least it feels that way from the outside looking in, some of these new solutions gain traction? Are there specific contracts or customers to which you can point that create sort of a coincidental inflection point in the growth from some of these new offerings? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Well, that is why we have the view that we have of the rest of 2017 and beyond. As we know specifically what is going on in the business, specific customers, specific contracts and so, yes, I mean that's – whenever we're reporting to you, whenever we make a forward-looking statement, it's on that basis. That's how we think about our business. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. I'll give a little color, if it's helpful. One of the things that we try to always do is take a look at what's committed from the standpoint of contracts, what's implementing, when and I think what we've seen is two things. About 2/3 of our kind of need for revenue growth is committed in the form of kind of contracted price escalation, contracted new products, contracted new customers and what remains is kind of a new sale type of target that is reasonable in light of what we've done in the past and reasonable in light of what we have in our pipeline. So we continue to feel good about the full year. Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Thanks very much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Operator And your next question is from the line of Bill Warmington of Wells Fargo. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning, everyone. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Good morning. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC So, I just wanted to get delve a little bit more into Mark's good feelings about the rest of the year. So if we ended up at about, let's see look, so (41:01) 2.5% organic growth in Q1, you adjust for the true up, it will probably be about 3.3%. So, I wanted to ask about the pace of acceleration towards that 7% to 8% target and the 7% to 8% target being the level at which all businesses are firing on all cylinders. And are we thinking you could get there at the end of 2017? Or maybe we're thinking more of the end of 2018? I'm just trying to get a sense for the pace of the acceleration. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Just to reiterate, that was a 2017 comment. So just to say it again, the rate of organic growth for our combined insurance and financial services businesses we think will be on a historic trend, in that 7% to 8% range for the full year. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And as it relates to insurance, I'll reiterate to the extent that we think of the incremental growth that we need, about 2/3 of it, we believe, are committed in the form of contract with 1/3 or so of this incremental being, let's go, get it and that's new sales. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And just to wrap on, I think you're asking a question about ramp, I think you know the nature of our business where we have a large portion of subscription contracts which is a real positive for us, but that also means is a subscription starts July 1, that starts contributing then. So naturally, as you layer in subscriptions, that layers into the growth across the rest of the year. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then for my follow-up question, I wanted to ask about the international expansion opportunity. You've talked in the past about an opportunity in banking, also an opportunity in insurance. I want to know if we could get an update on that and also maybe talk a little bit about how cloud receptivity by the client base is playing into that. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So first of all, with respect to international, there are some – we're presenting differently internationally than we used to. WoodMac has always been international. But I'm – and actually, Argus has always had a strong dimension of that. But the – I just want to underline the Fintellix acquisition and the additional reach that that provides to the Argus franchise, which is a really good news. Over on the insurance side, we are presenting credentials and presenting solutions at a level and to a set of customers that we kind of haven't before, basically. I mean we were aware of them. They were aware of us, but we are now in a position to be able to make large proposals to name brand companies. We've always been able to do that in the reinsurance vertical. But now in the insurance vertical, we are increasingly positioned to be able to do that. It's really very exciting, actually. Nothing is going to occur overnight in vertical data analytic lands the way that we do things. But we are quite encouraged actually by what's going on there. William A. Warmington - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Andrew Steinerman of JPMorgan. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Scott, I was hoping if it's okay to look back to 2016. Looking back to early 2016, Verisk thought the insurance vertical, in total, would accelerate for full year 2016 and then later, contract starts seemed to slip and the insurance vertical didn't accelerate for full year 2016 and so what I want to know is the contract wins that you got from last year that you thought would ramp and then didn't ramp, are they ramping now? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. It's all a part of the overall view that we gave you. I mean, we've got thousands of customers. And it's depending upon which part of our company we're talking about. But so the effect, the overall effect in our business is the accumulation of a lot of different things that are going on. But fundamentally, the relationships with the existing customers are as strong as ever. We are pushing out internationally, which isn't yet an overwhelming effect but it's positive, it's constructive, and new solutions continue to find their way. And it's really at the intersection of all those things that our results occur. Andrew Charles Steinerman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley. Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good morning. This is Patrick in for Toni. I wanted to go back to the stream of new products. How should we think about the relative commercial impact of the new products you're currently developing or rolling out across the insurance business, as compared to the classic products you developed and rolled out over the last three years? I'm wondering if there are just fewer home runs left to hit in that market. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. No. I don't feel that way at all. In fact, I think some of the newer solutions have probably above average potential. And it may – those of you who have sort of been with us for a while, if we keep saying the same things like remote imagery analytics and Telematics that may sound like there's nothing new there. In data analytic land, particularly in vertical market data analytic land, it takes a while to get to the inflection point. And then you get to the inflection point. And so, that's effectively the dynamic that work inside of our business. So, don't misunderstand us going back to the same themes and as you try to interpret our growth in any particular time period, you may be trying to sort of create sort of a 1:1 equivalence. Solutions, when they finally find their mark, actually have an unusual inflection relative to where they began. And so, as you would imagine, day-to-day, minute-to-minute, we're working on this absolutely as hard as we can to get established as well as feeding the pipeline with additional new solutions. I don't – it's not the case that the newer solutions have lesser potential than those that maybe we developed three to five years ago. I don't know if you want to add to that, Mark. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Only thing I was going to highlight, too, is I think we have a preference. I'd assume our colleague from the phone do that. We would prefer a subscription-type model. So as opposed to kind of going at it from a transactional perspective, we'd like to create longer-term contracts with customers and the revenue rec on that flow (47:57). So that is a way we feel that they'll use us for all of their transactions as opposed to selected ones, if you were to try to price it on a transaction. So maybe a little bit of a patient philosophy, but that's the way we typically worked up the side of the (48:14) solutions into our revenue mix. Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. And in the Investor Day in December, you talked about a $2 billion TAM for Argus. I'm wondering if there are opportunities for you to go after that market in a bigger way with incremental investments in sales and new product development or perhaps more transformative M&A. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Sort of reverse order on your question. The acquisition of Fintellix for example, we really do believe it puts us on a different foot in global markets. And there are other solutions other – I would call them kind of point solutions, data analytic point solutions that relate strongly to things that we already today that we are interested in thinking about. And that would be a combination of buy and build. But otherwise, the way that the Argus business advances is basically, we present credentials to companies that aren't customers. They find out the speed with which they can begin to commercialize the insight that we bring them from a data analytic perspective. So in a sense, I agree with the tone of your question in that the more that we can do to present credentials to an ever-expanding set of customers, the more of that we can do the better. That said, I think we've got a great team and I think we're doing a good job with that. But we're always leaning into how can we take this wonderful platform and leverage it? Patrick T. Halfmann - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Appreciate the color. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Operator And your next question is from the line of Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the margin outlook. Have you adjusted the cost based on the slow start? And how much of the margin outlook is dependent on the growth this year? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Well, thanks for the question. I think as I've mentioned, as we're talking through the quarter, we were modest in the growth in the quarter. Expenses grew about 3.3%. We are within that investing in the new solutions and also making sure that we've got the capacity as revenue ramps. So, I guess the way I would think about it is, we don't manage those expenses quarter-by-quarter because we are managing for the long-term growth. Certainly, as – if you see revenue ramp, that's helpful to margins as we go through the year. But what we want to make sure that we're not doing is that we're not being reactive to unusual, short-term events and disadvantaging ourselves for the long-term. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. And then on the energy front, how much of the rebound is dependent on oil prices and CapEx versus selling the new solutions? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. It's a mix of both. But when we talk about pricing and we talk about the energy business, it's not the case that there's this one to one correspondence between what the price of the commodity does and our growth opportunity. It is true that there has been – the shape of the price curve over the course of the last couple of years is one that hasn't been seen for several decades. It's a very unusual moment. Actually, if you think about it, the WoodMac business, there were two once in a generation things that have happened in the course of the last two years. One is that, the shape of the price curve is extremely unusual. And the other is Britain exited the EU, and the effect that it's had on their currency. Those are two real big effects, both of which are relatively difficult to foresee. In spite of all that, actually, I think the strength of WoodMac is seen more than it has ever been. But back to your specific point, I think that what you need is – what we need is essentially where we're getting to, which is a stable environment, one where our resource company customers are making money and leaning into investments on the front foot, basically. And they got, understandably, very defensive beginning late in 2014 when several of them had to borrow money to pay their dividends. So, these very, very major macro effects. But as they wash out, one of the things about Verisk is we're in the business of growing faster than the underlying markets – vertical markets that we serve. And we've essentially always done that. We've been doing that, 2016, 2017 we will – I mean that's who we are, that's what we do. Joseph Foresi - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you. Operator And your next question is from the line of Arash Soleimani of KBW. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Thanks. A couple questions. So first, I just wanted to ask, within energy and specialized, how much of the decline came from WoodMac versus environmental health and safety? And then just continuing on that question, how much of that was subscription versus transactional? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. So if you were to look in the segment, you're right. Those are the two key pieces within there. Obviously, WoodMac is a larger business than our environmental health and safety business. Although I would say that in the quarter, its performance was better than that smaller business. So there's sort of a balance between the two. As I said earlier, we still have some lag effects from previous periods in WoodMac. I mean, that's the nature of subscription businesses. And so that did contribute to a bit of the decline in the quarter. Also remember, you've got – we've got a lot of numbers in front of you. Now you've got three different growth rates per line, so if you're looking at the absolute reported, the currency effect from WoodMac would be the largest impact. And I think I talked about that $7.5 million in the quarter. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Thanks. And then I have a question that's probably very, very, very long-term in nature. But just as we look at technology that's making cars safer and that ultimately will even make cars drive themselves, which will increase safety even more, that could have a very negative impact on auto premiums longer term. I'm just curious how that impacts Verisk. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. Let me take that on. I mean clearly, that's on the minds of our personal lines of writers. The insurance industry as a whole, I think has a view that that's going to make for a safer long-term environment for people on the road. It can save a million or more lives per year. And I think there's some views out there, you can kind of do your own research that, now, the personal auto premium could be something that looks at maybe half of what it is today. I think those customers are looking to ways to kind of reimagine their business and I think a lot of it has to do with moving into what I'll call small commercial lines, so micro business owners work on the cyber side of things. That very much fits our model. That's very helpful. They want to try to move into what is kind of a personal lines flow, meaning just, do it in an expert way without people involved, and they want to move that concept, which is on the personal lines side, to commercial. So those fit well into what we're trying to help them do that. The other thing I think we should just remember as a whole, a large part of the risk throughout the world is either uninsured or underinsured. And I think that's the biggest opportunity for the industry as a whole. There's a need there and I think the industry needs to find ways to ensure what is a very, very large market opportunity with better analytics and ways to assess that risk. So longer-term, bigger picture, but (56:17). Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. I would just add that one of the things that will always be the case is, almost regardless of the size of the segment, the participants will still need to understand where they stand relative to the overall marketplace and part of what we do is we really help get a handle on what's affecting that whole space and also the relativity – excuse me, the relativities between the players. That will be an enduring need. So it's not just the scale of the market. It's also the need to pick apart what's going on in the market. Arash Soleimani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. Thank you very much for the answers. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Sure. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hey, guys, morning. It's Henry Chien calling for Jeff. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Morning. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Hi, Henry. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to make sure I understand in terms of the trends in insurance and the Decision Analytics side. I understand there's a number of moving parts in terms of the revenue growth. Just from an earnings growth perspective, is that tracking sort of in line with the organic growth post – or excluding the true-up revenue. And as a follow-up to that, in terms of the ramp-up that you expect from the new products in insurance, is that also a ramp up that you expect in earnings as well? Thanks. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes. So, there are a couple questions in there. So maybe just to start with, I think your first question is when you say profitability, I presume you're speaking on an EBITDA level. And what I would say is – I mean, what you see across the company is, we're managing expense growth to both fund the existing solutions as well as new ones and I would say that's the same within insurance. So I don't think you'd see dramatically different trends if you were to sort of parse apart the profitability by vertical because we are investing across all of the verticals. I would also note that in the acquisition front, there are a number of new acquisitions. In the quarter, those were essentially across all the acquisitions breakeven. Those are things that we're clicking into our existing business and we think that those margins will ramp. So you have those two effects within the margin. And then I think your second question was with regards to new products and the profitability of those as those sort of click in. Generally, similar to the rest of our solutions, the whole idea of build it once, sell it a lot of times. The more you put on the top-line, the greater the profitability expands. Mark, I don't know if you want to add anything additional about any of the specific solutions we're working on there. Mark V. Anquillare - Verisk Analytics, Inc. So I think we were trying to address this a little bit before. I think we are seeing uptake in some of the remote imagery. I think we're seeing some uptake in our customers with telematics. I think we have good growth and opportunities internationally the way we contracted around that will be probably more subscription that it is on the transactional perspective. So as that uptake is more of a second-half story, we would also see that as hopefully helping margins because what happens here is we've already invested in or investing in a solution. So it's just the overall dynamic of the nature of our business. Yes, there is a lot of costs that are there and they'll remain because we're investing and once we start the uptake in revenues, there's not a lot of variable incremental cost sales. Henry Sou Chien - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Operator And your next question is from the line of Anj Singh of Credit Suisse. Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I think you folks spoke to some of the contract signings slipping out of 1Q for your energy customers. Is that just timing randomness perhaps, or is this indicative of the end market that continues to stabilize? Just wondering if there's anything particular we should be taking away from that anecdote. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, the comment was about the financial services segment, not the energy segment. And no, there is – it really was just timing. Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay, got you. And then another question on the 20 opportunities, Scott, asked slightly differently. Realizing these are longer-term opportunities, would it be fair to say that the internal augmentation or development focus is also primarily on remote imagery and telematics? Perhaps, if you can offer any color on which ones you've made the most progress recently aside from their good market traction. Thanks. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yes, it really is remote imagery and telematics. Those are the places where they both represent very large opportunities and places where we're seeing commercial response to what it is we're doing. So we've talked about those a lot. We continue – we will continue for years to talk about those a lot because they're just that important. But there are a lot of things on the list of 20 that are very exciting across all the segments. And some of them are domestically-based. Some of them are globally-based. They all really rely on advanced data analytic methods and in many cases, are being founded on new kinds of contributory data, unique data that will help us to do things we think others won't be able to. So it's an exciting agenda basically. You get to a list like that by being close to your customers and understanding where their needs are going. Anjaneya K. Singh - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. Operator And your next question is from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Hi. Most of my questions have been answered. But, Eva, kind of housekeeping one. Could – you were going kind of quick there when you were giving the adjusted Q2, Q3, Q4 2016 revenues. I was wondering if you could repeat that. (62:32) the $490 million, $505 million. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Sorry if I was going too quick on that. So, just to repeat, if we look to 2Q 2016 and restated it to today's currency rates, that would have been $490 million. The reported number was $498 million. For Q3 2016, it would have been $494 million. The reported number was $498 million. And for Q4 2016, it would have been $505 million, and the reported number was $506 million. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Okay. And can I just – did that also exclude the true-up – the true-up was in the Q1 of 2016, correct? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Correct. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Okay. All right. That was my... Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. And that was just the reported number total translated at the currency rate. James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Yeah. That's really helpful. Thank you very much. Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. You're welcome. Operator And your next question is from the line of Gary Bisbee of RBC. Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hi. This is Gunnar Hansen in for Gary. I'll be quick. I guess, just the timing of the Argus contract, I guess, for the deals, have those been signed already in the quarter? And I guess, are those new contracts with existing customers or were they – some of those tied to some of the contracts that were completed in Q1? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Those are existing customers. And as we do multiple things for our customers, there is a layering of that. But I think, as Scott said, it's a timing issue and we feel comfortable and confident with that work moving forward. Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, with the energy and Wood Mackenzie, obviously, there is still some lag from some of your customers and the multi-year deals rolling over. I guess, can you kind of give us some more color on whether you're seeing greater demand or usage in various regions or some of the pricing terms? Are you guys looking to lock in into more longer-term deals? Or maybe just give us some more commentary on some of the improving trends you mentioned. Thanks. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Well, a couple of different things in there. One is the customer set continues to expand, as we've shared with you. The solution set continues to expand also where we're – you've sort of known us as the people that can describe the global supply curve, which is extremely valuable and very hard to do and a very, very nice sort of starting place – a strong place to stand. What we will get increasingly good at is and more of our business will be about is the underlying technical conditions and helping our customers sort of navigate those as well. With respect to pricing trends, we're always just – the WoodMac product set as all of our product sets, we're always stuffing more value in there. And that's one of the things that is productive where pricing is concerned. So you've got that effect. So, basically, new solutions, new customers and improving environment where pricing is concerned. That's basically going to be the WoodMac story going forward. The currency effects will wash out. And I do think that we'll see where this is the kind of thinking we're doing, but it may be that as the environment is improving, we may actually want to be a little lighter on our feet and actually sort of pull in the length of the contract so that we can – as things move, we can actually enjoy it more in real time. Gunnar Hansen - RBC Capital Markets LLC Makes sense. Thanks. Operator And your next question is from the line of Andre Benjamin of Goldman Sachs. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thanks for squeezing me in here. My first question on the energy revenue, I know we've asked a number on this already but as you mentioned that there were some contracts signed the depths (66:20) of the market and there's a lag nature to them. I guess, I wanted to specifically ask, are we therefore at the end of the worst of these lag contracts and you should actually see revenue growth improve? Or is that something will be playing through for the rest of the year and therefore, growth really shouldn't pick up until closer to 2018? Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. We would expect improvement as the year progresses. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. And I guess, one housekeeping question. Just on the M&A contribution from Fintellix, if you are sharing that as we build our models? Eva F. Huston - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Yeah. Typically, for the smaller deals, we don't share that in advance. It will come in April 1. So you'll see the numbers as we report in 2Q. Andre Benjamin - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Thank you. Operator And there are no further questions. Scott G. Stephenson - Verisk Analytics, Inc. Okay. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. Appreciate all the questions and interest in the company. And we will be back – and we'll be talking with many of you between now and then but certainly look forward to giving you our second quarter report in the near future. Thank you for your time today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\'s call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Paul Herendeen. Sir, you may begin. Paul S. Herendeen Thank you, and good morning, everybody. This morning, we issued a press release that details our operating results for the first quarter of 2013. You can find that press release on our website if you don\'t already have it. Roger will make a few comments, and I\'ll provide some additional color around our financial results for the quarter, and as usual, we will end with a Q&A period. But before we get started, let me point out that this call will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company\'s actual results to differ materially from such statements. These risks and uncertainties are discussed in our 2012 Form 10-K and other filings, which are available on the SEC\'s website. Forward-looking statements made during this call are made only as of the date of this call, and the company undertakes no obligation to update such statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances. In addition, we will make reference, during the course of the call, to non-GAAP financial measures as defined by the SEC. In accordance with SEC regulations, we have provided reconciliations of these measures in our press release issued this morning to what we believe are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. With that out of the way, let me turn things over to Roger Boissonneault, our President and CEO. Roger M. Boissonneault Thanks, Paul, and thanks for the speed reading. That was excellent. Good morning, everyone. Before Paul takes you through the specifics of our financial results, let me provide you with some color on our accomplishments so far in 2013. On our guidance call 2 months back, we described 2013 as a "blocking and tackling, taking care of business" type of year. With 4 product approvals in the first 5 months of 2013, I hope you\'ll agree that we\'re off to a strong start. We certainly appreciate the contributions of our R&D team. The approvals of DELZICOL, DORYX 200 milligram and 2 new OCs we announced in April and yesterday should provide you with tangible evidence of our ability to develop and gain FDA approval of improved versions of our core products. The ability to grow our core franchise through focused product development is key to the sustainability of our business model. Next, we will turn our attention to the successful commercialization of our new products. Let\'s start with DELZICOL. DELZICOL was approved in February. Immediately after the product was approved, we started discussions with managed care providers, with a goal of maximizing formulary coverage for the new product. We were able to secure coverage on a majority of key formularies and continue to work to improve coverage. Broadly, our managed care coverage out of the gate was in line with our expectations. We also worked with wholesale and retail channels to let them know about the launch of DELZICOL and provide information to assist during the transition from ASACOL 400 to DELZICOL. With the groundwork well underway, in mid-March, we began the promotion of DELZICOL to physicians. Our gastroenterology and other field sales resources have done a great job of jump starting this important initiative. While it\'s still early days, I am pleased with the launch strategy of DELZICOL and the overall performance of ASACOL, DELZICOL franchise. The strength of ASACOL brand name and excellent managed care coverage have made ASACOL HD an additional prescribing option for certain patients during the transition to DELZICOL. Again, very early days, but I believe the transition of the franchise is going well. I\'ll let Paul talk about the revenues related to DELZICOL and ASACOL in a moment. Let me turn to DORYX 200 milligram. In early April, we received FDA approval of DORYX 200 milligram. We expect to commercially launch DORYX 200 milligram in July. That timing takes into consideration many factors and ensures that we will be fully prepared for a successful launch. In the meantime, the dermatology teams continue to do a great job of promoting DORYX 150. As we get closer to the launch of 200 milligram, we expect to share additional details with you. For now, we\'ll just say that we are very excited to have this approval in hand and look forward to adding DORYX 200 milligram to our list of core brands. Last and certainly not least are the approval of 2 new OCs. We expect to commercially launch the product announced yesterday under the MINASTRIN 24 FE tradename in early August. We notified the FDA of our intention to use MINASTRIN 24 FE tradename for this product as we do not intend to launch the OC that was approved in April at this time. We believe that yesterday\'s approval is a positive development regarding our efforts to resolve the warning letter related to our Fajardo manufacturing facility. We are still awaiting official correspondence from FDA on that point. Let me turn to an update on product development, specifically an update on the progress made in the development of new products for urology and the dermatology segments. We have completed the Phase III development work for our PDE udenafil product and hope to be in position to file an NDA in early 2014. In addition, we have completed Phase II development on our novel tetracycline, ceracyline [ph], and are hard at work planning for Phase III studies, which we hope to initiate in 2014. We continue to be focused on important strategic initiatives for 2013. As we turn our attention to the remainder of the year, our focus will be towards the successful commercial launch of the products I just discussed. I will continue to describe 2013 as a "blocking, tackling and taking care of business" year for us, and I believe our results thus far are providing that we are playing hard and expect to be successful. With that, let me turn it over to Paul for an overview of our financial results. Paul S. Herendeen Yes. Thanks, Roger. Yes, let me start with the very high level of our results for the first quarter. Total revenue for the quarter was $593 million, which was a decrease of $92 million compared to the prior year quarter. The 2 major drivers of the decrease were the expected continued decline of our global ACTONEL revenues, which were down $35 million quarter-to-quarter and a $53 million decline in net sales of our gastro business, which is our mesalamine business. That includes ASACOL, ASACOL HD and DELZICOL. The launch of DELZICOL is progressing, and the decrease in net sales reflects that we stopped selling ASACOL 400 in March, and we defer the recognition of most of the DELZICOL revenue that would have otherwise been recorded in the quarter. We expect to recognize the deferred revenue associated with DELZICOL in the second quarter, net of applicable gross-to-net factors. I\'ll talk more about the gastro franchise in a minute. Within operating expenses, you see the results of our ongoing efforts to be efficient with our investment in promotional and selling expenses. Our G&A costs in the quarter were a little light relative to what you should think of or what we think of as our run rate due to the timing of certain expenses, mainly legal. We expect our quarterly run rate for G&A to be higher over the balance of the year, and we are maintaining our prior guidance for the full year for SG&A expense. We delivered a solid $232 million of adjusted cash net income in the quarter or $0.92 per share. Those are the top-level highlights. Let me cover a few more specifics, starting with revenue for our key brands. First, the gastro franchise. Roger shared the current view of the ongoing transition from ASACOL 400 to DELZICOL. From a financial perspective, ASACOL net sales were $153 million, a decrease of 27% or $58 million compared to the $211 million we recorded in the prior year quarter. We stopped shipping ASACOL 400 milligram in the United States in early March and commenced commercial shipments of DELZICOL shortly thereafter. The company shipped approximately $50 million of DELZICOL at gross sales value into the trade in March, of which net sales of $5 million was recognized in the quarter. The gross sales of $44 million were deferred based on the terms of those initial shipments. We expect the $44 million of deferred DELZICOL revenue to be recognized in the second quarter of 2013, again net of applicable gross-to-net factors. Obviously, there was a significant contraction of pipeline inventories at ASACOL 400 during the quarter, and that will continue as remaining ASACOL 400 inventories in the trade are used to fill Rxs for ASACOL 400 that have not yet been transitioned to DELZICOL. From the standpoint of gastro net sales to be recorded by Warner Chilcott over the balance of 2013, we\'d expect to see increases in net sales of both DELZICOL and ASACOL HD that will be partial offset to the impacts of the ASACOL 400 decline. The launch and promotion of DELZICOL is a top priority for us in 2013. Moving to our OCs. Net sales of our OCs increased $9 million or 6% to $151 million in the quarter compared to $142 million last year. LO LOESTRIN, which is currently the primary promotional focus of our women\'s health care sales force efforts, generated net sales of $52 million, an increase of 86% compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in net sales was driven primarily by a 78% increase in filled Rxs. As expected, net sales of LOESTRIN 24 continued to decline due to the promotional emphasis that we place on LO LOESTRIN. Net sales declined to $93 million, which was a decrease of 14% compared to $108 million in the prior year quarter. The total LOESTRIN franchise, including both 24 and LO LO grew 7% compared with the year-ago quarter. As Roger discussed, we plan to launch our new oral contraceptive under the MINASTRIN 24 FE tradename in early August. ESTRACE Cream continues to respond to the promotional effort that we put behind the brand and produced net sales of $53 million in the quarter, up 2% compared with the prior year quarter. That was due primarily to an 8% growth in filled Rxs. ENABLEX net sales declined $2 million compared to the first quarter of 2012. As we noted in our guidance call, we expect ENABLEX sales to decline year-over-year based on the current overall landscape for the brand. However, we continue to look at ways to optimize promotional efforts behind the brand. DORYX net sales decreased $11 million or 37% compared to Q1 of \'12. After 12 months of facing generic competition, filled Rxs for DORYX 150 have remained reasonably strong. Based on the most recent weekly Rx data, branded DORYX 150 continues to retain more than 60% of the total filled prescriptions for the combination of the branded product and its generic competitor. It\'s important to note that the maintenance of those DORYX prescriptions came at a cost in gross to net for the brand. But let me be clear that despite the higher gross to net, DORYX 150 remains a profitable brand for us. We\'re looking forward to adding DORYX 200 to our portfolio and expect to begin promotion of that product in July. Finally, ACTONEL net sales continued their expected decline, with global revenues down 24% compared to the first quarter of 2012, and that was driven mainly by the loss of the exclusivity for the brand outside the United States, which began in 2010. Also, ATELVIA net sales totaled $19 million in quarter, an increase of about 19% compared to the prior year quarter. We view ATELVIA as a great product with clear differentiation and benefits for both patients and physicians. However, due to the current U.S. market dynamics for oral bisphosphonates, the prospects for growing ATELVIA are tough. We expect that the U.S. market will continue to contract in 2013. Below the revenue line, our gross profit margin as a percent of total revenue was 88.2%, which represents a decrease from 89.5% in the prior year quarter, which was largely due to mix and volume of products sold. SG&A expenses in the quarter were $179 million, down 10% compared to prior year quarter. Advertising and promotion costs were down $8 million due to less promotional spend during the first quarter. Selling and distribution costs were down $14 million or about roughly 13% primarily due to a $10 million reduction in co-promote expense as non-U.S. ACTONEL net sales continued to decline after loss of exclusivity in both western Europe and Canada. G&A expenses were $68 million, up $3 million versus $65 million the prior year quarter. I mentioned earlier, first quarter G&A expenses are probably light compared with the anticipated expenses for the remainder of the year on a quarterly basis, specifically in the G&A component of SG&A, where normal run rate for us is expected to be closer to $70 million to $75 million in the quarter. R&D expenses were $25 million in the quarter -- both the quarters ended March 31, 2013, and 2012. The amount of our spending on R&D fluctuates based on the timing and stages of the various R&D projects that we have ongoing. The 4 NDA approvals we received in the first 5 months of 2013 are certainly a good indication of the R&D team\'s ability to efficiently and effectively continue to successfully pull programs through our internal pipeline.  Adjusted cash net income per share for the quarter, which adds back the after-tax impact of amortization of intangibles, the amortization writeoff of deferred financing costs and the western European restructuring and litigation charges, was $0.92 per share, and that was using fully diluted shares of 251.2 million shares for the quarter. Turning to liquidity. We generated net cash from operations totaling $114 million in the quarter, which compare to $208 million in the prior year quarter. The fluctuations in any quarter relative to -- for our cash flow are generally driven by a combination of earnings and the timing of movements of certain of our working capital accounts, mainly accounts receivable and accruals. I described that $114 million as being on the low side. I think all of you who followed us for a while, you will see that our quarterly cash flow was up and down but is reasonably predictable over the course of a full year. During the first quarter, we made option prepayments of our debt totaling $250 million. We ended Q1 with $290 million of cash on hand. Leverage on a net debt basis was roughly 2.5x trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. We ended Q1 with approximately $3.7 billion of gross debt, which was comprised of $0.4 billion of term debt under our senior secured credit facilities and the $1.25 billion face amount of 7 3/4% senior unsecured notes. Based on the results for Q1 and our outlook for the remainder of 2013, we are reaffirming our guidance issued in February of 2013, with a slight update that incorporates the after-tax impact of the western European restructuring and litigation-related charges but does not change the guidance ranges for adjusted cash net income or adjusted cash net income per share. Please refer to the end of the press release that we issued today for the detailed guidance table. Before we move to Q&A, let me just reiterate that our focus over the remainder of the year will be on the successful commercial execution behind DELZICOL, DORYX 200 milligram and MINASTRIN 24 FE. I believe these products\' approvals not only help clarify the prospects for our key product franchise for the remainder of 2013, but should also give you a better view of these product franchises\' prospects for 2014 and beyond. With that, I want to open up the line for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Maybe you could talk about the oral contraceptive launch and how we should be thinking about a switch. What is exactly a good switch in this scenario as far as the capture rate? And how much slippage are you expecting? Just give us a sense of how we should be thinking about this relative to, obviously, what\'s going on with ASACOL and DELZICOL. Roger M. Boissonneault Marc, it\'s Roger. I don\'t think we can get into the kind of mechanics or identify switch metrics. I think you should think of this as both these efforts were to improve the compliance of our existing OCs. As you know, historically, we have perhaps a couple of projects going on and that we\'re not always in control of how they move through the FDA. Actually, the second product that got approved, we intended to be the first. And how it turned out was it took a little delay, and it caused a bit of confusion. But like we said, we intend to launch that product in August. It indeed will be the next generation of LOESTRIN 24, and we will do our best to get that off to a launch that perhaps is similar to the DELZICOL execution, which has been -- and part of the FDA\'s concern is they don\'t want to have 2 product forms in the marketplace. They don\'t want to have a chewable and a non-chewable. So when we put the chewable into the marketplace to avoid confusion, we\'re going to try to get the non-chewable out as quickly as possible. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division So should we expect the non-chewable to be out before you even launch, as far as just bleed -- you\'re going to bleed down inventory? You\'re not... Roger M. Boissonneault No, no. That would be -- we\'re going to leave that in the marketplace. We just -- we want to minimize confusion. So it will be in the marketplace, and over a period of time, we will bring in the new chewable product. Operator Our next question is from Chris Schott of JP Morgan. Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Can you just, also just elaborating on this OC dynamic, talk a little bit about how you\'re going to prioritize LO LO as compared to this -- the MINASTRIN launch? I guess, just how should we be thinking about the momentum of LO LO as, I guess, some of the maybe promotional priorities move towards the new products and away from that one? Roger M. Boissonneault Yes, that\'s a good question, Chris, and I think probably lost in the fact is our main focus is LO LO. Our main focus is the 10-microgram product and perhaps how we focus on minimizing estrogen exposure and not at the risk of decreased efficacy. So that is indeed our strategy. So LO LO is not to go to the side with this. It\'s -- in other words, how do we improve 24 because that\'s a 20-microgram product, and we look at that as potentially like -- as a different market, and the ultra-low-dose OC being the 10-microgram product. And we continue to look at lower doses of estrogen. So I mean, that\'s part of our strategy as a company. Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. So one follow-up. Just also as we think about formulary coverage for the new OC, just any comments you can make there. And should we think about this -- that this could be kind of DELZICOL-like that we can have comparable formulary coverage by the time the products launch? Or is there any differences here or difficulties here? Roger M. Boissonneault At this point, we don\'t perceive any difference. We couldn\'t talk about it until we got the product approved, but we\'ll be out there. I think you\'ll see managed care coverage similar to what we have on LOESTRIN 24 and LO LO right now. That\'s what we intend to duplicate. Operator Our next question is from Liav Abraham with Citi. Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division I\'d be interested in your thoughts on the approvability of generic mesalamine following the documents that were recently presented by Watson to the court in Shire\'s Lialda case, where it seems as though Watson hasn\'t met the guidelines for the approvability of generic Lialda. Are you still confident in your working assumption that we won\'t see generic ASACOL 400 this year? Roger M. Boissonneault I think we\'re -- you\'re asking me a question that I really don\'t -- I can\'t really opine to the answer. I don\'t have definitive information you have to really talk to OIG, but I think you just have to separate the 2 between Lialda and ASACOL. Lialda is also a time release, so it\'s not purely dependent upon the pH delivery and how that delivers. So I read the news as you read the news, and it\'s interesting. And it may be that there\'s another roll of the dice maybe that you may lose at one court level, and they may challenge it. So it\'s hard to opine. But we\'re very confident in ASACOL and DELZICOL and certainly, the 800-milligram dose form. It\'s indeed a very tricky mechanism because we\'re trying to deliver mesalamine to the colon. Operator Our next question is from Greg Gilbert of Bank of America. Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division On the new OC can you talk about what clinical work you did, if any, and whether you got Hatch-Waxman? And what\'s the status of patent applications, if you can comment on that? Roger M. Boissonneault Thanks, Greg, for that. Yes, no, yes, we did clinical work, and we expect to get Hatch-Waxman. And we expected to -- I think it\'s going to operate under the 394 patent, and there may be some other opportunities for patent coverage. Operator Our next question is from Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital. Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division So on the DELZICOL, ASACOL franchise, can you talk about your expectations for the year? Obviously, we\'ve seen a switch to DELZICOL, but we\'ve also seen a switch to ASACOL HD, and entire franchise has been a bit choppy. So could you talk about how you expect the overall franchise to grow, how you expect the switch to go? And then, comment on the price or the realized price differential between HD and DELZICOL. Roger M. Boissonneault I\'ll just make, I mean, a brief comment. And it\'s going according  -- we\'re promoting DELZICOL. We do see some movement into HD. We\'re really not -- we\'re not promoting ASACOL HD as an alternative for ASACOL 400 milligram. We do see some of that happening. But the primary focus is DELZICOL, and it\'s going quite well. And I\'ll let Paul opine to what we\'re going to see. Paul S. Herendeen Yes, I mean, I think that we are T -- we are time 0 plus 7 weeks here, Roger said several times and I even said it in my prepared remarks. So far this is going well. And we say, "Well, it\'s going well." And well actually is also in accordance with the way we had thought it would play out. And so we\'re 7 weeks out, and we have seen more than half of the ASACOL 400 Rxs at this point, either in DELZICOL or seen as an increase in ASACOL HD. It is early days, and so people have asked us a question offline one-on-one. "So well, gee, it seems to be going well. Are you changing your outlook in the way you think about the ASACOL, DELZICOL franchise?" It\'s still early days. We are feeling really good about how it\'s going so far. As it plays out over the next quarter or so, perhaps next time we get on this call, we\'ll have a lot better feel for how we think it will actually work out over the course of the year. You did hit on an interesting point on when you\'ve seen a pickup in ASACOL HD, you will recall that, in the past, we talked about an ASACOL HD Rx being worth about 115% or 15% more than an ASACOL 400 Rx. And that\'s a function of how many milligrams per day patients tend to take when they\'re on ASACOL HD relative to ASACOL 400. We don\'t know what that relationship will be. We have 7 weeks\' worth of data, and we\'ll just need to see the way it plays out. That said, I\'ll reiterate we are very happy with the way this transition has gone so far, and we expect that it will continue. And we expect that when we get on the phone with you for the next quarter, we\'ll have a much better read on how this will play out for the balance of \'13 and the implications on \'14 and beyond. Operator Our next question is from Jason Gerberry of Leerink Swann. Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Just on the DORYX 200 milligram, could you comment at all on your outlook there? I noticed Heritage got an approval, and so I\'d expect maybe some share leakage on the 150 milligram. But could you just comment on your thoughts on holding share at -- for the 150 milligram and kind of how much volume you expect to transition from 150 milligram over to 200 milligram? Roger M. Boissonneault I\'ll quote Paul Herendeen here. "It\'s still early days". We haven\'t even launched the product. But we continue to promote 150. It\'s been pretty steady. I can\'t say that we know we\'ve made a lot of inroads on 150, but it seems to be pretty steady. We will maintain that, and then we will launch the 200 milligram. And I think it really is early. Until you actually see a product in the marketplace and you begin to see the trajectory of the product that it is premature, but I\'ll let Paul opine. Paul S. Herendeen Sure, let me comment on that [ph] . There\'s a couple of things that are a little bit different about the DORYX franchise. One is we are presently promoting, as Roger just said, DORYX 150 and doing so in a way that more than covers the cost of our effort. In fact, it\'s a nice contributor back to our pretax profitability. And so with that 150 in there, the question I think, the first question, was, "Gee, there\'s another approval. Do you think that will change the trajectory?" We don\'t. We continue to promote 150. We think we\'ll continue to maintain share consistent with what we\'ve seen so far. So we don\'t see that as a big factor. But second and I think also important point for people to consider, DORYX 150 will continue to be on the market, and it\'s a product that has done well and we think, will continue to do well. We\'re very excited about the prospects though of adding in the DORYX 200 as a new option out there. And so we\'re looking forward to that, and that starts in July. I hope that answers it, Jason. Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Just what exactly is the benefit of 200 versus 150? If you can clarify on that. Roger M. Boissonneault Yes, actually, it\'s a more efficient dosage form. It\'s indicated -- it does have an indication for chlamydia where it can be used daily rather than BID. It also includes acne in the label on the initial dose, and it\'s really 100 milligrams BID, where you can actually take this tablet and break it in half. But at this point, I think we\'ll let the physicians let them know what they think. And like I say, it\'s early days. We\'re maintaining our focus on the 150 right now. Operator Our next question is from Randall Stanicky of Canaccord Genuity. Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division Just a follow-up. You\'ve had a lot of success moving oral contraceptives or switching them over very quickly in the past. How does your -- how do your thoughts or strategy change as you think about the potential Mylan entry in October, where we\'re still not sure if that could happen, versus Actavis in January? Roger M. Boissonneault I think our strategy is independent of Mylan. They do what they\'re going to do. Our strategy is consistent with improving our oral contraceptives. We\'ve been encouraged by the FDA in these to minimize confusion on the part of the patient. So what we do is we try to switch as quickly as possible and as feasible. So whatever Mylan does, they do. We have our strategy, and we\'re going to implement it as efficiently as we can. Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division Roger, I guess, the other way to ask this, is 3 months -- given the success you\'ve had to move things quickly in the past, is 3 months enough time for you guys to get the bulk of that product switched over? Roger M. Boissonneault Well, I don\'t -- I wouldn\'t even comment on the 3 months because I don\'t even know if is the 3 months real. But that\'s -- whatever it\'s going to be, this is our strategy, and we can\'t control whether it\'s 3 months, 6 months. But you got to remember the strategy is built around building a better OC and getting patients on a better OC. Operator Our next question is from Michael Tong of Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Kallai Tong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Maybe switching gears a little bit to your PDE5 inhibitor. What is the level of differentiation between udenafil and the rest of the competition right now? And how do you plan on going about competing with the Pfizers and the Lillys out there? Roger M. Boissonneault Michael, its Roger. I think if you look at udenafil, it\'s a long-acting, so it\'s more like CIALIS than say VIAGRA or the short-acting. Not to say that -- I think they\'ve done a nice job with CIALIS, and I think you\'ve got to look forward with udenafil. We have already talked about erectile dysfunction as being a primary indication, but we also see utility on a daily basis for BPH and positioning in for LUTS, which is a constellation of symptoms. So when you look at this type of drug, the short-acting products would not have -- would probably not have utility in BPH. The advantage of udenafil is it has utility outside of erectile dysfunction, and it\'s more positioned for lower urinary tract symptoms. So it\'s a longer-term strategy than, say, just a short-term strategy to get into the market for ED. Operator Our next question is from Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna Financial. Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Maybe you could talk a little bit about the promotional investments you\'re making over the course of the year. I know your SG&A guidance was unchanged for the full year, and you talked a bit about the R&D. But on the promotional side, what\'s the cost of the DELZICOL launch, particularly at 1Q? And then how does that -- does that ramp up a bit as you\'re launching a couple of other products? And is DTC part of the mix? Are there any other incremental investments you\'re making? Paul S. Herendeen Yes, sure, Andrew. It\'s Paul speaking. Yes, first, the easy one. No, there is no DTC that we\'ll be using in 2013. The second is that the promotional resources that will help us to promote our various franchises are all part of our SG&A, have been, have been baked into our SG&A starting with the guidance. And as we said today, we\'re not changing our full year 2013 guidance to reflect the approval of DELZICOL and the work associated with the transition there to reflect the upcoming launch of DORYX 200 and to reflect the upcoming launch of MINASTRIN 24 FE. The primary promotional tool there will be face-to-face detailing to physicians to talk about product attributes and pull-through. So I don\'t think you need to model in any increases or lumpiness in our selling or in our advertising and promotional expenses, were all worked in there. And before I jump off, I think it is worth pointing out that we\'re not just using our specific sales forces to help here. I mean, one of the reasons why we are configured the way we are in 2013 with a number of territories that we have is because we anticipated and hoped that we would be in a position to be launching 2 or 3 products in 2013. It\'s possible that when we get to \'14 and beyond, we could further optimize the size of our sales force, meaning it may not need to be quite as large as it is today. But right now, we have plenty of resource on hand to do -- to affect the challenges in front of us. Operator Our next question is from Irina Rivkind of Cantor Fitzgerald. Irina Rivkind - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division You guys have done a nice job with getting all these NDA approvals this year, and I was just wondering if there\'s anything loaded into the NDA submission pipeline from last year that could still potentially be approved this year. And if so, would you have any remaining promotional capacity for it, given that you\'re launching 3 new products? Roger M. Boissonneault I think, as Paul said, we do have certainly promotional capacity. And if the question is, "Are we done this year?" No. I mean, we do have -- we have the potential -- as you said, there\'s a potential for perhaps another approval this year. I know it\'s hard to believe that if you can get 4 done in 1 year, you should be happy. But we figured our R&D group has broad shoulders, and we\'re dependent on them. And there is potential to get another NDA approved this year, and we look forward to that. Paul S. Herendeen Yes, Irina, it\'s Paul. At the risk of over buttering the toast, you said it\'s nice that we\'ve got these approvals. I think it\'s terrific. I think Roger referenced the performance of our R&D group earlier, and it\'s not just the R&D, but it\'s a group of people within our company. It\'s remarkable to get 4 NDAs approved 5 months into the year. As Roger just alluded, we have other things that we are working on that can be helpful to us and can further solidify our future. I think it\'s terrific. Operator Our last question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Christopher Caponetti - Morgan Stanley, Research Division This is Chris Caponetti for Dave Risinger. First, on ASACOL HD, can you just provide us an update of ongoing patent litigation with Zydus? I believe there was some order or proposed order on the Markman hearing ruling recently. And then also, do you think the uptake -- I know it\'s early days, but the uptake we\'re seeing in HD, is that durable? Or is that share going to shift to DELZICOL over time? My second question -- or I guess my third is just to clarify an earlier question. So are you guys expecting to get the 3 years of data exclusivity on the new chewable OC? And then finally, just a quick modeling question. In 2Q, should we just be adding $44 million to our DELZICOL numbers? Or is there some additional nuance there? Roger M. Boissonneault Okay. So I\'ll try to hit -- I think Paul definitely cleans up on this one. But we do believe we had a positive Markman hearing on ASACOL. As far as the HD, we\'re kind of surprised of the movement in HD, and we\'re watching it as you are watching it. And that\'s probably due to the similarities of the trademark. But it\'s not the results of our promotional efforts. As far as the chewable, we expect to get the 3-year Waxman-Hatch coverage on that, and that should be listed. Paul S. Herendeen I\'m sorry, what was the cleanup question? Roger M. Boissonneault The cleanup question is an outlook question, forecast. Christopher Caponetti - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Yes, it\'s just... Paul S. Herendeen Yes, okay, with respect to DELZICOL, the 40 -- first of all, the $44 million that we deferred is gross sales, and so you have to degrade that by the gross-to-net amounts. Because it\'s initial load, it\'s not going to be on top of normal. What you\'re basically doing is priming the pump or establishing appropriate levels of pipeline inventory out there. You have to think of the 3 different products in the first quarter make up the mesalamine franchise for our company. ASACOL 400 pipeline contraction, significant pipeline contraction, we stopped shipping, Rxs are filled and eventually depletes the channel and that moves on. Second is to the extent that we\'re ramping up, as we are, with DELZICOL, you expect not just to record sales for the actual pull-through but also to establish that initial pipeline. There will be no more sales for ASACOL 400 recorded for the balance of the year so that\'s behind us in Q1. Now with DELZICOL, you\'re going to see a match between in-demand plus the appropriate build of the pipeline inventories out there so that the distributors and retailers can have an appropriate service level in servicing their customers. Last, you have seen a significant increase in ASACOL HD Rxs. So in addition to the pull -- the increased pull-through, you would expect to see those pipelines expand so that they can maintain the same high service level, meaning they being, in this case, the distributors and retailers, high service level than being able to fill Rxs for HD when it\'s out there. So it\'s really dynamic. So looking to say, "Gee, I\'m just going to add some number to my Q2," probably not. But I\'ll go back to where I started. We\'re -- we feel good about our full year, all products, revenue guidance for 2013. Lots of these things we\'re taking into consideration in developing that guidance. We\'re off to a great start on that mesalamine franchise, and it\'s going to be hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But I think when we get to the end of year, we\'re all going to be happy. Operator I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Paul S. Herendeen Yes, thanks. It\'s Paul. I\'ll deliver the closing remarks, I mean. Last winter, Roger and I started communicating to you that 2013 was going to be a year that we needed to deliver on a number of initiatives that would give the market comfort that our business model is sustainable and to give you better visibility into our revenue prospects over the next few years. And I\'d say, so far, we\'re delivering. The 4 NDAs in the first 5 months of the year, that\'s, as I said, remarkable, and we\'re looking for more. Now I\'ve been associated with Warner Chilcott for most of the last 17 years, and I can\'t recall a moment in time where we had this much visibility into our prospects. Beginning in the second half of 2012, investor concerns started growing around the sustainability of our ASACOL franchise and ticking clock on the LOESTRIN 24 brand. Sitting here now, we\'ve launched DELZICOL with good early results. It is a safe assumption that we\'re working on improved versions for ASACOL HD as well. On the OC front our plans for the LOESTRIN 24 franchise are coming into focus. We\'re launching MINASTRIN 24 FE in early August, and we have another approved product that we\'ll continue to work on, but may have available in the future. We\'ve been saying this for a while, but I\'ll say it again and with even more conviction. We expect to be a leader in the branded contraception space for the foreseeable future, and we expect this category to be a growth driver for us. Then, there\'s our dermatology business. In the face of generic competition for our DORYX 150 milligram product, our dermatology sales team has maintained a very respectable share of that business, and we\'ve got the approval of the DORYX 200 milligram. We\'re launching that in July, and I\'d say that\'s pretty exciting. Away from these 3 important franchises, we continue to develop new improved versions for each of our key brands, so our prospects in the intermediate term look pretty bright. Thank you for your interest in Warner Chilcott. If the remainder of 2013 is productive, as we\'ve been so far, it\'s going to be a heck of a year. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\'s conference. Thank you for your participation, and  have a wonderful day.

If you have any additional questions about our online transcripts, please contact us at:  transcripts@seekingalpha.com . Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Marc Goodman of UBS. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Maybe you could talk about the oral contraceptive launch and how we should be thinking about a switch. What is exactly a good switch in this scenario as far as the capture rate? And how much slippage are you expecting? Just give us a sense of how we should be thinking about this relative to, obviously, what\'s going on with ASACOL and DELZICOL. Roger M. Boissonneault Marc, it\'s Roger. I don\'t think we can get into the kind of mechanics or identify switch metrics. I think you should think of this as both these efforts were to improve the compliance of our existing OCs. As you know, historically, we have perhaps a couple of projects going on and that we\'re not always in control of how they move through the FDA. Actually, the second product that got approved, we intended to be the first. And how it turned out was it took a little delay, and it caused a bit of confusion. But like we said, we intend to launch that product in August. It indeed will be the next generation of LOESTRIN 24, and we will do our best to get that off to a launch that perhaps is similar to the DELZICOL execution, which has been -- and part of the FDA\'s concern is they don\'t want to have 2 product forms in the marketplace. They don\'t want to have a chewable and a non-chewable. So when we put the chewable into the marketplace to avoid confusion, we\'re going to try to get the non-chewable out as quickly as possible. Marc Goodman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division So should we expect the non-chewable to be out before you even launch, as far as just bleed -- you\'re going to bleed down inventory? You\'re not... Roger M. Boissonneault No, no. That would be -- we\'re going to leave that in the marketplace. We just -- we want to minimize confusion. So it will be in the marketplace, and over a period of time, we will bring in the new chewable product. Operator Our next question is from Chris Schott of JP Morgan. Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Can you just, also just elaborating on this OC dynamic, talk a little bit about how you\'re going to prioritize LO LO as compared to this -- the MINASTRIN launch? I guess, just how should we be thinking about the momentum of LO LO as, I guess, some of the maybe promotional priorities move towards the new products and away from that one? Roger M. Boissonneault Yes, that\'s a good question, Chris, and I think probably lost in the fact is our main focus is LO LO. Our main focus is the 10-microgram product and perhaps how we focus on minimizing estrogen exposure and not at the risk of decreased efficacy. So that is indeed our strategy. So LO LO is not to go to the side with this. It\'s -- in other words, how do we improve 24 because that\'s a 20-microgram product, and we look at that as potentially like -- as a different market, and the ultra-low-dose OC being the 10-microgram product. And we continue to look at lower doses of estrogen. So I mean, that\'s part of our strategy as a company. Christopher T. Schott - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Okay. So one follow-up. Just also as we think about formulary coverage for the new OC, just any comments you can make there. And should we think about this -- that this could be kind of DELZICOL-like that we can have comparable formulary coverage by the time the products launch? Or is there any differences here or difficulties here? Roger M. Boissonneault At this point, we don\'t perceive any difference. We couldn\'t talk about it until we got the product approved, but we\'ll be out there. I think you\'ll see managed care coverage similar to what we have on LOESTRIN 24 and LO LO right now. That\'s what we intend to duplicate. Operator Our next question is from Liav Abraham with Citi. Liav Abraham - Citigroup Inc, Research Division I\'d be interested in your thoughts on the approvability of generic mesalamine following the documents that were recently presented by Watson to the court in Shire\'s Lialda case, where it seems as though Watson hasn\'t met the guidelines for the approvability of generic Lialda. Are you still confident in your working assumption that we won\'t see generic ASACOL 400 this year? Roger M. Boissonneault I think we\'re -- you\'re asking me a question that I really don\'t -- I can\'t really opine to the answer. I don\'t have definitive information you have to really talk to OIG, but I think you just have to separate the 2 between Lialda and ASACOL. Lialda is also a time release, so it\'s not purely dependent upon the pH delivery and how that delivers. So I read the news as you read the news, and it\'s interesting. And it may be that there\'s another roll of the dice maybe that you may lose at one court level, and they may challenge it. So it\'s hard to opine. But we\'re very confident in ASACOL and DELZICOL and certainly, the 800-milligram dose form. It\'s indeed a very tricky mechanism because we\'re trying to deliver mesalamine to the colon. Operator Our next question is from Greg Gilbert of Bank of America. Gregory B. Gilbert - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division On the new OC can you talk about what clinical work you did, if any, and whether you got Hatch-Waxman? And what\'s the status of patent applications, if you can comment on that? Roger M. Boissonneault Thanks, Greg, for that. Yes, no, yes, we did clinical work, and we expect to get Hatch-Waxman. And we expected to -- I think it\'s going to operate under the 394 patent, and there may be some other opportunities for patent coverage. Operator Our next question is from Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital. Shibani Malhotra - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division So on the DELZICOL, ASACOL franchise, can you talk about your expectations for the year? Obviously, we\'ve seen a switch to DELZICOL, but we\'ve also seen a switch to ASACOL HD, and entire franchise has been a bit choppy. So could you talk about how you expect the overall franchise to grow, how you expect the switch to go? And then, comment on the price or the realized price differential between HD and DELZICOL. Roger M. Boissonneault I\'ll just make, I mean, a brief comment. And it\'s going according  -- we\'re promoting DELZICOL. We do see some movement into HD. We\'re really not -- we\'re not promoting ASACOL HD as an alternative for ASACOL 400 milligram. We do see some of that happening. But the primary focus is DELZICOL, and it\'s going quite well. And I\'ll let Paul opine to what we\'re going to see. Paul S. Herendeen Yes, I mean, I think that we are T -- we are time 0 plus 7 weeks here, Roger said several times and I even said it in my prepared remarks. So far this is going well. And we say, "Well, it\'s going well." And well actually is also in accordance with the way we had thought it would play out. And so we\'re 7 weeks out, and we have seen more than half of the ASACOL 400 Rxs at this point, either in DELZICOL or seen as an increase in ASACOL HD. It is early days, and so people have asked us a question offline one-on-one. "So well, gee, it seems to be going well. Are you changing your outlook in the way you think about the ASACOL, DELZICOL franchise?" It\'s still early days. We are feeling really good about how it\'s going so far. As it plays out over the next quarter or so, perhaps next time we get on this call, we\'ll have a lot better feel for how we think it will actually work out over the course of the year. You did hit on an interesting point on when you\'ve seen a pickup in ASACOL HD, you will recall that, in the past, we talked about an ASACOL HD Rx being worth about 115% or 15% more than an ASACOL 400 Rx. And that\'s a function of how many milligrams per day patients tend to take when they\'re on ASACOL HD relative to ASACOL 400. We don\'t know what that relationship will be. We have 7 weeks\' worth of data, and we\'ll just need to see the way it plays out. That said, I\'ll reiterate we are very happy with the way this transition has gone so far, and we expect that it will continue. And we expect that when we get on the phone with you for the next quarter, we\'ll have a much better read on how this will play out for the balance of \'13 and the implications on \'14 and beyond. Operator Our next question is from Jason Gerberry of Leerink Swann. Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Just on the DORYX 200 milligram, could you comment at all on your outlook there? I noticed Heritage got an approval, and so I\'d expect maybe some share leakage on the 150 milligram. But could you just comment on your thoughts on holding share at -- for the 150 milligram and kind of how much volume you expect to transition from 150 milligram over to 200 milligram? Roger M. Boissonneault I\'ll quote Paul Herendeen here. "It\'s still early days". We haven\'t even launched the product. But we continue to promote 150. It\'s been pretty steady. I can\'t say that we know we\'ve made a lot of inroads on 150, but it seems to be pretty steady. We will maintain that, and then we will launch the 200 milligram. And I think it really is early. Until you actually see a product in the marketplace and you begin to see the trajectory of the product that it is premature, but I\'ll let Paul opine. Paul S. Herendeen Sure, let me comment on that [ph] . There\'s a couple of things that are a little bit different about the DORYX franchise. One is we are presently promoting, as Roger just said, DORYX 150 and doing so in a way that more than covers the cost of our effort. In fact, it\'s a nice contributor back to our pretax profitability. And so with that 150 in there, the question I think, the first question, was, "Gee, there\'s another approval. Do you think that will change the trajectory?" We don\'t. We continue to promote 150. We think we\'ll continue to maintain share consistent with what we\'ve seen so far. So we don\'t see that as a big factor. But second and I think also important point for people to consider, DORYX 150 will continue to be on the market, and it\'s a product that has done well and we think, will continue to do well. We\'re very excited about the prospects though of adding in the DORYX 200 as a new option out there. And so we\'re looking forward to that, and that starts in July. I hope that answers it, Jason. Jason M. Gerberry - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Just what exactly is the benefit of 200 versus 150? If you can clarify on that. Roger M. Boissonneault Yes, actually, it\'s a more efficient dosage form. It\'s indicated -- it does have an indication for chlamydia where it can be used daily rather than BID. It also includes acne in the label on the initial dose, and it\'s really 100 milligrams BID, where you can actually take this tablet and break it in half. But at this point, I think we\'ll let the physicians let them know what they think. And like I say, it\'s early days. We\'re maintaining our focus on the 150 right now. Operator Our next question is from Randall Stanicky of Canaccord Genuity. Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division Just a follow-up. You\'ve had a lot of success moving oral contraceptives or switching them over very quickly in the past. How does your -- how do your thoughts or strategy change as you think about the potential Mylan entry in October, where we\'re still not sure if that could happen, versus Actavis in January? Roger M. Boissonneault I think our strategy is independent of Mylan. They do what they\'re going to do. Our strategy is consistent with improving our oral contraceptives. We\'ve been encouraged by the FDA in these to minimize confusion on the part of the patient. So what we do is we try to switch as quickly as possible and as feasible. So whatever Mylan does, they do. We have our strategy, and we\'re going to implement it as efficiently as we can. Randall Stanicky - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division Roger, I guess, the other way to ask this, is 3 months -- given the success you\'ve had to move things quickly in the past, is 3 months enough time for you guys to get the bulk of that product switched over? Roger M. Boissonneault Well, I don\'t -- I wouldn\'t even comment on the 3 months because I don\'t even know if is the 3 months real. But that\'s -- whatever it\'s going to be, this is our strategy, and we can\'t control whether it\'s 3 months, 6 months. But you got to remember the strategy is built around building a better OC and getting patients on a better OC. Operator Our next question is from Michael Tong of Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Kallai Tong - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division Maybe switching gears a little bit to your PDE5 inhibitor. What is the level of differentiation between udenafil and the rest of the competition right now? And how do you plan on going about competing with the Pfizers and the Lillys out there? Roger M. Boissonneault Michael, its Roger. I think if you look at udenafil, it\'s a long-acting, so it\'s more like CIALIS than say VIAGRA or the short-acting. Not to say that -- I think they\'ve done a nice job with CIALIS, and I think you\'ve got to look forward with udenafil. We have already talked about erectile dysfunction as being a primary indication, but we also see utility on a daily basis for BPH and positioning in for LUTS, which is a constellation of symptoms. So when you look at this type of drug, the short-acting products would not have -- would probably not have utility in BPH. The advantage of udenafil is it has utility outside of erectile dysfunction, and it\'s more positioned for lower urinary tract symptoms. So it\'s a longer-term strategy than, say, just a short-term strategy to get into the market for ED. Operator Our next question is from Andrew Finkelstein of Susquehanna Financial. Andrew Finkelstein - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division Maybe you could talk a little bit about the promotional investments you\'re making over the course of the year. I know your SG&A guidance was unchanged for the full year, and you talked a bit about the R&D. But on the promotional side, what\'s the cost of the DELZICOL launch, particularly at 1Q? And then how does that -- does that ramp up a bit as you\'re launching a couple of other products? And is DTC part of the mix? Are there any other incremental investments you\'re making? Paul S. Herendeen Yes, sure, Andrew. It\'s Paul speaking. Yes, first, the easy one. No, there is no DTC that we\'ll be using in 2013. The second is that the promotional resources that will help us to promote our various franchises are all part of our SG&A, have been, have been baked into our SG&A starting with the guidance. And as we said today, we\'re not changing our full year 2013 guidance to reflect the approval of DELZICOL and the work associated with the transition there to reflect the upcoming launch of DORYX 200 and to reflect the upcoming launch of MINASTRIN 24 FE. The primary promotional tool there will be face-to-face detailing to physicians to talk about product attributes and pull-through. So I don\'t think you need to model in any increases or lumpiness in our selling or in our advertising and promotional expenses, were all worked in there. And before I jump off, I think it is worth pointing out that we\'re not just using our specific sales forces to help here. I mean, one of the reasons why we are configured the way we are in 2013 with a number of territories that we have is because we anticipated and hoped that we would be in a position to be launching 2 or 3 products in 2013. It\'s possible that when we get to \'14 and beyond, we could further optimize the size of our sales force, meaning it may not need to be quite as large as it is today. But right now, we have plenty of resource on hand to do -- to affect the challenges in front of us. Operator Our next question is from Irina Rivkind of Cantor Fitzgerald. Irina Rivkind - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division You guys have done a nice job with getting all these NDA approvals this year, and I was just wondering if there\'s anything loaded into the NDA submission pipeline from last year that could still potentially be approved this year. And if so, would you have any remaining promotional capacity for it, given that you\'re launching 3 new products? Roger M. Boissonneault I think, as Paul said, we do have certainly promotional capacity. And if the question is, "Are we done this year?" No. I mean, we do have -- we have the potential -- as you said, there\'s a potential for perhaps another approval this year. I know it\'s hard to believe that if you can get 4 done in 1 year, you should be happy. But we figured our R&D group has broad shoulders, and we\'re dependent on them. And there is potential to get another NDA approved this year, and we look forward to that. Paul S. Herendeen Yes, Irina, it\'s Paul. At the risk of over buttering the toast, you said it\'s nice that we\'ve got these approvals. I think it\'s terrific. I think Roger referenced the performance of our R&D group earlier, and it\'s not just the R&D, but it\'s a group of people within our company. It\'s remarkable to get 4 NDAs approved 5 months into the year. As Roger just alluded, we have other things that we are working on that can be helpful to us and can further solidify our future. I think it\'s terrific. Operator Our last question is from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley. Christopher Caponetti - Morgan Stanley, Research Division This is Chris Caponetti for Dave Risinger. First, on ASACOL HD, can you just provide us an update of ongoing patent litigation with Zydus? I believe there was some order or proposed order on the Markman hearing ruling recently. And then also, do you think the uptake -- I know it\'s early days, but the uptake we\'re seeing in HD, is that durable? Or is that share going to shift to DELZICOL over time? My second question -- or I guess my third is just to clarify an earlier question. So are you guys expecting to get the 3 years of data exclusivity on the new chewable OC? And then finally, just a quick modeling question. In 2Q, should we just be adding $44 million to our DELZICOL numbers? Or is there some additional nuance there? Roger M. Boissonneault Okay. So I\'ll try to hit -- I think Paul definitely cleans up on this one. But we do believe we had a positive Markman hearing on ASACOL. As far as the HD, we\'re kind of surprised of the movement in HD, and we\'re watching it as you are watching it. And that\'s probably due to the similarities of the trademark. But it\'s not the results of our promotional efforts. As far as the chewable, we expect to get the 3-year Waxman-Hatch coverage on that, and that should be listed. Paul S. Herendeen I\'m sorry, what was the cleanup question? Roger M. Boissonneault The cleanup question is an outlook question, forecast. Christopher Caponetti - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Yes, it\'s just... Paul S. Herendeen Yes, okay, with respect to DELZICOL, the 40 -- first of all, the $44 million that we deferred is gross sales, and so you have to degrade that by the gross-to-net amounts. Because it\'s initial load, it\'s not going to be on top of normal. What you\'re basically doing is priming the pump or establishing appropriate levels of pipeline inventory out there. You have to think of the 3 different products in the first quarter make up the mesalamine franchise for our company. ASACOL 400 pipeline contraction, significant pipeline contraction, we stopped shipping, Rxs are filled and eventually depletes the channel and that moves on. Second is to the extent that we\'re ramping up, as we are, with DELZICOL, you expect not just to record sales for the actual pull-through but also to establish that initial pipeline. There will be no more sales for ASACOL 400 recorded for the balance of the year so that\'s behind us in Q1. Now with DELZICOL, you\'re going to see a match between in-demand plus the appropriate build of the pipeline inventories out there so that the distributors and retailers can have an appropriate service level in servicing their customers. Last, you have seen a significant increase in ASACOL HD Rxs. So in addition to the pull -- the increased pull-through, you would expect to see those pipelines expand so that they can maintain the same high service level, meaning they being, in this case, the distributors and retailers, high service level than being able to fill Rxs for HD when it\'s out there. So it\'s really dynamic. So looking to say, "Gee, I\'m just going to add some number to my Q2," probably not. But I\'ll go back to where I started. We\'re -- we feel good about our full year, all products, revenue guidance for 2013. Lots of these things we\'re taking into consideration in developing that guidance. We\'re off to a great start on that mesalamine franchise, and it\'s going to be hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But I think when we get to the end of year, we\'re all going to be happy. Operator I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for closing remarks. Paul S. Herendeen Yes, thanks. It\'s Paul. I\'ll deliver the closing remarks, I mean. Last winter, Roger and I started communicating to you that 2013 was going to be a year that we needed to deliver on a number of initiatives that would give the market comfort that our business model is sustainable and to give you better visibility into our revenue prospects over the next few years. And I\'d say, so far, we\'re delivering. The 4 NDAs in the first 5 months of the year, that\'s, as I said, remarkable, and we\'re looking for more. Now I\'ve been associated with Warner Chilcott for most of the last 17 years, and I can\'t recall a moment in time where we had this much visibility into our prospects.
