Our earnings press release dated April 5, 2017 can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web-site at www.bedbathandbeyond.com. Here are some highlights. For the fourth quarter, net earnings per diluted share were $1.84. Net sales were approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4% compared to the prior year period. Comparable sales increased approximately 0.4%, and comparable sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. For the full year, net earnings per diluted share were $4.58. Net sales were approximately $12.2 billion, an increase of approximately 0.9%. Comparable sales decreased approximately 0.6%, and comparable sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, from $0.125 per share, to be paid on July 18, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. During our call today, Sue will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, and then Steven will give an update on some of the initiatives we are working on to position ourselves for long-term success. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions. I will now turn the call over to Sue. Susan E. Lattmann Thanks Janet. I'll start with a review of our fourth quarter results. Our net sales were approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4% over last year, which is consistent with our model assumptions in December. This increase is primarily due to a 3% increase in non-comp sales including PMall, One Kings Lane and new stores and a 0.4% increase in comp sales. The increase in our comp sales reflects an increase in the average transaction amount, which was partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions in stores. We believe in an integrated and seamless customer experience, and as we have explained previously, while we cannot tell you through which channel a sale was initiated, we can provide information based on where the sale was consummated. With that said, comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while comp sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. Gross margin was approximately 38% as compared to approximately 38.6% in the prior year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, first, an increase in net direct to customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping thresholds from $49 last year to $29 this year and free shipping for the first few days of the quarter which included Cyber Monday, and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemptions and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total Company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 12 basis points while the inclusion of PMall contributed 19 basis points to the total Company gross margin. For the full year, the rate of gross margin deleverage was the same as 2015, which was consistent with our model. SG&A in the quarter was approximately 25.8% of net sales. This compares to 24% in the fourth quarter of last year which included a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items. The remainder of the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in advertising expenses and an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses. The inclusion of One Kings Lane and PMall increased total Company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 and 5 basis points respectively in the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was approximately $16.8 million compared to $24.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease in net interest expense was primarily the result of an $8 million favorable change in the value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan investments, which was fully offset in SG&A and therefore did not impact net earnings. Our income tax rate was approximately 35% compared to approximately 36% in the prior year period. The fourth quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefit of approximately $9 million this year as compared to about $7 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.84. Moving onto the balance sheet, we ended the year with approximately $578 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.2% compared to the end of the prior year period. This increase was due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the year were approximately $374 million, with some of the anticipated spend for 2016 moving into 2017. CapEx for the year included the following; enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in our data warehouse and data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including the implementation of our new POS system into some of our stores; investments in new systems and support to accelerate the expansion of our online assortment; the replatforming of One Kings Lane's systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; the expansion of our customer contact center in Layton and enhancements to its systems; and investments in new stores, including the opening of BEYOND at Liberty View in Brooklyn, store relocations and store refurbishments. During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed four stores. For the full year, we opened 29 and closed 13 stores. Our store openings during the year included new store formats such as BEYOND at Liberty View and the two new andThat! stores, plus additional Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in Canada and new markets primarily for Cost Plus World Market and Harmon Face Values. Share repurchases under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program were approximately $171 million in the fourth quarter, representing about 4.1 million shares. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, from $0.125 per share, to be paid on July 18, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. Regarding our outlook for fiscal 2017, which is a 53-week year, we are working off a set of assumptions as we do every year. Some of these assumptions are easier to model based upon our historical performance and current trends and some of these assumptions are more difficult to model due to variables such as timing and the sensitivity to the changing retail landscape. Then we have a number of things that are not included in our model but could impact our financial results this year, such as potential regulatory changes including corporate tax reform. So with that in mind, let's start with the assumptions that are easier to model given our historical performance and current trends. Taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, we are modeling a low to mid single-digit percentage increase in consolidated net sales for the full year. We are also modeling an increase in comparable sales. However, the range is from relatively flat to slightly positive, including continued strong growth in our customer-facing digital channels. We are modeling gross margin deleverage for 2017 including increases in net direct to customer shipping expense and coupon expense. We anticipate the 2017 rate of deleverage to be less than that of 2016. We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a result of payroll and payroll related expenses and technology expenses, including related depreciation as well as the impact from the current expense structures of One Kings Lane and PMall, both of which were acquired during fiscal 2016. We are modeling 2017 depreciation expense to be in the range of approximately $310 million to $320 million. We are modeling net interest expense of approximately $80 million for the full year. Capital expenditures are modelled to be relatively similar to fiscal 2016 subject to the timing and composition of projects. In December 2016, we said that we were modelling CapEx spend to be between $400 million and $425 million for fiscal 2016, and primarily due to the timing of our projects, we came in less than that at approximately $374 million. We believe for the foreseeable future that we are [indiscernible] at about these levels. In addition, more than half of the 2017 spend is planned for technology-related projects in support of our growing omnichannel capabilities. In fiscal 2017, we plan to open 30 new stores and close approximately 15 to 20 stores. We plan to open stores across all our concepts, including new formats and new markets. We expect our positive cash flow to fund our operations and capital expenditures as well as our quarterly dividends and share repurchase program. The completion of our current $2.5 billion authorization is planned for some time in fiscal 2020, subject to several factors including business and market conditions. Next let's move to the assumptions that are more difficult to model, such as various components of our tax rate. First, we anticipate that our tax rate will be higher as a result of the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. The effect of this adoption on our tax rate is expected to vary by quarter and does not affect our cash outflows for income taxes. Second, even excluding the impact of this new accounting standard, we anticipate the net after-tax benefit from other distinct tax events will be lower than in 2016. Considering these assumptions, we are modeling our 2017 tax rate to be higher than last year but still within the mid to high 30 percentage range for the full year, with the first quarter being the highest for the year, slightly in excess of 40%, primarily due to the impact of the new accounting standard and the timing of the [indiscernible] investing schedules of our stock-based compensation. Finally, there are a number of events that we have not attempted to model but could impact our financial results this year, such as potential regulatory changes including corporate tax reform, interest expense deductibility, a potential border adjustment tax and healthcare reform. At this time, we don't have enough information regarding the timing and the scope of these potential events for us to make any reasonable assumptions. Based on the items that we have modelled, including a slight benefit from the 53rd week, the anticipated deleverage due to our continued investments and the higher anticipated tax rate, we are modeling a decline in net earnings per diluted share in the percentage range of low single digits to 10% for fiscal 2017. We believe our 2017 quarterly net earnings per diluted share will have a similar pro-rata percent to the total year as they have in the previous year, with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter due in part to the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to the slight benefit from the 53rd week. We look forward to giving you updates as the year progresses and as our visibility to the year improves. Before turning the call over to Steven, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Thursday, June 22. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2017. Steven? Steven H. Temares Thank you, Sue. During fiscal 2016, we made significant investments to evolve our Company and advance our mission to be trusted by our customers as the expert for the home and heart-related life events by continuing to build and deliver a strong foundation of differentiated products and services and solutions for our customers while driving operational excellence. As Janet said, we reported fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share of $4.58, which was consistent with our model. This marks the fifth year in a row that we've been in the earnings range of between $4.5 to just over $5 since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. It is important to note that while we are experiencing operating profit declines during this investment phase, we continued to produce some of the best returns in retail which allows us to make the investments necessary to build a strong foundation for future growth. We are excited about the advances we are making. Today I'll provide an update on some of the key developments over the past several months that are strengthening our competitive position as the expert for the home and heart-related life events. And by heart-related life events we mean certain life events that evoke strong emotional connections. These include the customer experience that we address through developing the best and largest wedding registry, our baby registry, our new mover programs, our college and camp businesses, as well as our developing design consultation services. Over time, these interactions allow us to cultivate deeper relationships and increase the lifetime value of our customers. I'll start with some recent examples of how we are doing this. As our footprint in the furniture and home decor category continues to expand and as we further our marketing efforts to create a more inspirational presentation of our offerings, we want to be able to provide more meaningful services and solutions to our customers who are making decorating decisions. In early March 2017, we acquired Decorist in a non-material cash transaction. Decorist is an online interior design platform that connects users to affordable, acceptable and personalized home design services. Through the Decorist platform, consumers and businesses can directly connect with bedded top-tier designers including nationally-renowned celebrity designers to collaboratively work through the design process. To increase customer confidence in purchasing furniture pieces, Decorist has developed and offers photorealistic 3-D renderings of how these items look in their actual homes. Decorist also offers additional online services, including a Design Bar advice tool which provides free expert design advice within 24 hours, inspirational boards, an editorial blog, designer tips and latest trends to further enhance customer engagements and develop deeper customer ties. While One Kings Lane and Cost Plus World Market had already partnered with Decorist to market and sell their furniture and home decor merchandise, we plan to add the growing home furnishing assortment from Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY to the mix. Through these relationships, Decorist also serves as another vehicle to showcase our expanding footprint in the furniture and home decor category. So, we look forward to supporting Decorist in its efforts to continue building brand awareness of their online business, increasing their revenue opportunities and developing their technology to further their leadership in the online interior design space. At the same time, as the interior design arm for Bed Bath & Beyond, we plan to leverage Decorist online platform to initiate and/or enhance our design consultation offerings for some of our concepts. In another example, as we focus on providing deeper and more personalized shopping experiences, we seek to strengthen our relationships with customers who are also cooking and baking enthusiasts. In January, we made a small acquisition of certain assets of Chef Central, including the brand and e-commerce Web-site. We also added knowledgeable and talented associates to our Company with great culinary retailing expertise. As a specialty retailer, Chef Central has been a trusted brand among cooking and baking enthusiasts for more than 15 years. We plan to leverage Chef Central's strength in merchandising and marketing to increase our ability to serve these customers. This includes leveraging their know-how and providing a more experiential omni-channel shopping environment in-store, including activities such as cooking classes and demonstrations. We anticipate continuing to support the Chef Central e-commerce Web-site and opening Chef Central inspired specialty departments within Bed Bath & Beyond stores and potentially freestanding stores. Our first Chef Central inspired specialty department is scheduled to open this fall in Paramus, New Jersey. These recent activities supplement the other investments we are making to develop a more deep-seated relationship with our customers, including those in One Kings Lane which serves as a cornerstone for our growing offerings in furniture, home decor and design, and in Personalization Mall which expands our personalization services and brings the complementary portfolio of differentiated products that help celebrate life events and special occasions. Collectively, these investments are furthering our ability to do more for and with our customers and advancing our position as the expert for the home and heart-related life events. These recent transactions also advance our ongoing efforts to delight our customers through our merchandising. Those of you who have followed us for years know that we are zealous about presenting an exciting and engaging assortment of products to our customers. Our ability to do this over the years has always been a differentiator for us, and today, product differentiation is more important than ever in keeping the interest of existing customers and attracting new ones. We pursue product differentiation in several ways, including our own product development and exclusivity and limited distribution with our vendor partners. For example, our product development team partnering with industry experts has recently introduced a new line of bed linens and bedding basics at Bed Bath & Beyond under our proprietary Wamsutta brand called Wamsutta PimaCott. PimaCott is made from 100% Pima cotton and is not only softer, more durable and more vibrant than regular cotton, but is also the first of its kind that can be tracked and traced throughout the supply chain using [VNA] [ph] technology. As a trusted expert for the home, it is important to us that our customers are confident that the products they purchase from us are truly 100% Pima cotton, and they can be by looking for the Wamsutta PimaCott label. We also plan to launch a line of Wamsutta PimaCott bath towels later this spring. Another example of our product development capabilities includes the launch of the One Kings Lane collection. This line of proprietary furniture and lighting debuted several months ago and has been well-received by customers. The One Kings Lane collection continues to grow and now includes a new line of outdoor furniture. Again, we believe the home furnishing space provides us a tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated products to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles. Additionally, exclusive offerings further our efforts to differentiate our mix. For example, we have recently introduced the second edition of our ED Ellen DeGeneres Home Collection, which is available in most Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. In addition to bedding and accessories, the assortment now includes kitchen linens, dinnerware and home decor including rugs. We are also excited to be one of the limited number of retailers authorized to sell an assortment of home furnishings for Magnolia Home designed by Joanna Gaines, the co-star of the home improvement show Fixer Upper. In partnership with our vendor, the Magnolia Home assortment includes a collection of rugs, pillows and throws that reflect Joanna's simple, fresh and timeless style. This collection is available online and in select Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including some of our Texas stores which showcase the whole collection in a Magnolia Home inspired department. We also continue to broaden our merchandise offerings for Linen Holdings, our institutional business, which consist of Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. Recently, Linen Holdings entered the hotel operational supplies and equipment segment, which basically covers many of the other items you can find in a hotel room besides the linens and towels. By leveraging our vast product network, Linen Holdings can now provide our hospitality customers with a one-stop shop to everything needed to fit-out a hotel room. Just as our merchandising has always been central to our success, at the very center has been our focus on serving our customers. While retailing continues to change introducing so many new ways to engage and interact, we continue to focus on providing a great customer experience across all our channels. For example, recent enhancements to our digital channels include improvements in search and navigation to enhance the relevancy of customer search results. We have enhanced the functionality of an existing search feature to make it easier for customers to search the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY Web-sites to determine availability of products in their local stores. For our registry customers, we have recently launched an interactive checklist on these Web-sites which serves as a helpful guide throughout the online experience in providing a well-rounded giftable registry. This new tool complements the high-quality one-on-one registry service our in-store searches provide to our customers every day. An additional improvement to the customer experience is a new feature called Shop the Room, found under the Trends & Ideas tab on the Bed Bath & Beyond Web-site. This online guide contains a series of curated rooms for the living room, bedroom and bathroom that showcase an array of different design styles. The initial collections include at least five different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections are intended to engage and inspire customers as they think about their home decor options. Over the coming weeks, we are partnered to begin piloting a new service online that will connect our customers to quality professionals for home installation and other home improvement projects. As our assortment of home furnishings continues to grow, we remain committed to providing the services and solutions to excel in this category. Even with the right merchandise and the best services and solutions, we strive to communicate with our customers in increasingly meaningful ways. We have always used our marketing programs as a tool to forge these bonds but today our customer-centric marketing strategy is also supported by our enhanced analytics capabilities as we develop deeper relationships with our customers to personalize target marketing, including e-mail and direct mail campaigns. We are leveraging our improved predictive modeling tools to optimize our direct mail and print campaigns, including our newest seasonal home catalog titled Spring Refresh which was mailed a few weeks ago to a select group of customers and prospective customers. This new home catalog showcases our expertise of the home through a curated inspirational presentation of our expanded offerings, including within our home furnishings and decor categories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online at bedbathandbeyond.com. As we evolve and grow our business, the opportunity to deliver best-in-class customer service across all our channels is greater than ever and we intend to do so. In furtherance of this objective, we are opening an additional customer contact center in Florida later this year that will supplement our other 24/7 operations in Utah, New Jersey and Massachusetts. As we work to differentiate our products and provide differentiated services and solutions to our customers, we also pursue operational excellence in everything we do. This includes continued enhancements to our supply chain network. For example, we plan to open a new 525,000 square foot distribution facility in Las Vegas during fiscal 2017. This new facility will replace a smaller fulfillment center in that area which will close in late 2017 and provide additional capacity to support the growth of our digital channels. We are also expanding our vendor direct to customer or VDC offerings into the Canadian market. In addition, we are piloting third-party app-based delivery services from some of our Cost Plus World Market stores. And later this month, we plan to begin a pilot for same-day delivery from certain Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in several markets including Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C. As we look back over this past year, we have made and continue to make significant investments in our Company to advance our core objective, to be trusted by our customers as the expert for the home and heart-related life events by continuing to build on the strong foundation of differentiated products and service and solutions for customers while driving operational excellence. By focusing on our mission and remaining grounded in a culture obsessed with satisfying our customers along with maintaining strong financial discipline, we will become the customers' first choice for the home and heart-related life events and continue to achieve long-term success. I would like to thank our nearly 65,000 associates, including our new team members from Decorist and Chef Central, for their ongoing dedication and commitment to achieving our strategic objectives and improving our competitive position. I'll now turn the call back to Janet. Janet M. Barth Thank you, Steven. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of our call. As usual, we would appreciate if you would please limit yourself to one question, with one follow-up. Adrienne, we are now ready to take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes I realize it's early, but just maybe given the opportunity, how have the level [indiscernible] Shop the Home collections performed relative to expectations, and then how do you think about building brand awareness as the destination for furniture in general, and are you targeting your best customers first for this, any color about how you are approaching the marketing aspect and brand building aspect of that opportunity? Steven H. Temares I think it's early first of all to really seeing and the traffic isn't of the type that like you said I think it's nowhere and it's into build, and we really haven't done a real lot of marketing around it yet. And it's the same thing with the furniture and home decor offering. I mean first, we are working hard to get the offering in place and to get the offering right. There's a lot of growth that has to take place there. So we really haven't done significant marketing around it. You might have seen the books that we did and they went out to a limited audience. There was the book that went out in fall and the one that went out now in the spring, and it's a small segment of our population, and it's really a cross-section right now as we are trying to get the learnings from a cross-section of our customers. We have our customers segmented and this is a tool to enable us to learn about each of their patterns hopefully over time. So initially that's the way we approached it. Steven Forbes And then as a follow-up maybe expanding on recent learnings, can you touch on what you have gained so far from the Beyond+ beta test? I mean are you seeing improved traffic trends and maybe what channel is that customer migrating to and do you have insight right into whether or not you are actually gaining share of wallet with that membership program or loyalty program? Steven H. Temares Sure. Again, it's early. The results have been good basically across all the metrics that we are looking at. I think at this week or the end of this week we are planning on expanding the test group based upon those results. At the same time, there are things about it like really when we look at the lifetime value of the customer, we are very early into that lifetime analysis. So we really have to understand over time to what we are seeing, does it continue, the types of products that they migrate, our customer migrates to, how often they are shopping, the shipping expenses associated with it. So it's still early but everything so far has been favorable and we will be expanding the test later this week. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman My first question is on online growth. You've seen some really healthy growth, 20% plus, for some time now. Can you give us a sense of what's working well online, what are you learning from the expanded assortment that you have online now? And then, as it seems to be cannibalizing the store to some extent, is it causing you to rethink the store format at all, how many stores you have today and ultimately what the offering looks like in that store? Steven H. Temares Sure. We could start with the backend of the question about the store format. I mean, we have been evolving the store format and continue to evolve it. Years ago we started anticipating foot traffic declining, expense structure increasing with the wage structure. The writing is on the wall and it's only accelerated over time. So, it's the smaller stores, the combining of the different offerings, all these things were underway and we continued to do those things and we only have stores obviously to the extent they make sense and those stores are in a market that with those stores were more profitable than without those stores. And there are other benefits just besides the four-wall profitability of the store because we also look at the benefits that we get in the digital world and the fact that we are able to – we benefit from the fact that we have a presence in a market for reduced advertising expense, convenience for the customer to reserve online pickup in store, for people to start or schedule appointments and initiate registry services in stores for other people to shop online for them. So there are so many benefits that go both ways. And the idea that that's cannibalization, that's a tough one to say because whether we do it or somebody else does it, the movement is to digital. And so the fact that we are getting better at digital, that we are adding to our assortment, that we are improving our search, that we are improving our content, that we are improving the speed at the backend, if everything is improving with our site, that's great. The notion that it increases cannibalization is a tough one to really assess because, again, that customer is choosing to shop in a digital world, and if they didn't shop us, they would shop someplace else. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I guess just in the shorter term, as we think about the comp guidance for flat to slightly positive this year, any considerations as it relates to the cadence and maybe how you are trending early here in the first quarter? I think last year in the first quarter you had some headwinds related to the Memorial Day shift. I think there was an advertising shift as well. Should we assume that comps continue to improve here sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Susan E. Lattmann Seth, we have provided the full your guidance as you mentioned of a comp increase of relatively flat to slightly positive, and that considers what we have seen to date through the first quarter. Other than that, we gave a full year range. Seth Sigman Okay. I think you talked about lower earnings growth potentially in the first quarter due to some other issues but does that have anything to do with the comp difference and assumption in Q1 versus the rest of the year? Steven H. Temares I was just going to say that I think the primary reason that we pointed out is the tax implications. Susan E. Lattmann We did for Q1 and the comp guidance is for the full year, but again, it considers what we have seen to date. But as Steve mentioned, it was really Q1, the lighter EPS modelling that we did was due in part to the tax rate change that we discussed. Seth Sigman Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane I wondered if we could get any more color on your shipping strategy, how you are thinking about some of the changes that you have made to the shipping fee, how you are thinking about free ship? And then what percentage of your customer can you get to within two days of your fulfillment center and stores? Steven H. Temares We have built out a distribution network to allow us to get second day delivery. I think it's well into the 90% of the U.S. population we'd be able to accomplish that. That's the strategy as far as the distribution, the location of the distribution centers. And then as well as you know that we have shipped from stores directly, so in every market we have the capability of shipping directly from our stores. As far as the strategy in the $29, I think we will be anniversarying, we've anniversaried the $29 and I think there is a little period of time where we blip and then we go back to the $49 from last year. But this year we have pretty much looked at it and modelled it at $29 for the year, and we think that that's – right now our assessment is that it's pretty much a sweet spot, but we are always looking at the competition. And obviously when we talk about shipping, we are talking about the Bed Bath shipping but each of the concepts have their own strategy and the tactics they use in connection with shipping, but if you are talking about Bed Bath, that's how we've modelled it out for $29 and we think that for the moment that seems to be where our customers – when we look at what our customer buys, the average purchase, particularly what they're buying, there seems to be a sweet spot for the moment. Kate McShane Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on the CapEx spend, I think you mentioned half of it was going to technology. Is there any way to bucket what technology that it is going to and how it differs to what you spent in 2016? Susan E. Lattmann So for 2017, we did say that more than half would be allocated towards technology in terms of the growing omni-channel capabilities. So that would include our Web-site, our phone and mobile apps. It also includes supporting continued SKUs being added online. We also discussed our customer service center that we'll be opening in Florida and the technology around opening that facility. So some of that is the items that I would say were included from a technology perspective in CapEx for next year. Operator And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser Steve, you've made some considerable operational expenditures and investments in the business over the last few years, yet you are still looking for sales to be flat or your comp sales to be flattish or slightly positive this year bringing income down by a meaningful amount. Do you think you are getting a suitable return on these investments, and if you are not, at what point do you slow the pace of investments and potentially look to contain costs? Steven H. Temares First of all, we are not going to cut ourselves to greatness, so that's again we can't say that strong enough. The investments we've been making have made us significantly better. Are we where we want to be? No. But where would we have been if we didn't make these investments is the question that we have to ask ourselves. The retail is littered with people who didn't invest enough or invested later and made the wrong decision. So that's not where we intend to be. So we do measure each of the things that we invest in, we have expectations for them, and we think that we are a much better company today than we were 18 months ago, that we were three years ago. But unfortunately, we could produce better earnings in a short term by cutting expenditures but we wouldn't be a better company and we would be setting ourselves up for failure, and what we want to do is set ourselves up for greatness and that's why these investments need to be made. Michael Lasser And how are you measuring that greatness? Does that greatness come with your operating margin stabilizing at some point or are you just looking to maximize and grow gross operating profit dollars? Steven H. Temares Again, it will be measured by our customers trusting us to be the expert for what we do, for the home related product and for these heart-related life events that we handle. So being the largest player of what we think is the best choice when it comes to bridal registry, when we look at our baby registry, when we look at our growing decorating business, when we look at our large back to college business, our large new mover business, our camp business, all these things and being the best at them and then being able to take these customers over time into analytics, know who our customer is, speak to them on a personalized basis and to be able to be more important to them and be their first choice, and that's something that's going to be [indiscernible] over time. I mean we cannot be and we won't be just a transactional merchandise and be meaningful, so we have to be trusted by our customers as an expert in this way and that's what we are focused on, and the things that we are doing in terms of the differentiated product, all these services and solutions that we offer our customer as we try to always keep an eye towards operational excellence, are the ways that we intend to deliver this for our customer and to accomplish our mission. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler My first question Steve relates to the category expansion that you executed primarily online under the core Bed Bath & Beyond heading. Now that you are a year plus into that effort, how are you thinking about its success, and quantitatively is this one of the factors that's contributing to the outsized 20% plus e-commerce growth that you're seeing? Steven H. Temares Matt, the addition to the assortment is contributing to that. And keep in mind that much of that product is vendor direct. So this isn't product that we take into our system, that we don't handle, that we don't have the cost associated, we don't have the markdown risks. But yes, this is advantageous to us from a sales perspective. Ultimately, this has to be quoted in a way that it's meaningful to the customer, that we have the right content, we have the right features and facets, that it makes good sense for the customer that they think of us for these categories, we can market toward these categories, and we are ways away from being there, but just the additional assortment in and of itself we are benefiting from. Matt Fassler Thank you. And then my second and follow-up question is most likely for Sue. So you have a couple of acquisitions that you executed over the past year. I guess PMall is quite seasonal as we understand it. So can you talk about what the seasonal fluctuations in that business will do to revenue and earnings in 2017 until you cycle the deal? Susan E. Lattmann As you've noted, PMall is more seasonal from a holiday perspective. Each of the holidays throughout the year, it is a nice business to have. So with Christmas being a bit stronger and then the rest of the year there are holidays where PMall does do some volume. So that's all I could really say in terms of a seasonal perspective. Steven H. Temares Actually I guess we also gave the information on how it affected the fourth quarter, the impact it had on SG&A and the impact it had on our gross margin, and if that's a relatively strong time of the year, you could extrapolate from that as well. Eugene A. Castagna Yes, and we acquired Personalization Mall at the end of November. So the December numbers were in our last year fourth quarter. So we will anniversary those numbers in next year's fourth quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adrienne Yih My question is on the DTC and the direct piece of the business. Where is it as of the end of last year? And as you look out maybe three to four years from now, where do you think the penetration ultimately resides, the balance between DTC, e-comm and brick-and-mortar? Steven H. Temares You are talking about direct from vendors? Adrienne Yih Online. Sorry, online, online sales. Steven H. Temares I don't think we break down those numbers. That's first of all. But most of what we are adding online has been and will be VDC. So from that perspective, you can anticipate that the penetration from that part of the business will be growing. I'm not trying to be evasive, so if you want to ask that question again, I might have missed what you were trying to get at. We don't give the exact numbers. Adrienne Yih I guess let me ask it a different way. So this earnings cycle I would say this is the first time that we have heard the number sort of 40% to 50% of people's ultimate sales call it in the next three to five years coming from the online channel and 50% of it coming from brick-and-mortar, and it was the first time that I have heard that number kind of well, well north of 30%. And so it kind of begs the question, in three to five years if you're planning now and you're thinking about that, how you look at your real estate footprint and how you plan for that ultimate penetration, if that's even something that you philosophically think is going to happen? Is that a better way of asking it? Steven H. Temares I don't want to be judgmental. But I understood that better. No, but I think it's a good question. And just so for clarity, we didn't say 40% or 50% you're saying. That's an industry number you are hearing. Adrienne Yih Correct, and it's a first. Steven H. Temares And we do believe that – and we do see the movement to the digital world and I think it has been more aggressive than most people had anticipated, and that's I think accurate, not the 40% or 50%, I don't think we could predict what it will be. But we have been gearing our real estate in anticipation of there being less foot traffic and more expensive to run. And so when we look at doing a deal or redoing a deal, is that we look at over the term of the lease, and sometimes that might only have to be five years, seven years or 10 years to make sense, and we look at estimating or anticipating reduction in foot traffic of a number depending upon the market could be 5% to 10%, we look at increases in the wage rate by market, we know what's on the books and what's being discussed, so whether it's going to be ramping up to $10, $11, $12 or $15 and what numbers are going to be like to that of other people in our building that have to go up as well, and we model it out. And right now we are only looking to do the stores if over that time of that lease we see four-wall profitability and that it makes sense to have that store in the market and we'd be more profitable for having that store than not having that store, meaning if the business went to our other stores, where would we be. So we are downsizing stores and in some cases we are increasing the size and consolidating stores. But every store we do has to make sense from that economic perspective, and we started doing that years ago. So we are in a very good position. I wish that there was – I think that we would be perceived differently perhaps if we went to market and say, we are closing 100 stores or 200 stores, but it doesn't make sense. If it does make sense at some point, we will. These stores are profitable and they are more profitable, these markets are more profitable for having the stores than consolidating. That's the situation today and we make those decisions as we go forward. But I think you are right on both accounts, is that the digital world is ramping up and ramping up quickly and that the bricks-and-mortar world will suffer for it and there will be ramifications, and one of those ramifications will be reduced occupancy cost. And what happens if the occupancy cost gets reduced? Stores that don't make sense today, make sense down the road. And as somebody asked earlier, I don't know if it was Steve or somebody else, but the format is changing also over time as we are looking to add more experiential aspects to the store, give customers more reasons for being there, we are trying to with our Beyond store we are handling all the store orders, these online orders in the stores. So these additional services that we are trying to offer through the stores, the appointment scheduling that we have in the stores, like we said the reserving online, picking up in stores, so all this is a purpose of having them as well. But we are fortune because we don't have a prototype, we don't have a 30,000 or 40,000 square foot store, they don't have to be the same in every market. So we have 8,000 to 9,000 square foot stores and 120,000 square foot. So we size them by market and we make economic sense by market and that's how we try to run the business intelligently and optimize our bottom line. Adrienne Yih That's very helpful. Thank you very much for that detail. Operator Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Oliver Wintermantel In today's multichannel world and where pricing becomes more competitive and sales shift online, so how do you think about your historic like more on the coupon side, how do you think that works in a more promotional and more online world with the coupon? Steven H. Temares The coupons are available to our customers online. At the same time, differentiated product is critical for us. We don't want to be, we've never wanted to be all about price and we have always been driven by merchandising. It's a critical differentiator for us and it needs to be going forward and more so than ever, so differentiated product is important. But the coupon is important. It's the value that we give to our customers. So being at the right price is something that we are focused on, that we crawl the Web, we look at our competitors and we have a pricing group that we are doing dynamic pricing today. So, all these things are in place to make sure that we are at the right price. But differentiated predict and then also to the degree that most items with a plug and a lot of our product is maintained by manufacturers, the pricing. So that's generally at the same price in the marketplace. So it's a significant focus for us, and over time as we have always said, we want to get to being more specific with the customer, understanding what drives their shopping pattern and what's the value to them and make sure we are speaking to them and that the value that we offer to them makes sense other than a general coupon. But we are not getting rid of the coupon, we understand how important it is and the value of it is. But we do need to migrate over time as we get more personalized with our shopper to understand what categories they shop, what they bought, what they are looking for, where they are and their buying patterns, and make sure that we are dealing with them accordingly. Oliver Wintermantel Got it. Thank you. And just a follow up on online sales, can you give us maybe, now that you have reduced your free shipping level to $29, how much of your product is shipping for free today with $29 versus $49? Steven H. Temares You're talking about just for the Bed Bath situation? So, I don't think we share that information, okay. We do know and we look at the shipping revenue and as we test things where we need to be to make sense of moving that threshold. But we do, like I said early on, it does appear to be a sweet spot for us when you look at what the average purchase is and what people are doing online. And when we have tested otherwise, right now that's absent competitive forces, that's where we anticipate being for now based upon that due diligence that we have done. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel So the first question I wanted to ask, I guess somewhat of a modelling question, maybe longer-term, so gross margins now have been under pressure for a while, down I think 20 plus quarters or so, and if I heard you correctly, in the guidance you talked about maybe a somewhat better trajectory in next year but it is still down. So as we think longer term, we recognize you don't give longer-term guidance, but just conceptually, is there a point at which given all that's going on we should see margins flatten out or even start to turn positive again, and for that to happen, what factors would have to come into play? Susan E. Lattmann The gross margin deleverage that we modelled for 2017, that rate we did model to be less than that of 2016. In terms of future modelling beyond that, we didn't share that, but in general there's many factors that would impact gross margin. For example, it's something Steve just discussed here, it's the free shipping thresholds. It's also I guess what I would say is margin in terms of mix of goods and products that are sold. It's also I would say including freight cost and whatnot. It would also depend on what folks are buying and that mix of product that they chose. So given all that and those many factors, it's not possible to say this is exactly when we would see no deleverage in the future. Those are the items that we watch and we look at, and obviously that's what we are striving towards. Brian Nagel Great, that's helpful. Then a follow-up question, maybe hopefully [indiscernible], with regards to online sales, so as evidenced by the pretty substantial growth you've had online, you guys are succeeding online, but I guess the question I have is, and I know there is an easy answer to this, who are you competing with online? I mean is it just Amazon or are there other companies playing in your space that you are competing with? And as you look at that competitive landscape right now, maybe Bed Bath & Beyond has been late to the online game, so if there are companies who are performing better, perhaps your markets are better [indiscernible], isn't it just a [indiscernible] mission amongst consumers because they were there earlier or is there some factor you think that play [indiscernible] what are the reasons the other companies are performing better online? Steven H. Temares I could think that online the truth is that we compete against many more people, that there are people that look for credible retailers, but a lot of people are searching for items or they are looking for inspiration in the furniture and decor area, and whomever shows up could be redeemed credible. And so there is a lot more competition online than there was in the four walls. So I think that's the reality. And when you say that there are things that you could do to increase your market share, and we do some of that obviously that are rational for us, but there are things that you could do that a little less rational, you could spend a lot more on your advertising to buy sales. I mean we have competitors that do that and that's part of the way that they choose to do business. So ultimately, we believe that having the right assortment, having best in class Web-site in terms of search, content, assortment to services that are attached to it, that combined with the omni-channel experience is a winning formula. But that short-term decision whether you are looking every day, your ad to sales ratio on your advertising for your online is something that you could play with on a daily basis, and you can for short-term periods, you can buy sales but at the expense of the bottom line. And then you have to ask yourself, what's the stickiness of that customer, the lifetime value of the customer, you make a lot of assumptions and you test into it and you look back on to see if you were right or wrong. But the idea about the whole thing about market share is a tough one because when we look at us for example coming out of the fourth quarter, I guess there was a number of our competitors who are all great competitors, the William Sonomas, the Targets, the Macy's, the Kohl's, the Restorations, all these people had not great quarters. And so, are we gaining market share, they are losing market share or the people shop a little bit less in our category and so maybe the whole market share, the whole market was a little bit lower. We don't have finite numbers to know those answers, but clearly our digital space is growing at a rapid pace and we believe we are gaining market share. We think that we are experiencing in our stores is similar or perhaps slightly better than what we see happening in the general retail marketplace. So if those are correct conclusions, we would say that perhaps we are picking up market share, but we are not satisfied and it's very negligible one way or the other to really understand if that's the case. Does that answer the question, Brian? Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst This is [indiscernible] on for Dan. In light of all the retail store closures that are coming this year, several of these retailers compete in categories that overlap categories that you compete in. So given this, how do you assess the promotional environment that you see over the year and are there any particular quarters where you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure from heightened promotional activity? Steven H. Temares I don't think that we will know that. In fact I think that we didn't see necessarily or know exactly when Linens-N-Things are in 3-D or [Strauss] [ph] or [indiscernible] or Home Express or Pacific Linens or JCPenney Home Stores, [indiscernible] people were closing stores. We didn't know that Macy's was going to close those stores or that Penney was closing those stores or what's going to happen with Sears and Kmart. So we really can't tell you or predict a particular point in time that the competitive landscape shifts. But when it shifts, we anticipate that in the short-term there is some pain and in the long-term there is benefit. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman First question just on guidance, just two quick parts, the comp guidance, little flatfish to slightly positive for next year, can you just [indiscernible] what's the confidence? I know it's a slight improvement. Looks like home furnishing retail sales are a little weaker than they were let's say 12 months ago. And then Sue, can you tell us about what's the embedded EBIT margin in the guidance or a range? Susan E. Lattmann Okay, so starting with the comp guidance, we are coming off of a Q4 which was a positive 0.4 comp. I think Steve discussed some of the initiatives, whether it's furniture initiatives, personalization initiatives becoming more inspirational. Those are things we are working on throughout the year. And coming off that positive 0.4 comp, that's our model, that's where we see for now for modeling purposes and we will update it as the year progresses. Your second question I believe was on EBIT margin? Simeon Gutman Correct, yes. If you could just share what's the implied range within the EPS guidance? Steven H. Temares I don't think we provided that. We did say that the tax rate would be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016. Susan E. Lattmann We did. Steven H. Temares Interest should be relatively flat year-over-year, at least we believe it will be. So I guess the EBIT range would be slightly better than the EPS range on a per share basis, but we didn't give details about that. Simeon Gutman Okay. And my follow-up, if you look at back at 2016, could you have accelerated some of the investments, therefore that leaves some less to do in 2017, and then thinking about 2017, realize this may be a never evolving answer, but you've probably been asked multiple times, does this year represent the peak investment period, et cetera? Again, it's evolving, but any sense on that, can you answer that with clarity at this point? Susan E. Lattmann We provided our model which is around $400 million to $425 million. We came in at around $374 million for 2016. And so if you go back and you look historically, that's a peak for us at $374 million and we see that plateauing in that range of the model and where we ended up certainly for 2017. A CapEx model is fluid. Things happen throughout the year. Sometimes we are accelerating certain projects that we didn't originally plan and sometimes due to sequential basis we are pushing projects out. And then sometimes there are projects that we didn't even initially planned that we end up partway through the year make sense, whether it's for strategic reasons or financial reasons. So, we make those decisions as we go and that's our best model estimate at this time. Operator Our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas One of the things the Company has done very well over the years is to take products from teams that it has acquired like Harmon and buybuy BABY and integrated into the core Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Could you maybe talk about what inning you are in with Harmon and buybuy BABY products and some of the other ones, and what role, if any, you see for some of the online brands to have a presence in the Bed Bath & Beyond stores? Steven H. Temares I think that you could look at the Web-site to see the numbers of Harmon, where the health and beauty care, the four departments, I think it's a couple of hundred I think is the number there. I'm not giving any trade secrets. So I think there is an opportunity as we go forward for that. I think the buybuy BABY departments in the store are very few relative to that even. And so all those are opportunities to do more of this as we rollover real estate opportunities, because when we opened up those stores they weren't sized for those additional departments and things that we have in the store are very productive and obviously Harmon is commodity goods and Baby margins are in Bed Bath margin. So that's things that will evolve over time and the cost of the real estate and all those things will play into what the stores look like going forward. As far as the other online brands, I mean when we look at for example the PMall and the opportunity for them to create personalized product, we talked about them being seasonal and the opportunity for them to use all their processes and to provide product to Bed Bath & Beyond for example, that's a significant opportunity for us. So that's something that we are all working on so that we do see and we were growing personalized products in our stores. Again, that's another differentiator for us, so we think that's important. When you talk about somebody like a Decorist, we've looked at the ability to provide additional services, decorating services within stores. One Kings Lane had the studio in San Francisco, a studio in New York, and that's part of their – and they just opened up something that's a hybrid situation in Connecticut which we think was very interesting. So the ability to provide that decorating service in some of the Bed Bath & Beyond stores is an opportunity. When you look at the fact that we are growing furniture and home decor online, the ability to take some of that furniture, whether it would be One Kings Lane or other furniture offerings can show it to some degree in a way in our stores so customers understand that we are in the furniture business, so that's a growing opportunity for us as well. But in each of these areas is that we do have to figure out the right points of integration so the customer understands that we have the product that they are looking for, for the entire home and that we can be trusted as the expert for the home. So these are all things that are being done, some are further along than others and the ones that you pointed to, Harmon is further along, and Baby, we have certain departments in certain parts of the country that take advantage of the Christmas Tree Shops seasonal merchandise because they do such a wonderful job at seasonal. So you could find that in Bed Bath & Beyond stores. So all of this is something that very much continues to be a work in progress, but over time I think you will see more of it and we'll leverage it to a greater degree. Bradley Thomas Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Laura Champine When you talk about adding more furniture into your stores, what do you move out to make room for that, or is this new assortment just going in into expanded and remodelled stores? Steven H. Temares Obviously again you are talking about Bed Bath, because in furniture already you could find furniture at Cost Plus, you could find furniture at the Baby, obviously it's a significant and important part of the Baby assortment. That Christmas Tree sells furniture in Bed Bath, sells certain furniture. But again, there is different thought process and different things that we've been testing. But if you even take a look, I don't know if you have had an opportunity to see the studio experience at One Kings Lane, in a small amount of space you could really explain to the customer that you're in this business. So you might not necessarily sell much out of the store or carry much in the store, but you can really show the customer that we are in these businesses, we stand for these businesses, and explain that they can find it online, because even when you go into a Restoration, their offering is limited relative to you find somebody walking around with a tablet and they show you the breadth of the assortment. So really the key is, we don't expect, and we are not saying that we're going to be a furniture store, but how do we get across to the customer that we are in the furniture business and the stores don't become a disadvantage where people say or think you're not in the furniture business because we don't show it at all and the store explains to the customer that we are in the business. Laura Champine Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. David This is David on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question. Steven, I wanted to follow up with the answer you were just giving. So in terms of making customers aware of all the product lines and businesses that Bed Bath & Beyond stands for, what do you see going forward as you having to do to achieve that goal? Is it spending more in advertising, is it leveraging the customer less and doing more targeted marketing? How do you think about it and what does it mean for some of the operating expenses and capital expenditures going forward? Steven H. Temares For the first place obviously is that you could address it in our stores, that if the people, if our customers coming to the stores understood that we had an expanded assortment, that would be wonderful. So there is a lot of ways to do that that are not big capital expenditures. And then what we do already, and there is a shift in what we do, so there is a shift in where we spend our dollars and how we spend the dollars. So how do you – what are in your e-mail campaigns, what are in your CRM programs, what are you doing with your catalogs, what are you showing, how much are you showing and how you are describing to the customers. So, a great deal of it could be achieved through a shift. And then obviously it's spending more to the degree that it drives the returns we're looking for, that would be wonderful as well. So there is a lot of things that can be done. So really we haven't even addressed the customers that walk into our stores and really have done a sufficient job of letting that customer know the categories we are growing, and again, we haven't been in a rush to do that because we don't believe in many categories we are at the point that we are rushing to get the customer there because we are presenting the merchandise in a way with content and features and facets and shopability in a way that makes it best in class. So as we go down the road of shoring rooms and being inspirational and showing having the photography right and having the content right and having the chat up to speed so that we can answer the questions, and having our vendors up to speed so they could deliver appropriately and that we could deliver to people's homes with White Glove delivery and we could deliver out of our stores with the third-party partners who could pick it up and deliver it for the customers, and so all these things are more in place. We are not in a rush to show the customer we do something not great. So when we do things, we get to the point where we think that we're doing it well enough or great. The last part and the easy part will be marketing to the customer. David Okay. And then to follow, the logical follow-up to that is, when do you think most of those things will be in place? Steven H. Temares It's a gamut, because for example like even the delivery, the delivery network, to get delivery right we signed at this very local to take the last mile on delivery, and that if somebody is delivering the sofa versus delivering a mirror, that there is going to be in a lot of cases different delivery service. So again, everything that we are doing has a different timeline and it's not as if we are going to wait for everything to be perfect before we start taking particular categories and shouting that we are in this business. But literally, if you go online today and you take a look at some of the categories, you look literally at how we show it or how easily it's shopped or shopable, there are things that we have a lot to be desired. You shouldn't be when you are looking at it for upholstery or you are looking for sizes or you are looking for certain looks or feels, again, it should be easy for the customer and we need to really to make sure that we are attributing product correctly, that we are showing it in a way that we are really resonating with the customer in being able to do certain things in an inspirational way, so that it's close to best-in-class at least as we try to get and will get to best-in-class. So, each of these things has a different timeline. David Okay. Thank you. Operator I would now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. Janet M. Barth Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us again on our next quarterly earnings call on June 22nd. Have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes I realize it's early, but just maybe given the opportunity, how have the level [indiscernible] Shop the Home collections performed relative to expectations, and then how do you think about building brand awareness as the destination for furniture in general, and are you targeting your best customers first for this, any color about how you are approaching the marketing aspect and brand building aspect of that opportunity? Steven H. Temares I think it's early first of all to really seeing and the traffic isn't of the type that like you said I think it's nowhere and it's into build, and we really haven't done a real lot of marketing around it yet. And it's the same thing with the furniture and home decor offering. I mean first, we are working hard to get the offering in place and to get the offering right. There's a lot of growth that has to take place there. So we really haven't done significant marketing around it. You might have seen the books that we did and they went out to a limited audience. There was the book that went out in fall and the one that went out now in the spring, and it's a small segment of our population, and it's really a cross-section right now as we are trying to get the learnings from a cross-section of our customers. We have our customers segmented and this is a tool to enable us to learn about each of their patterns hopefully over time. So initially that's the way we approached it. Steven Forbes And then as a follow-up maybe expanding on recent learnings, can you touch on what you have gained so far from the Beyond+ beta test? I mean are you seeing improved traffic trends and maybe what channel is that customer migrating to and do you have insight right into whether or not you are actually gaining share of wallet with that membership program or loyalty program? Steven H. Temares Sure. Again, it's early. The results have been good basically across all the metrics that we are looking at. I think at this week or the end of this week we are planning on expanding the test group based upon those results. At the same time, there are things about it like really when we look at the lifetime value of the customer, we are very early into that lifetime analysis. So we really have to understand over time to what we are seeing, does it continue, the types of products that they migrate, our customer migrates to, how often they are shopping, the shipping expenses associated with it. So it's still early but everything so far has been favorable and we will be expanding the test later this week. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman My first question is on online growth. You've seen some really healthy growth, 20% plus, for some time now. Can you give us a sense of what's working well online, what are you learning from the expanded assortment that you have online now? And then, as it seems to be cannibalizing the store to some extent, is it causing you to rethink the store format at all, how many stores you have today and ultimately what the offering looks like in that store? Steven H. Temares Sure. We could start with the backend of the question about the store format. I mean, we have been evolving the store format and continue to evolve it. Years ago we started anticipating foot traffic declining, expense structure increasing with the wage structure. The writing is on the wall and it's only accelerated over time. So, it's the smaller stores, the combining of the different offerings, all these things were underway and we continued to do those things and we only have stores obviously to the extent they make sense and those stores are in a market that with those stores were more profitable than without those stores. And there are other benefits just besides the four-wall profitability of the store because we also look at the benefits that we get in the digital world and the fact that we are able to – we benefit from the fact that we have a presence in a market for reduced advertising expense, convenience for the customer to reserve online pickup in store, for people to start or schedule appointments and initiate registry services in stores for other people to shop online for them. So there are so many benefits that go both ways. And the idea that that's cannibalization, that's a tough one to say because whether we do it or somebody else does it, the movement is to digital. And so the fact that we are getting better at digital, that we are adding to our assortment, that we are improving our search, that we are improving our content, that we are improving the speed at the backend, if everything is improving with our site, that's great. The notion that it increases cannibalization is a tough one to really assess because, again, that customer is choosing to shop in a digital world, and if they didn't shop us, they would shop someplace else. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I guess just in the shorter term, as we think about the comp guidance for flat to slightly positive this year, any considerations as it relates to the cadence and maybe how you are trending early here in the first quarter? I think last year in the first quarter you had some headwinds related to the Memorial Day shift. I think there was an advertising shift as well. Should we assume that comps continue to improve here sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Susan E. Lattmann Seth, we have provided the full your guidance as you mentioned of a comp increase of relatively flat to slightly positive, and that considers what we have seen to date through the first quarter. Other than that, we gave a full year range. Seth Sigman Okay. I think you talked about lower earnings growth potentially in the first quarter due to some other issues but does that have anything to do with the comp difference and assumption in Q1 versus the rest of the year? Steven H. Temares I was just going to say that I think the primary reason that we pointed out is the tax implications. Susan E. Lattmann We did for Q1 and the comp guidance is for the full year, but again, it considers what we have seen to date. But as Steve mentioned, it was really Q1, the lighter EPS modelling that we did was due in part to the tax rate change that we discussed. Seth Sigman Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane I wondered if we could get any more color on your shipping strategy, how you are thinking about some of the changes that you have made to the shipping fee, how you are thinking about free ship? And then what percentage of your customer can you get to within two days of your fulfillment center and stores? Steven H. Temares We have built out a distribution network to allow us to get second day delivery. I think it's well into the 90% of the U.S. population we'd be able to accomplish that. That's the strategy as far as the distribution, the location of the distribution centers. And then as well as you know that we have shipped from stores directly, so in every market we have the capability of shipping directly from our stores. As far as the strategy in the $29, I think we will be anniversarying, we've anniversaried the $29 and I think there is a little period of time where we blip and then we go back to the $49 from last year. But this year we have pretty much looked at it and modelled it at $29 for the year, and we think that that's – right now our assessment is that it's pretty much a sweet spot, but we are always looking at the competition. And obviously when we talk about shipping, we are talking about the Bed Bath shipping but each of the concepts have their own strategy and the tactics they use in connection with shipping, but if you are talking about Bed Bath, that's how we've modelled it out for $29 and we think that for the moment that seems to be where our customers – when we look at what our customer buys, the average purchase, particularly what they're buying, there seems to be a sweet spot for the moment. Kate McShane Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on the CapEx spend, I think you mentioned half of it was going to technology. Is there any way to bucket what technology that it is going to and how it differs to what you spent in 2016? Susan E. Lattmann So for 2017, we did say that more than half would be allocated towards technology in terms of the growing omni-channel capabilities. So that would include our Web-site, our phone and mobile apps. It also includes supporting continued SKUs being added online. We also discussed our customer service center that we'll be opening in Florida and the technology around opening that facility. So some of that is the items that I would say were included from a technology perspective in CapEx for next year. Operator And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser Steve, you've made some considerable operational expenditures and investments in the business over the last few years, yet you are still looking for sales to be flat or your comp sales to be flattish or slightly positive this year bringing income down by a meaningful amount. Do you think you are getting a suitable return on these investments, and if you are not, at what point do you slow the pace of investments and potentially look to contain costs? Steven H. Temares First of all, we are not going to cut ourselves to greatness, so that's again we can't say that strong enough. The investments we've been making have made us significantly better. Are we where we want to be? No. But where would we have been if we didn't make these investments is the question that we have to ask ourselves. The retail is littered with people who didn't invest enough or invested later and made the wrong decision. So that's not where we intend to be. So we do measure each of the things that we invest in, we have expectations for them, and we think that we are a much better company today than we were 18 months ago, that we were three years ago. But unfortunately, we could produce better earnings in a short term by cutting expenditures but we wouldn't be a better company and we would be setting ourselves up for failure, and what we want to do is set ourselves up for greatness and that's why these investments need to be made. Michael Lasser And how are you measuring that greatness? Does that greatness come with your operating margin stabilizing at some point or are you just looking to maximize and grow gross operating profit dollars? Steven H. Temares Again, it will be measured by our customers trusting us to be the expert for what we do, for the home related product and for these heart-related life events that we handle. So being the largest player of what we think is the best choice when it comes to bridal registry, when we look at our baby registry, when we look at our growing decorating business, when we look at our large back to college business, our large new mover business, our camp business, all these things and being the best at them and then being able to take these customers over time into analytics, know who our customer is, speak to them on a personalized basis and to be able to be more important to them and be their first choice, and that's something that's going to be [indiscernible] over time. I mean we cannot be and we won't be just a transactional merchandise and be meaningful, so we have to be trusted by our customers as an expert in this way and that's what we are focused on, and the things that we are doing in terms of the differentiated product, all these services and solutions that we offer our customer as we try to always keep an eye towards operational excellence, are the ways that we intend to deliver this for our customer and to accomplish our mission. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler My first question Steve relates to the category expansion that you executed primarily online under the core Bed Bath & Beyond heading. Now that you are a year plus into that effort, how are you thinking about its success, and quantitatively is this one of the factors that's contributing to the outsized 20% plus e-commerce growth that you're seeing? Steven H. Temares Matt, the addition to the assortment is contributing to that. And keep in mind that much of that product is vendor direct. So this isn't product that we take into our system, that we don't handle, that we don't have the cost associated, we don't have the markdown risks. But yes, this is advantageous to us from a sales perspective. Ultimately, this has to be quoted in a way that it's meaningful to the customer, that we have the right content, we have the right features and facets, that it makes good sense for the customer that they think of us for these categories, we can market toward these categories, and we are ways away from being there, but just the additional assortment in and of itself we are benefiting from. Matt Fassler Thank you. And then my second and follow-up question is most likely for Sue. So you have a couple of acquisitions that you executed over the past year. I guess PMall is quite seasonal as we understand it. So can you talk about what the seasonal fluctuations in that business will do to revenue and earnings in 2017 until you cycle the deal? Susan E. Lattmann As you've noted, PMall is more seasonal from a holiday perspective. Each of the holidays throughout the year, it is a nice business to have. So with Christmas being a bit stronger and then the rest of the year there are holidays where PMall does do some volume. So that's all I could really say in terms of a seasonal perspective. Steven H. Temares Actually I guess we also gave the information on how it affected the fourth quarter, the impact it had on SG&A and the impact it had on our gross margin, and if that's a relatively strong time of the year, you could extrapolate from that as well. Eugene A. Castagna Yes, and we acquired Personalization Mall at the end of November. So the December numbers were in our last year fourth quarter. So we will anniversary those numbers in next year's fourth quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adrienne Yih My question is on the DTC and the direct piece of the business. Where is it as of the end of last year? And as you look out maybe three to four years from now, where do you think the penetration ultimately resides, the balance between DTC, e-comm and brick-and-mortar? Steven H. Temares You are talking about direct from vendors? Adrienne Yih Online. Sorry, online, online sales. Steven H. Temares I don't think we break down those numbers. That's first of all. But most of what we are adding online has been and will be VDC. So from that perspective, you can anticipate that the penetration from that part of the business will be growing. I'm not trying to be evasive, so if you want to ask that question again, I might have missed what you were trying to get at. We don't give the exact numbers. Adrienne Yih I guess let me ask it a different way. So this earnings cycle I would say this is the first time that we have heard the number sort of 40% to 50% of people's ultimate sales call it in the next three to five years coming from the online channel and 50% of it coming from brick-and-mortar, and it was the first time that I have heard that number kind of well, well north of 30%. And so it kind of begs the question, in three to five years if you're planning now and you're thinking about that, how you look at your real estate footprint and how you plan for that ultimate penetration, if that's even something that you philosophically think is going to happen? Is that a better way of asking it? Steven H. Temares I don't want to be judgmental. But I understood that better. No, but I think it's a good question. And just so for clarity, we didn't say 40% or 50% you're saying. That's an industry number you are hearing. Adrienne Yih Correct, and it's a first. Steven H. Temares And we do believe that – and we do see the movement to the digital world and I think it has been more aggressive than most people had anticipated, and that's I think accurate, not the 40% or 50%, I don't think we could predict what it will be. But we have been gearing our real estate in anticipation of there being less foot traffic and more expensive to run. And so when we look at doing a deal or redoing a deal, is that we look at over the term of the lease, and sometimes that might only have to be five years, seven years or 10 years to make sense, and we look at estimating or anticipating reduction in foot traffic of a number depending upon the market could be 5% to 10%, we look at increases in the wage rate by market, we know what's on the books and what's being discussed, so whether it's going to be ramping up to $10, $11, $12 or $15 and what numbers are going to be like to that of other people in our building that have to go up as well, and we model it out. And right now we are only looking to do the stores if over that time of that lease we see four-wall profitability and that it makes sense to have that store in the market and we'd be more profitable for having that store than not having that store, meaning if the business went to our other stores, where would we be. So we are downsizing stores and in some cases we are increasing the size and consolidating stores. But every store we do has to make sense from that economic perspective, and we started doing that years ago. So we are in a very good position. I wish that there was – I think that we would be perceived differently perhaps if we went to market and say, we are closing 100 stores or 200 stores, but it doesn't make sense. If it does make sense at some point, we will. These stores are profitable and they are more profitable, these markets are more profitable for having the stores than consolidating. That's the situation today and we make those decisions as we go forward. But I think you are right on both accounts, is that the digital world is ramping up and ramping up quickly and that the bricks-and-mortar world will suffer for it and there will be ramifications, and one of those ramifications will be reduced occupancy cost. And what happens if the occupancy cost gets reduced? Stores that don't make sense today, make sense down the road. And as somebody asked earlier, I don't know if it was Steve or somebody else, but the format is changing also over time as we are looking to add more experiential aspects to the store, give customers more reasons for being there, we are trying to with our Beyond store we are handling all the store orders, these online orders in the stores. So these additional services that we are trying to offer through the stores, the appointment scheduling that we have in the stores, like we said the reserving online, picking up in stores, so all this is a purpose of having them as well. But we are fortune because we don't have a prototype, we don't have a 30,000 or 40,000 square foot store, they don't have to be the same in every market. So we have 8,000 to 9,000 square foot stores and 120,000 square foot. So we size them by market and we make economic sense by market and that's how we try to run the business intelligently and optimize our bottom line. Adrienne Yih That's very helpful. Thank you very much for that detail. Operator Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Oliver Wintermantel In today's multichannel world and where pricing becomes more competitive and sales shift online, so how do you think about your historic like more on the coupon side, how do you think that works in a more promotional and more online world with the coupon? Steven H. Temares The coupons are available to our customers online. At the same time, differentiated product is critical for us. We don't want to be, we've never wanted to be all about price and we have always been driven by merchandising. It's a critical differentiator for us and it needs to be going forward and more so than ever, so differentiated product is important. But the coupon is important. It's the value that we give to our customers. So being at the right price is something that we are focused on, that we crawl the Web, we look at our competitors and we have a pricing group that we are doing dynamic pricing today. So, all these things are in place to make sure that we are at the right price. But differentiated predict and then also to the degree that most items with a plug and a lot of our product is maintained by manufacturers, the pricing. So that's generally at the same price in the marketplace. So it's a significant focus for us, and over time as we have always said, we want to get to being more specific with the customer, understanding what drives their shopping pattern and what's the value to them and make sure we are speaking to them and that the value that we offer to them makes sense other than a general coupon. But we are not getting rid of the coupon, we understand how important it is and the value of it is. But we do need to migrate over time as we get more personalized with our shopper to understand what categories they shop, what they bought, what they are looking for, where they are and their buying patterns, and make sure that we are dealing with them accordingly. Oliver Wintermantel Got it. Thank you. And just a follow up on online sales, can you give us maybe, now that you have reduced your free shipping level to $29, how much of your product is shipping for free today with $29 versus $49? Steven H. Temares You're talking about just for the Bed Bath situation? So, I don't think we share that information, okay. We do know and we look at the shipping revenue and as we test things where we need to be to make sense of moving that threshold. But we do, like I said early on, it does appear to be a sweet spot for us when you look at what the average purchase is and what people are doing online. And when we have tested otherwise, right now that's absent competitive forces, that's where we anticipate being for now based upon that due diligence that we have done. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel So the first question I wanted to ask, I guess somewhat of a modelling question, maybe longer-term, so gross margins now have been under pressure for a while, down I think 20 plus quarters or so, and if I heard you correctly, in the guidance you talked about maybe a somewhat better trajectory in next year but it is still down. So as we think longer term, we recognize you don't give longer-term guidance, but just conceptually, is there a point at which given all that's going on we should see margins flatten out or even start to turn positive again, and for that to happen, what factors would have to come into play? Susan E. Lattmann The gross margin deleverage that we modelled for 2017, that rate we did model to be less than that of 2016. In terms of future modelling beyond that, we didn't share that, but in general there's many factors that would impact gross margin. For example, it's something Steve just discussed here, it's the free shipping thresholds. It's also I guess what I would say is margin in terms of mix of goods and products that are sold. It's also I would say including freight cost and whatnot. It would also depend on what folks are buying and that mix of product that they chose. So given all that and those many factors, it's not possible to say this is exactly when we would see no deleverage in the future. Those are the items that we watch and we look at, and obviously that's what we are striving towards. Brian Nagel Great, that's helpful. Then a follow-up question, maybe hopefully [indiscernible], with regards to online sales, so as evidenced by the pretty substantial growth you've had online, you guys are succeeding online, but I guess the question I have is, and I know there is an easy answer to this, who are you competing with online? I mean is it just Amazon or are there other companies playing in your space that you are competing with? And as you look at that competitive landscape right now, maybe Bed Bath & Beyond has been late to the online game, so if there are companies who are performing better, perhaps your markets are better [indiscernible], isn't it just a [indiscernible] mission amongst consumers because they were there earlier or is there some factor you think that play [indiscernible] what are the reasons the other companies are performing better online? Steven H. Temares I could think that online the truth is that we compete against many more people, that there are people that look for credible retailers, but a lot of people are searching for items or they are looking for inspiration in the furniture and decor area, and whomever shows up could be redeemed credible. And so there is a lot more competition online than there was in the four walls. So I think that's the reality. And when you say that there are things that you could do to increase your market share, and we do some of that obviously that are rational for us, but there are things that you could do that a little less rational, you could spend a lot more on your advertising to buy sales. I mean we have competitors that do that and that's part of the way that they choose to do business. So ultimately, we believe that having the right assortment, having best in class Web-site in terms of search, content, assortment to services that are attached to it, that combined with the omni-channel experience is a winning formula. But that short-term decision whether you are looking every day, your ad to sales ratio on your advertising for your online is something that you could play with on a daily basis, and you can for short-term periods, you can buy sales but at the expense of the bottom line. And then you have to ask yourself, what's the stickiness of that customer, the lifetime value of the customer, you make a lot of assumptions and you test into it and you look back on to see if you were right or wrong. But the idea about the whole thing about market share is a tough one because when we look at us for example coming out of the fourth quarter, I guess there was a number of our competitors who are all great competitors, the William Sonomas, the Targets, the Macy's, the Kohl's, the Restorations, all these people had not great quarters. And so, are we gaining market share, they are losing market share or the people shop a little bit less in our category and so maybe the whole market share, the whole market was a little bit lower. We don't have finite numbers to know those answers, but clearly our digital space is growing at a rapid pace and we believe we are gaining market share. We think that we are experiencing in our stores is similar or perhaps slightly better than what we see happening in the general retail marketplace. So if those are correct conclusions, we would say that perhaps we are picking up market share, but we are not satisfied and it's very negligible one way or the other to really understand if that's the case. Does that answer the question, Brian? Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst This is [indiscernible] on for Dan. In light of all the retail store closures that are coming this year, several of these retailers compete in categories that overlap categories that you compete in. So given this, how do you assess the promotional environment that you see over the year and are there any particular quarters where you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure from heightened promotional activity? Steven H. Temares I don't think that we will know that. In fact I think that we didn't see necessarily or know exactly when Linens-N-Things are in 3-D or [Strauss] [ph] or [indiscernible] or Home Express or Pacific Linens or JCPenney Home Stores, [indiscernible] people were closing stores. We didn't know that Macy's was going to close those stores or that Penney was closing those stores or what's going to happen with Sears and Kmart. So we really can't tell you or predict a particular point in time that the competitive landscape shifts. But when it shifts, we anticipate that in the short-term there is some pain and in the long-term there is benefit. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman First question just on guidance, just two quick parts, the comp guidance, little flatfish to slightly positive for next year, can you just [indiscernible] what's the confidence? I know it's a slight improvement. Looks like home furnishing retail sales are a little weaker than they were let's say 12 months ago. And then Sue, can you tell us about what's the embedded EBIT margin in the guidance or a range? Susan E. Lattmann Okay, so starting with the comp guidance, we are coming off of a Q4 which was a positive 0.4 comp. I think Steve discussed some of the initiatives, whether it's furniture initiatives, personalization initiatives becoming more inspirational. Those are things we are working on throughout the year. And coming off that positive 0.4 comp, that's our model, that's where we see for now for modeling purposes and we will update it as the year progresses. Your second question I believe was on EBIT margin? Simeon Gutman Correct, yes. If you could just share what's the implied range within the EPS guidance? Steven H. Temares I don't think we provided that. We did say that the tax rate would be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016. Susan E. Lattmann We did. Steven H. Temares Interest should be relatively flat year-over-year, at least we believe it will be. So I guess the EBIT range would be slightly better than the EPS range on a per share basis, but we didn't give details about that. Simeon Gutman Okay. And my follow-up, if you look at back at 2016, could you have accelerated some of the investments, therefore that leaves some less to do in 2017, and then thinking about 2017, realize this may be a never evolving answer, but you've probably been asked multiple times, does this year represent the peak investment period, et cetera? Again, it's evolving, but any sense on that, can you answer that with clarity at this point? Susan E. Lattmann We provided our model which is around $400 million to $425 million. We came in at around $374 million for 2016. And so if you go back and you look historically, that's a peak for us at $374 million and we see that plateauing in that range of the model and where we ended up certainly for 2017. A CapEx model is fluid. Things happen throughout the year. Sometimes we are accelerating certain projects that we didn't originally plan and sometimes due to sequential basis we are pushing projects out. And then sometimes there are projects that we didn't even initially planned that we end up partway through the year make sense, whether it's for strategic reasons or financial reasons. So, we make those decisions as we go and that's our best model estimate at this time. Operator Our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas One of the things the Company has done very well over the years is to take products from teams that it has acquired like Harmon and buybuy BABY and integrated into the core Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Could you maybe talk about what inning you are in with Harmon and buybuy BABY products and some of the other ones, and what role, if any, you see for some of the online brands to have a presence in the Bed Bath & Beyond stores? Steven H. Temares I think that you could look at the Web-site to see the numbers of Harmon, where the health and beauty care, the four departments, I think it's a couple of hundred I think is the number there. I'm not giving any trade secrets. So I think there is an opportunity as we go forward for that. I think the buybuy BABY departments in the store are very few relative to that even. And so all those are opportunities to do more of this as we rollover real estate opportunities, because when we opened up those stores they weren't sized for those additional departments and things that we have in the store are very productive and obviously Harmon is commodity goods and Baby margins are in Bed Bath margin. So that's things that will evolve over time and the cost of the real estate and all those things will play into what the stores look like going forward. As far as the other online brands, I mean when we look at for example the PMall and the opportunity for them to create personalized product, we talked about them being seasonal and the opportunity for them to use all their processes and to provide product to Bed Bath & Beyond for example, that's a significant opportunity for us. So that's something that we are all working on so that we do see and we were growing personalized products in our stores. Again, that's another differentiator for us, so we think that's important. When you talk about somebody like a Decorist, we've looked at the ability to provide additional services, decorating services within stores. One Kings Lane had the studio in San Francisco, a studio in New York, and that's part of their – and they just opened up something that's a hybrid situation in Connecticut which we think was very interesting. So the ability to provide that decorating service in some of the Bed Bath & Beyond stores is an opportunity. When you look at the fact that we are growing furniture and home decor online, the ability to take some of that furniture, whether it would be One Kings Lane or other furniture offerings can show it to some degree in a way in our stores so customers understand that we are in the furniture business, so that's a growing opportunity for us as well. But in each of these areas is that we do have to figure out the right points of integration so the customer understands that we have the product that they are looking for, for the entire home and that we can be trusted as the expert for the home. So these are all things that are being done, some are further along than others and the ones that you pointed to, Harmon is further along, and Baby, we have certain departments in certain parts of the country that take advantage of the Christmas Tree Shops seasonal merchandise because they do such a wonderful job at seasonal. So you could find that in Bed Bath & Beyond stores. So all of this is something that very much continues to be a work in progress, but over time I think you will see more of it and we'll leverage it to a greater degree. Bradley Thomas Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Laura Champine When you talk about adding more furniture into your stores, what do you move out to make room for that, or is this new assortment just going in into expanded and remodelled stores? Steven H. Temares Obviously again you are talking about Bed Bath, because in furniture already you could find furniture at Cost Plus, you could find furniture at the Baby, obviously it's a significant and important part of the Baby assortment. That Christmas Tree sells furniture in Bed Bath, sells certain furniture. But again, there is different thought process and different things that we've been testing. But if you even take a look, I don't know if you have had an opportunity to see the studio experience at One Kings Lane, in a small amount of space you could really explain to the customer that you're in this business. So you might not necessarily sell much out of the store or carry much in the store, but you can really show the customer that we are in these businesses, we stand for these businesses, and explain that they can find it online, because even when you go into a Restoration, their offering is limited relative to you find somebody walking around with a tablet and they show you the breadth of the assortment. So really the key is, we don't expect, and we are not saying that we're going to be a furniture store, but how do we get across to the customer that we are in the furniture business and the stores don't become a disadvantage where people say or think you're not in the furniture business because we don't show it at all and the store explains to the customer that we are in the business. Laura Champine Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. David This is David on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question. Steven, I wanted to follow up with the answer you were just giving. So in terms of making customers aware of all the product lines and businesses that Bed Bath & Beyond stands for, what do you see going forward as you having to do to achieve that goal? Is it spending more in advertising, is it leveraging the customer less and doing more targeted marketing? How do you think about it and what does it mean for some of the operating expenses and capital expenditures going forward? Steven H. Temares For the first place obviously is that you could address it in our stores, that if the people, if our customers coming to the stores understood that we had an expanded assortment, that would be wonderful. So there is a lot of ways to do that that are not big capital expenditures. And then what we do already, and there is a shift in what we do, so there is a shift in where we spend our dollars and how we spend the dollars. So how do you – what are in your e-mail campaigns, what are in your CRM programs, what are you doing with your catalogs, what are you showing, how much are you showing and how you are describing to the customers. So, a great deal of it could be achieved through a shift. And then obviously it's spending more to the degree that it drives the returns we're looking for, that would be wonderful as well. So there is a lot of things that can be done. So really we haven't even addressed the customers that walk into our stores and really have done a sufficient job of letting that customer know the categories we are growing, and again, we haven't been in a rush to do that because we don't believe in many categories we are at the point that we are rushing to get the customer there because we are presenting the merchandise in a way with content and features and facets and shopability in a way that makes it best in class. So as we go down the road of shoring rooms and being inspirational and showing having the photography right and having the content right and having the chat up to speed so that we can answer the questions, and having our vendors up to speed so they could deliver appropriately and that we could deliver to people's homes with White Glove delivery and we could deliver out of our stores with the third-party partners who could pick it up and deliver it for the customers, and so all these things are more in place. We are not in a rush to show the customer we do something not great. So when we do things, we get to the point where we think that we're doing it well enough or great. The last part and the easy part will be marketing to the customer. David Okay. And then to follow, the logical follow-up to that is, when do you think most of those things will be in place? Steven H. Temares It's a gamut, because for example like even the delivery, the delivery network, to get delivery right we signed at this very local to take the last mile on delivery, and that if somebody is delivering the sofa versus delivering a mirror, that there is going to be in a lot of cases different delivery service. So again, everything that we are doing has a different timeline and it's not as if we are going to wait for everything to be perfect before we start taking particular categories and shouting that we are in this business. But literally, if you go online today and you take a look at some of the categories, you look literally at how we show it or how easily it's shopped or shopable, there are things that we have a lot to be desired. You shouldn't be when you are looking at it for upholstery or you are looking for sizes or you are looking for certain looks or feels, again, it should be easy for the customer and we need to really to make sure that we are attributing product correctly, that we are showing it in a way that we are really resonating with the customer in being able to do certain things in an inspirational way, so that it's close to best-in-class at least as we try to get and will get to best-in-class. So, each of these things has a different timeline. David Okay. Thank you. Operator I would now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. Janet M. Barth Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us again on our next quarterly earnings call on June 22nd. Have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

If you did not receive a cope, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom’s website at  www.broadcom.com . This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be made available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our first quarter year 2017 results, background to our second quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today’s press release. Comments made during today’s call will primarily refer to are non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock? Hock Tan Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon everyone. Well, we delivered strong financial results for the first quarter with revenue of $41.5 billion and gross margin at 62.4%, both at a very top end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $3.63 grew by 5% sequentially, while net revenue was essentially flat. Revenue was better than expected in all four segments. The benefits we achieved through business diversification clearly came through this quarter with growth in Wired, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial completely offsetting the typical negative seasonality from Wireless. The integration of classic Broadcom has gone very well and is now mostly complete. We remain focused on driving financial performance towards our long-term operating margin and free cash flow targets. Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the first quarter, Wired revenue came in at $2.09 billion better than expected and represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up slightly on a sequential basis, benefited from strong demand for Ethernet Switching and Routing products from cloud data center operators. This growth was partially offset by the continuing seasonal decline in demand for our broadband carrier access and set-top box products, which we expect to bottom in this first quarter. Turning to the second fiscal quarter, we forecast Wired revenue experience sequential growth a little bit stronger than what we saw in the prior quarter. We expect the momentum from cloud data center demand to sustain and expect a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. Now moving on to Wireless. In the first quarter, Wireless revenue came in at about $1.18 billion, better than expect and Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenues. Revenue for this core segment was down 13% sequentially, driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a major North American customer. Turning now to our projection for the second quarter fiscal of 2017, we expect to hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major North American customer. However, we expect to offset a significant portion of this decline in Wireless from a ramp of the next generation phone as our large Korean smartphone customer. This phone comes with an increase in Broadcom's RF and Wi-Fi connectivity content. As a result, we expect our Wireless revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be still sequentially down, but in the high single-digits better than the more typical double-digit declines we have experienced in prior years. Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage, which continues to be strong. In the first quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in at $707 million and this segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Segment revenue grew 26% sequentially, gaining better than expected driven by stronger shipments of SAS, RAID, and Fiber Channel products. As we foresaw, our hard disk drive and custom solid state drives controllers also had a very strong quarter. And looking into the second quarter, however, we believe this resurgence of Enterprise Storage has to taper off and hence flatten out. Having said that, backlog for Enterprise Storage products continues up to today to be very strong. But we foresaw what we foresee seasonality to start slowing demand in the third quarter if not in this -- late in the second quarter. Finally, turning to our last segment, Industrial. In the first quarter, Industrial revenue grew -- came in at $180 million, up 11% sequentially better than expected as we rebuild depleted channel inventory consistent with stronger product resales. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue and as we look into the second quarter, we are anticipating industrial activity to continue to improve seasonally and accordingly, we are expecting industrial segment revenue to increase by high single-digits sequentially. With all that to sump-up -- to simply sum-up, this second quarter was strong, revenue flat from the seasonally high fourth quarter of the preceding year. As we know look into the second quarter, we expect this demand environment for our products to continue to be very healthy and our outlook for this quarter's revenue to be virtually flat to that of the prior quarter. It is becoming evident that our broader and more diversified product portfolio has largely mitigated seasonal impacts to consolidated revenue during the first half of the year. This is certainly an intrinsic goal of our business model just that we did not expect to achieve these so soon. The integration of classic Broadcom is clearly going well and we continue to invest across all our franchise products. We are sustaining our technology leadership and our products are very well received by our customers. Our revenue trajectory from the first half of fiscal 2017 could possibly extend into the second half. Nonetheless, we do not expect that the approximate 15% level of year-on-year growth we are guiding for the second quarter to really be sustainable in the long-term. Our long-term operating model will continue to assume mid-single-digit annual revenue growth for the consolidated business. With that let me now turn the call over to Tom for detailed review our first quarter fiscal 2017 financials. Tom Krause Thank you, Hock, good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today that is available on our website at Broadcom.com. Let me first start out by saying that we are very pleased with the execution this quarter and specifically the progress we've made towards our long-term target model, which remains an operating margin target of 45% of net revenue and a free cash flow margin above 35% of net revenue. Further to what Hock was saying, we also believe that we can achieve these long-term operating targets based on a sustainable long-term revenue growth rate of mid-single-digits. Now, let me review the Q1 results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.15 billion, approximately flat sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the first fiscal quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62.4%, about 90 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to revenue at the top end of guidance and a slightly better product mix. This quarter's gross margin also benefitted from the impact of approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturing rights to a customer in our Wired segment, which is included in our original guidance. Turning to OpEx, R&D expenses were $664 million and SG&A expenses were $120 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $784 million, or 18.9% of net revenue. As Hock mentioned, we have not largely completed the integration of classic Broadcom and I would reiterate that we feel comfortable at this level of operating expenses relative net revenue. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion and represented 43.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $77 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income. First quarter interest expense of $110 million and other income net was $8 million. First quarter net income was $1.63 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.63. Our share-based compensation expense in the first quarter was $201 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 43 days, a decrease of five days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.34 billion, a decrease of $64 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $313 million for annual employee bonus payments for fiscal year 2016 and approximately $80 million of cash expended on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities including discontinued operations. I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, the business already demonstrated the ability to generate free cash flow close to our long-term target model of 35%, while free cash flow in the first quarter was $1 billion approximately or only 25% of net revenue. This does include I want to highlight the impact from the annual employee cash bonus payment as well as cash restructuring expenses and capital expenditures that as we discussed before running higher than our long-term targets. Looking forward, we expect classic Broadcom related restructuring expenses to continue to decrease as we finish this integration. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $325 million or 7.8% of net revenue. However, we expect long-term CapEx largely to fabless semiconductor company to run at about 3% of net revenue consistent with that fabless business model. As a reminder for full fiscal year 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing of test equipment to consignment at our CMs. A total of $431 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. Now let me turn to non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 62%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $789 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $74 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $106 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 452 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $223 million. CapEx will be approximately $290 million. And you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in the second fiscal quarter. We're also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and we presently expect to close this transaction in our third quarter of fiscal 2017. I'm pleased that we're able to reach an agreement with ARRIS earlier this quarter for the sale of Brocade's network edge business for $800 million in cash plus the additional cost of unvested employee stock awards. Following Brocade's recent results, we continue to feel very comfortable that Brocade's Fiber Channel San Switching business, the key business that we're focused on will generate approximately $900 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2018. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

I will now turn the call over to Baidu\'s CEO, Robin Li. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today\'s call. 2016 was a busy year, in which we experienced both significant breakthroughs and challenges as Baidu transitioned into the newest and most exciting stage of our journey so far. In 2016, we began to see glimpses of AI revolutionizing the Internet and traditional industries. The PC era and the rise of mobile over the past four or five years are in our rear view mirror. We are now living and breathing the era of artificial intelligence. We believe that AI is the new electricity, which will transform industry after industry, (3:18) new applications and products that we have yet to even imagine, and fundamentally, change how users interact with technology. AI represents an enormous opportunity and Baidu is primed to lead the AI revolution in China, as a result of years of investment and our position at the intersection of Big Data, technology and search, as well as our access to the best R&D talent in China and globally. To seize this opportunity, we have continuously shifted our strategy, organization, and resources to AI. And we continue to gain industry recognition. Just yesterday, MIT Technology Review singled out face recognition technology as one of the 2017\'s top 10 breakthrough technologies with Baidu as a key player. Launched last September, our artificial intelligence platform, Baidu Brain, is already deployed across nearly all of our products including Search, News Feed, Maps, Nuomi, and PostBar to name but a few. Users experience the magic of AI when they use Voice and Image Search or when we push targeted content in News Feed, recommend dishes in Nuomi, optimize a route in Maps, or intelligently (4:51) video content on PostBar. With AI, we are able to better match and predict user intent and deliver results that are more relevant and more targeted. By opening up Baidu Brain\'s APIs to the Chinese developer community, we are also leading the charge to transform traditional business into AI-enabled one. And our AI-driven initiative such as DuerOS supported by our leading Chinese language voice recognition technology opens up a new human-digital interaction paradigm. We\'ve announced a DuerOS powered TV assistant in collaboration with (5:37) and a DuerOS powered home robot named Little Fish (5:43). And we recently completed our acquisition of Raven Tech, a smartphone hardware start-up. We are excited to welcome Raven Tech\'s CEO, Jesse Lu, and the team to the Baidu family. Our AI technology is even showing signs of adapting humans. Last year, DeepSpeech, our voice recognition technology for Search, was just slightly better than human level voice-recognition accuracy at 82%. To-date, our technology has further widened the lead performing at 86% accuracy. In December, our AI capabilities were showcased on popular Chinese television show the Super Brain where our Xiaodu robot competed in three mind-bending voice and image recognition challenges against human geniuses. Xiaodu won two out of three challenges and tied for the third. Beyond our core platform, our leadership in AI creates vast opportunities in areas such as financial services, cloud and autonomous driving. We are investing in these opportunities for the long-term and have attracted some of the best talent to drive this effort to fruition. In 2016, we made tremendous effort to upgrade the Search user experience to ensure that users have confidence in the quality of content on our platform. To-date, we have largely completed the process of verifying ICP licenses and enterprise banking accounts for all of our customers. In the process of this cleanup effort, some portion of our customer base may not be able to meet our stringent requirements and we may experience a short-term reduction in the number of online active customers. The higher standard are healthy and good for our platform. And customers who comply with our stringent requirements may be able to enjoy a higher volume (8:02) and even more attractive ROI, and in turn, spend more of their budget on our platform, be it through Search, News Feed or our other AI-powered products. Our untapped customer pool also remains vast. With Search, News Feed, and other products serving both direct response and branded advertising to key accounts, small and medium enterprises, and local merchants. Our value proposition to customers is highly compelling. With hundreds of millions of user seeking and consuming content on Baidu platform, our content ecosystem is a key focus for investment and innovation. In particular, News Feed is a very exciting AI-powered product that have seen fast user adoption over the past several quarters. News Feed complement Search by bringing user\'s fresh, tailored content, creating a virtuous circle of content push and pull. Nearly half of Mobile Baidu version 7.3 and above users engage with News Feed on a daily basis and spend, on average, twice as much time in the app as compared to users who have yet to use News Feed. This strong traction is encouraging and we look forward to adding new app features and further improving our News Feed product. Another key part of our content ecosystem is our Baidu Brain powered open content platform (9:50) which we launched at the end of September. The (9:55) content distribution platform creates high-quality contents across media formats such as images, texts, videos, AR and VR, which Baidu host and operate within our ecosystem. Content creators are eager to be part of the (10:15) platform due to our vast user traffic and targeted matching of users to content. The platform has shown rapid growth with over 200,000 content creators registered. On the customer front, News Feed is showing early signs of being a natural incremental complement to Search. We are very encouraged by the momentum we\'ve gained so far with both users and customers. And we see strong potential for News Feed to help expand our customer pool and attract more large customers in verticals such as retail and auto, and more SME customers in verticals such as education and local services. Maps and Nuomi continue to support our Search ecosystem by providing reach, local services content. In the fourth quarter, Baidu Maps, Nuomi, and Local Express added breadth and depth to our points of interest database, bringing users direct access to over 2.4 million merchants as of the end of December, which is a 117% increase year-over- year. Now, looking to some of our longer term investment areas, we made progress in our autonomous driving initiative and demonstrated our technology at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen this past November. Over 200 attendees and journalists experienced Level-4 fully autonomous driving under real-world conditions in our fleet of 18 self-driving cars powered by Baidu AutoBrain, our AI platform for autonomous vehicles. Our teams in Beijing and the U.S. are making incredible progress on a daily basis with the accuracy of Baidu\'s vehicular recognition already above 90% and Baidu HD mapping exceeding 90% accuracy with (12:30) level precision. We launched our Baidu Cloud business in the second half of 2016 and have been making solid progress in building out our cloud product offering. With our AI, Big Data, and Cloud infrastructure at our core, we are able to provide our customers with a highly-differentiated value proposition. For example, Baidu helped the Taiyuan Railway Administration build up its intelligent logistics cloud platform by leveraging our cloud technologies and real-time Big Data algorithms to help optimize the customer storage, shipment, and drop plan. We\'ve also introduced advanced solutions such as logistics navigation, image recognition, and IoT offerings. Customer feedback for our Cloud service has been very positive and growth this year has been very encouraging. Our Financial Services business continues to transform the traditional financial services industry. Here, our AI strength is the crucial advantage for areas such as credit risk management and matching customers with the most appropriate product. Baidu Wallet, which serves as a user gateway to branch into other financial products expanded its reach with activated user accounts surpassing 100 million as of end of fourth quarter compared to 90 million as of the end of third quarter. With Baidu\'s innovative approach to Financial Services product, we are creating new supply and demand and processing new market all the while helping to support the growth of traditional industries such as education, travel, home decoration, and cosmetic surgery. In the education loans, we continue to dominate with roughly 75% market share. ITE performed very well in the quarter too with revenue and rapid subscriber numbers ramping up nicely. In December of 2016, according to iResearch, ITE\'s mobile app maintained its industry leadership with 125 million daily active users, 480 million monthly active users, 335 billion minutes monthly user time. ITE is an important part of Baidu content ecosystem, and we look forward to supporting its further growth. ITE has also recently completed the issuance of US$1.5 billion convertible notes of which Baidu invested US$300 million. Baidu Deliveries also grow rapidly, nearly doubling its GMV year-over-year. Baidu Deliveries\' differentiated go-to-market strategy of choosing select, attractive market combined with our technology driven AI-powered competitive advantage are helping to build a sustainable business for the long-term. As announced in our earnings press release earlier today, Mr. Greg Penner will step down from our board, having served as a board member since July 2004. On behalf of Baidu\'s board of directors, I would like to express my gratitude to Greg for his long-standing dedication and invaluable contribution to Baidu. And last but not least, on behalf of the entire Baidu team, I would like to welcome Dr. Qi Lu, our new Group President and Chief Operating Officer, who is joining our earnings call for the first time. Qi has been appointed as our new Director and Vice Chairman of our board of directors. As you know, Qi is one of the most experienced leaders in the global technology industry, and also a foremost expert in AI. Qi oversees our product, technology, sales, marketing and operations. I look forward to working closely with Qi to take Baidu\'s management and technology to the next level. Qi, do you have a few words to say? Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Thank you very much, Robin, and hello to everyone. It is a real honor to be joining my first Baidu earnings call as Group President and COO. As a leader in China\'s Internet industry for over a decade, Baidu has built up an incredibly strong set of reinforcing assets in terms of technology, data, talents and insights. This is a very exciting time, as China plus AI is an enormous opportunity for growth, which Baidu is very well-positioned to lead. We have a great journey ahead of us, and I have already been very energized by the amazing work that\'s going on here. I look forward to speaking with you more in the months ahead on many of the initiatives, especially in AI, that are underway. Back to you, Robin. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Qi. To conclude, AI represents a revolution in how humans and businesses interact with, and benefit from, technology. China plus AI will be a tremendous field of opportunity that Baidu is well-positioned to lead as a result of our long track record of investment and innovation. Looking ahead, we will continue to apply our expanding portfolio of AI-based technologies to an ever-widening range of applications, while we strengthen Baidu\'s role as an essential distributor of dynamic content on the Chinese Internet, from news and images to video, data and connected services. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jennifer for an update on financials. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. 2016 was a challenging year and a busy year, with proactive implementation of stringent customer requirements and compliance with the new advertising law impacting our revenue. These efforts are necessary, and will help us build a better user experience and a healthier, more robust platform. We largely completed our cleanup initiative in the fourth quarter, and believe that the most significant revenue impact is behind us. Revenue in the fourth quarter resets our revenue base, and we look forward to 2017 as a time of gradual recovery and growth. Over the past year, we have carefully reviewed our strategy and business portfolio. As Robin mentioned, the mobile transition is behind us, and we\'re at the cusp of an AI revolution. Baidu\'s strategic focus, organization, and resources have shifted increasingly towards AI, and we are excited to execute our vision in this new era. Given the strategic shift to capture the opportunities in the new AI era, we do not believe metrics such as mobile search MAU, mobile maps MAU, GMV and Wallet user numbers are indicative of our business performance. As such, this will be the last quarter that we will report that set of operating metrics. We always seeks to be open and transparent, and we\'ll continue to update the investment community on the most important metrics to track our progress. In 2017, we\'ll continue to invest to build our content and service ecosystem and execute our plan to capture the AI opportunity in China. Content continues to be an important investment area, as we continue to support ITE\'s growth and build out (21:16), (21:17) content platform to attract content and service partners, Maps and Nuomi, and key relationships with partners such as Ctrip will support our service ecosystem. Now moving to the financials, all number amounts are in RMB unless stated otherwise. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were RMB 18.2 billion, representing a 2.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2015, and flat year-over-year, excluding Qunar in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total revenues for the full-year 2016 were RMB 70.5 billion, a increase of approximately 6.3% from 2015 and a 12% year-over-year increase ,excluding Qunar. During the fourth quarter, Baidu had approximately 552,000 active online marketing customers, a 18.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2015, and a 13.7% decrease from the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the fourth quarter was RMB 35,400, a 14.2% increase from the corresponding period in 2015, and a increase of 13.1% from the previous quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 was RMB 2.6 billion, or 14.5% of total revenues, compared to 14% in the corresponding period in 2015, and 14.2% in the third quarter of 2016. Full-year 2016 tax as a percent of revenue was 14.7%, up from 13.3% for 2015. Bandwidth and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue in Q4 were 6.8% and 4.5% respectively, compared to 5.4% and 3.7% in the corresponding period in 2015. In 2016, bandwidth and depreciation costs as a percent of revenue increased to 6.7% and 4.4% from 5.6% and 3.9% respectively in 2015. Operational cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 were RMB 1.2 billion, representing 6.5% of total revenues, compared to 6.3% in the corresponding period in 2015. Total operational cost for 2016 were RMB 4.4 billion, representing 6.3% of total revenues compared to 5.8% in 2015. Content cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 were RMB 2.6 billion, representing 14.1% of total revenues compared to 7.4% in the corresponding period in 2015. Total content costs for 2016 were RMB 7.9 billion, representing 11% of total revenue compared to 5.6% in 2015. This increase was mainly due to iQiyi\'s increased content cost. In 2017, we expect content cost to step up at a similar pace as 2016. Content cost will be used to invest in high quality, licensed and self-produced content to support ITE and support Search and News Feed products through our (24:59) platform. SG&A expenses in Q4 were RMB 3.3 billion, a decrease of 26.4% year-over-year, and a decrease of 22% excluding Qunar over the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in promotional spending for Transaction Services. Total SG&A expenses for 2016 were RMB 15.1 billion, a 11.7% decrease from 2015 and a 5.6% year-over-year increase excluding Qunar. In 2017, SG&A will remain at a similar level to that of 2016, with spending shifting to Mobile Baidu and News Feed to further drive user adoption. R&D expenses in Q4 were RMB 3 billion, an increase of 19.5% over the corresponding period in 2015, and a year-over-year increase of 25%, excluding Qunar in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total R&D expenses for 2016 were RMB 10.2 billion, a 0.2% decrease from 2015 and 12.5% year over increase, excluding Qunar. In 2017, we\'ll continue to invest in R&D. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB 632 million in Q4 from RMB 341 million in the corresponding period in 2015. SBC expenses for 2016 increased 27% over the 2015 level and increase 60% year-over-year, excluding Qunar. Operating profit for Q4 were RMB 2.2 billion, a decrease of 38.2% over Q4 2015, and a decrease of 40% after excluding Qunar impact in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the full-year 2016 decreased 14% from 2015 and 25% year-over-year, excluding Qunar. Other income net was RMB 1.8 billion in the fourth of 2016, which mainly consisted of the investment gain recognized as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Uber China shares with Didi. Other income net was RMB 24 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, which mainly consisted of the investment gain as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Qunar shares with Ctrip. For the full-year, other income net was RMB 3.8 billion in 2016 compared to RMB 24.7 billion in 2015. Income tax expense was RMB 401 million for the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 8.9% compared to 12.7% in Q4 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the newly-granted preferential tax licenses for certain PRC subsidiaries. For the full-year, our effective tax rate was 20.1% compared to 14.4% in 2015. Excluding the share exchange transactions impact for the past two years, the effective tax rate was flat year-over-year. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid to high teens. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q4 was RMB 4.1 billion. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS for the fourth quarter amounted to RMB 11.43 and RMB 11.4, respectively. Diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS excluding net gain recognized as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Uber China shares with Didi for Q4 was RMB 6.49. Diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS excluding net gain recognized as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Qunar shares with Ctrip for the fourth quarter, last year 2105 was RMB 7.61. Net income attributable to Baidu for the full-year was RMB 11.6 billion. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q4 was RMB 4.6 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q4 was RMB 13.23. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for the full-year was RMB 13.2 billion. As of Q4, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB 89.8 billion. Net operating cash inflow and capital expenditure for the fourth quarter were RMB 8 billion and RMB 1.2 billion respectively. Full-year net operating cash inflow and capital expenditures were RMB 22.3 billion and RMB 4.2 billion respectively. Total head count on a consolidated basis including invested entities as of December 31, 206 was about 45,900, a increase of 2.3% as compared to the end of last quarter. Now, let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the first quarter of 2017. We currently expect total revenue for the first quarter to be between RMB 16.48 billion to RMB 17.03 billion, representing a 4.2% to 7.6% year-over-year increase, or negative 9.5% to negative 6.5% quarter-over-quarter. Please note, this forecast reflects Baidu\'s current and preliminary view, and is subject to change. I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Merrill Lynch Far East Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, and many congratulations in bringing Qi to the team as well. I have a question on News Feed. I think Robin mentioned that so far, you have been seeing some complementary results between Search and News Feed. Could you share more color with us on how your marketing clients are looking at these two applications, how they are allocating their budgets between Search and News Feed? Should we also see a bit of cannibalizations to some clients as well? Thanks. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Eddie, this is Robin. I think, when we see that News Feed is complementary to Search and will bring incremental traffic and revenue to Baidu, it really means that many of our marketing clients, especially when I mentioned large clients in the industry of auto and real estate, they were not able to find enough number of (33:14) traffic to show their ads in the Search context, but it\'s much easier for them to find targeted users in the News Feed context. And similarly, for providers of local services or education services that got a local focus, it\'s again easier to use News Feed to target their customers instead of using Search. So, our customers or advertisers can actually find more qualified traffic on the Baidu platform. Currently, we have seen very good adoption rate, many of the clients, marketing clients, are already coming up with specialty created creatives for the News Feed context, which is a very encouraging sign (34:25) like our News Feed product. And as I mentioned many times before, I think our business is very much traffic bound, not budget bound. So, the more traffic we can provide to our advertisers, they will have a more budget matching with us (34:49). Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. (Broker) Good morning, good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. I also want to congratulate you on hiring Dr. Qi Lu, as well as ending 2016 and putting it behind us. I was wondering – I wanted to ask you a little bit about strategy and also about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the strategic imperatives you may put in place over the next few years, and what that game plan might be? And relatedly, I\'m wondering if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of O2O? And then on core search, you\'re guiding to about 6% revenue growth in the first quarter. I\'m wondering what that might indicate for Search revenue? And also, if you can give us some color on just the pace of the recovery of the core Search business this year, that would be very helpful. Thank you very much. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Chi, I\'ll give you a big picture on the core business and new opportunities, and I\'ll let Jennifer address the Q1 growth guidance. I think we have entered the era of artificial intelligence, and fortunately, we invested in this area for the past five to six years. Actually, both the existing, the core business of Baidu and the new opportunities we are addressing, are powered by AI today, especially for Search. Five, ten years ago, when you think about search technology, it was very different. It\'s basically statistics-based technology. Today, search is almost all about machine learning, natural language understanding. So it\'s all about search. And the people will be able to express their interest or queries in a much more natural way. And we support voice as well as image as queries, and we\'re seeing increasing number of people using this kind of new form of queries to find what they need. These are all AI-based technologies. And News Feed again is also pretty much an AI, essentially it\'s the technology that matches user interest with relevant content. So we find we can leverage our strengths in AI technology to come up with much better products for our users. O2O, again, we reduced the sub fees as well as marketing cost for Nuomi and Baidu Deliveries. But we think this is an integral part of our core business. People come to Baidu Search for all kinds of things, including information, content and services, and Nuomi provides the perfect content for services. And we are fine-tuning the Nuomi content as well as services, and make them more friendly to the Mobile Baidu users, and make more opportunities for Nuomi merchants to show up in the Mobile Baidu platform. So going forward, we think we will be able to see solid growth in both our core products, which now includes Search, News Feed, O2O, and also new initiatives in terms of cloud, financial services, autonomous driving, and a few other AI-related new initiatives. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Chi, as you recall, last year was a busy year. Lots of the activity, particularly in related to addressing the customer base happened in the middle of the second quarter. So as we look at 2017, I think thinking about 2016 was a – not a very normal year, maybe looking and thinking about the revenues pattern from a sequential quarter-over-quarter perspective would be more meaningful. And that – I think it\'s more perhaps an easier way to think about the revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 largely resets our revenue base particularly for Search business. Much of the cleanup activities, the higher requirement for our customers are put in place. And the revenue impact that – as a result is largely behind us. So as we are going into Q1 and for the rest of the year, I think, the Search – we have been carrying out this business for years and it does have its quarterly pattern. And thinking it in that way as a normal pattern, maybe that\'s a helpful way to think about the business this year. And this year, as we are looking towards gradually recovering and we\'ll drive growth in the Search business, of course, other than the Search, we have the Feed product that is complementary to the core Search business. So that\'s perhaps, is helpful as you think about the 2017 revenue growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Thank you very much. And, yeah, I just want to join the chorus to congratulations of the (41:05) senior management changes. Just with regard to ITE, if I\'m not mistaken, we talked about a 110% growth in content cost last year. And I believe Jennifer said we should expect a similar degree of growth, and I assume that\'s a percentage statement. And if so, would that suggest that there is a further expansion in loss margin or are there things going on in revenues that would somehow lessen that negative contribution. And then, secondly, I\'m just curious, how would we view the margin profile of News Feed versus core Search both in these early days, and then where would they be on a steady state basis. I assume you have content-related expenses associated with procuring news flow. So just curious how those two margins might compare. Thank you very much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Alan. Yes, as I indicated earlier, content investment will continue to be a important investment area for us going into 2017. For ITE, over the past two years, we have invested strategically and very successfully in ITE\'s content. And as you can see, ITE\'s subscription user base is growing and that nicely complements its advertising revenue business model. So I think going into 2017, we\'ll continue to execute on that strategy. ITE has demonstrated, over the years, a high core competency in quality content selection. And going into 2017, more of the efforts will be spent in self-produced content, and that will help further strengthen and expand our subscription user base. From a margin perspective for ITE, over the past two years, their margin is actually improving, and we expect that it will be the trend going forward. So ITE is on a solid path, and I think the investment is very warranted, and they have demonstrated good returns for those kind of content investment. Included in 2017 content, as you mentioned, you\'ve correctly pointed out, that we also invest in content for our Feed business. The Feed business product from a margin profile perspective is different from Search. Related at this early stage part of the investment for Feed is content related and also we will be aggressive in rolling out user adoptions, mechanisms for Feed to be more penetrated into the user base. So early stage monetization maybe ramping up, but at the same time, we\'re investing in distribution channels in sales and marketing as well as content for Feed. Over time, as we mentioned earlier, this is also a integral part of our Search service and that offers a bigger product selections for our advertiser customers, and also very importantly, offers more ad inventory if our users adoption is good. So early stage for Feed, but it does carry a slightly different margin profile, but overall, it\'s a complementary and enhancive to our Search service. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, and Qi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my questions also related to News Feed. Wanted to get a sense, does the 1Q guidance that you provided include any expectations from the News Feed ad contributions? And what is management expectation and target regarding how fast and how big the News Feed could achieve in 2017? And also given your comment on shifting to AI and all this content platform, and Jennifer you just mentioned about some spending. Just roughly, could you get a sense of how much the investment spend that we should expect related to this News Feed ads initiative? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Alicia, thank you for the question. For Q1, specifically, there is a – News Feed is a product that we launched for a few quarters now and early stage in monetization. So, for Q1 guidance, we do have a small part that is contributing from Feed. It will roll over the years over the quarters into 2017 as we\'re growing the user base, users time on it, the advertiser pool, and we expect News Feed to add more contributions to our overall revenue contribution. For investment related to News Feed, I mentioned earlier, content is one specifically related to building out the ecosystem and provide a rich content and good user experience as our users use the product and engage with our service. For News Feed investment, I also mentioned about sales and marketing related expenses. So, this is more for user adoption. The investment in AI particularly are more in the technology side and that has to do mainly with R&D expenses. And therefore, as I mentioned earlier, we\'ll continue to invest in R&D steadily and – that is more gradual, its competency build up, its talent, so – but that\'s not different from the way that we have been approaching R&D investment over the years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the core Search business. The mobile search MAU this quarter, the growth rates slow down to 2% on a year-over-year basis. As you guys mentioned in the past that Search is a traffic-bound business, now that the mobile search traffic is slowing down and PC most likely is declining, how should we think about Search growth outlook for the next two to three years? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think the MAU for mobile search have to slow down because we basically penetrated almost all the Internet users here in China. And Internet penetration rate when that\'s (48:22) more than 50% growth rate will inevitably slow down. What we\'re hoping is that we will continue to innovate in search technology to enable people to ask questions or – and have queries in more natural ways, such as asking questions in natural language or in the form of voice or when they take a picture, they can use that picture to search. This will increase the dependency of users to our product. So I think, overall, the traffic growth for mobile will slow down, but we think it should be able to continue to grow over the next two to three years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Qi Lu, and Linda. Thank you my questions. Actually I have one follow-up question on News Feed, I am wondering if you could share with us some metrics in terms of News Feed advertising? What is the current pricing policy fixed rate (49:46)? And what is our strategy to compete for user time spend with our News Feed product particularly in terms of user experience when competing against market leader? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, I think we allow users to create designated creative work for News Feed advertisement. Therefore, the advertisers have the power to name their own price. If they don\'t do that, I mean, when they show the same creative for both Search and News Feed, we will typically apply a smart discount to the cost-per-click on the News Feed. So, on average, the click price for News Feed is meaningfully lower than that of Search. We are thinking about probably half of the Search related click price. Right now the ad load on our News Feed is relatively low and user experience has been very good with our Search-related customers at those creative dedicated for News Feed. Operator All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. Jennifer, you talked about MAU and GMV being less relevant for gauging success of business. What would be the relevant metrics you\'d look at going forward? And could you give us a sense of which ones are the ones that you would share with us going forward? And a question for Robin, Robin you made them push into software and hardware AI applications including the acquisition of Raven Technology and the establishment of few business units. How do you see this evolve, and could we talk about the shape and size of this opportunity? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes, with regards to the operating metrics as we mentioned earlier, the mobile transition is pretty much behind us. And our services are very much penetrated into the current Internet population in China. And also related to Nuomi services, it helps provide a service related content for our Search ecosystem and GMV won\'t be a meaningful target or objective for us. And so, we will always seek to be transparent and open with our business performance and provide relevant indicative metrics to give you insights into our business. We will – as we develop and focus on the ecosystem for Search, the service of the Feed product, information such as you know what we commented on how many parties are registered with (53:43) that helped build our content ecosystem. We talked about how much of our Mobile Baidu users are using the Feed products and we might share more insights as our product is tracking and giving us – giving the indicative insights into the business. So with meaningful metrics that we feel is reflective of our business, we will be very open and transparent about that, as we have always been doing so. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, on the hardware-software integration, I think this is one of the most important characteristic of AI era. With this kind integration, lot of innovations become possible, and the user experience is significantly improved based on that. That\'s why we are investing in both hardware and software for AI-related technologies. That its true for the mobile platform, but it\'s also true for the home environment as well as auto environment. For example, when you\'re at home, we mentioned we have collaborated with (55:15) when you\'re watching a TV show, you can instantly ask "who is that actor" in natural language will be able to find the answer for you. And in car environment, we have CoDriver, we have CarLife, which integrate a lot of Internet and AI voice-based command in those environment. That\'s just a couple of examples, when you integrate software with hardware, what could be possible going forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions. So I\'ve got question regarding your Transaction and related service. I think that the GMV declined sequentially by RMB 1.3 billion, but you also mentioned that your Transaction Service reduced operating margin by 21.8% versus 23.8% last quarter. So, just wondering, why is it that the related losses expanded while GMV scale contracted? And also, what\'s the management guidance for the margin for this year? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. For Q4, I think the margin impact from Transaction Services is also have to do with the overall base business. As you recall, our Search service – our service is sequentially a slight decrease. Normally in Q4 we would have increased, but because of all the activities going on, we didn\'t grow our revenue in Q4 per se. So I think that sets the base, and the component for Transaction Services, even if it stays similar with our continued investment in R&D and all that, that would translate into a bigger impact. At the same time, just looking at the Transaction Services, within it, we have reduced the spending for Nuomi-related promotional expenses. But at the same time, we see good traction on the Takeout Delivery service, that continues to do well. And also included in Transaction Service is Financial Services, and we\'re growing that business very nicely too. And so, I think our strategy is quite clear, and components of the Transaction Services, different elements are performing differently. And I think, as we go into 2017, it is quite clear. I think it\'s not the whole package that you\'re focused on GMV and Nuomi can help Search ecosystem on the service content side, and both Takeout Delivery service and FSG, Financial Services, can also take advantage of the AI technology and enable business growth, and also good user experience. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Dr. Lu, Jennifer, and thanks for taking my question. The question is regarding our paid subscription business on ITE. So you\'ve been actually sharing with the – some updated paid subscribers numbers, I remember by 2Q last year, we have reached the target of roughly 20 million, which is the leader across the sectors. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that. And also, regarding the comments about the cost structure possibility for ITE, I think – are we looking into the possibility that ITE can be close to breakeven in the next year or two? And also, a quick follow-up on the content spend guidance comments you have just now regarding the similar level of increase, is it related to the – referring to the percentage terms increase year-over-year, or about absolute amount of incremental cost run rate hike? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. On the ITE membership question, number of subscribers continue to grow at a very rapid rate. And we believe we are solidly number one in terms of subscription revenue, and will continue to go very fast. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think, on your other comment, specifically for content cost for 2017, what we were trying to provide you some color is, it will increase at the same rate, very similar rate compared to last year. So over the past two years, steadily, content cost have been following similar increase in investment levels. ITE, as we mentioned, ITE is doing well in its business, both on the user front as well as revenue front, and we are the market leader. So, I think the business has demonstrated a two-engine – two-powered engine revenue source. And I think in near term, we\'ll continue to invest in content and differentiate ITE as a service, and it\'s tracking very well. Operator Thank you. Our next question from the line of Ella Ji from China Renaissance. Please go ahead. Ella Ji - China Renaissance Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question for Dr. Lu Qi. So I just wonder after you have joined the company for several weeks, what do you think would be your to do list for 2017. Is there any specific strategy that you can share with us? And then, as an ordinary user as we use Baidu product, what should we expect to see differently going forward? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. First of all, thank you very much for your question. It seems I\'ve been here only for few weeks. I would say, I\'ve been able to spend lot of time with Robin thinking about our overall company\'s long-term strategy, particularly in the context of AI and China. And the focus is to land the opportunity in concrete user experience and concrete economic opportunities. And that will take some time to unfold and evolve, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. I look forward to the opportunity of – in coming months speaking to many of you about those ongoing initiatives. And I have full confidence over time, they will generate real user values and economic opportunities for company. And that\'s perhaps what I\'m able to say at the time for now, but I do very much appreciate your question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Huang from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Wendy Huang - Macquarie Capital Ltd. Thank you. So, I have three housekeeping questions. The first, can you give us update about the Search revenue breakdown between the mobile and PC? And also how has the pricing gap between the two actually evolved over time in terms of CPM? And secondly, the number of advertisers seem to be the lowest point in the past 10 quarters. I assume that was partly due to the seasonality, partly due to the lingering impact from the medical adscene advertising law. So, going forward, how should we expect the number of advertisers to churn in Q1, and when should we expect the advertiser base to normalize? Lastly on the ITE, you recently did a CD, but I notice Baidu only contributed US$300 million out of US$1.5 billion. So, previously, Baidu hold about 80% in ITE, so what would be the Baidu holding after this? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, Wendy, I think we reported on the mobile revenue contribution for our total revenue. So, for the fourth quarter, it stands at 65% and continue to grow. And obviously, we\'re living in the mobile age and it\'s undoubtedly, mobile is contributing more and we do see monetization power on the mobile front growing at a much faster pace compared to PC, and it\'s close to be – we expect that to exceed PC\'s monetization capability, not very soon. On the customer front, yes, I mean, I think you understand last year we went through the whole review of our customer base, have much higher and stringent requirements for our customers. And for particularly, the ICT license and the bank account validation for enterprises, basically we block out individuals who do business, search engine marketing business on our platforms. So having raised the bar is no doubt that some of the customers may not meet that requirement. But we know it\'s good for our user experience, it\'s good for the business long-term, and that\'s what we\'d do. At the same time, we know the addressable market for the customers that we can service is vast and we are innovative on the product side. So not only Search with Feed products, there is much more inventories for advertisers and that can serve both brand players as well as the smaller players. So we expect our customer pool to be able to grow. We will continue to have the high requirement for our customers and gradually build up our customer base, assuring that we have high quality advertisers with us. For ITE, yes, Baidu will continue to strongly support ITE, and ITE is a very important content provider for our Search ecosystem. With this transaction, Baidu continues to have a majority ownership of ITE. Operator All right. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please go ahead. Thomas Chong - BOCI Research Ltd. Hi, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, thanks for taking my questions. I have got quick question about the (1:07:43) headcounts in 2017. Given that we are investing in R&D, and in particular, in AI, are we going to hire a lot more talent in China or from overseas. And Jennifer, can you give us some color about the headcounts trend on a overall basis in 2017? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes. We have steadily invested in talent and R&D capabilities is really a key differentiating and competitive advantage Baidu has over the years. And we have steadily investing in R&D talent. As I mentioned earlier, particularly in the AI age, with many of the AI-enabled services that we are working on, we will continue to invest in R&D. But I think from a overall head count perspective, if you look at last year, the head count overall has not materially changed. Obviously, with more mature business, we look to the business to produce (1:08:58) more efficiently and therefore getting more efficiency and productivity out of existing business. But at the same time redirect resources to invest in new areas. So, overall, I think our R&D expenses will be a bigger component of the overall head count and that is how we deploy and allocate the human capital. So, I think 2017 we should expect R&D trending in normal patterns compared to a lot before as we invest in AI, but at the same time, the company is approaching a workforce planning with the disciplined approach and getting productivity out of the whole way we approach business.

Our first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Merrill Lynch Far East Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, and many congratulations in bringing Qi to the team as well. I have a question on News Feed. I think Robin mentioned that so far, you have been seeing some complementary results between Search and News Feed. Could you share more color with us on how your marketing clients are looking at these two applications, how they are allocating their budgets between Search and News Feed? Should we also see a bit of cannibalizations to some clients as well? Thanks. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Eddie, this is Robin. I think, when we see that News Feed is complementary to Search and will bring incremental traffic and revenue to Baidu, it really means that many of our marketing clients, especially when I mentioned large clients in the industry of auto and real estate, they were not able to find enough number of (33:14) traffic to show their ads in the Search context, but it\'s much easier for them to find targeted users in the News Feed context. And similarly, for providers of local services or education services that got a local focus, it\'s again easier to use News Feed to target their customers instead of using Search. So, our customers or advertisers can actually find more qualified traffic on the Baidu platform. Currently, we have seen very good adoption rate, many of the clients, marketing clients, are already coming up with specialty created creatives for the News Feed context, which is a very encouraging sign (34:25) like our News Feed product. And as I mentioned many times before, I think our business is very much traffic bound, not budget bound. So, the more traffic we can provide to our advertisers, they will have a more budget matching with us (34:49). Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. (Broker) Good morning, good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. I also want to congratulate you on hiring Dr. Qi Lu, as well as ending 2016 and putting it behind us. I was wondering – I wanted to ask you a little bit about strategy and also about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the strategic imperatives you may put in place over the next few years, and what that game plan might be? And relatedly, I\'m wondering if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of O2O? And then on core search, you\'re guiding to about 6% revenue growth in the first quarter. I\'m wondering what that might indicate for Search revenue? And also, if you can give us some color on just the pace of the recovery of the core Search business this year, that would be very helpful. Thank you very much. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Chi, I\'ll give you a big picture on the core business and new opportunities, and I\'ll let Jennifer address the Q1 growth guidance. I think we have entered the era of artificial intelligence, and fortunately, we invested in this area for the past five to six years. Actually, both the existing, the core business of Baidu and the new opportunities we are addressing, are powered by AI today, especially for Search. Five, ten years ago, when you think about search technology, it was very different. It\'s basically statistics-based technology. Today, search is almost all about machine learning, natural language understanding. So it\'s all about search. And the people will be able to express their interest or queries in a much more natural way. And we support voice as well as image as queries, and we\'re seeing increasing number of people using this kind of new form of queries to find what they need. These are all AI-based technologies. And News Feed again is also pretty much an AI, essentially it\'s the technology that matches user interest with relevant content. So we find we can leverage our strengths in AI technology to come up with much better products for our users. O2O, again, we reduced the sub fees as well as marketing cost for Nuomi and Baidu Deliveries. But we think this is an integral part of our core business. People come to Baidu Search for all kinds of things, including information, content and services, and Nuomi provides the perfect content for services. And we are fine-tuning the Nuomi content as well as services, and make them more friendly to the Mobile Baidu users, and make more opportunities for Nuomi merchants to show up in the Mobile Baidu platform. So going forward, we think we will be able to see solid growth in both our core products, which now includes Search, News Feed, O2O, and also new initiatives in terms of cloud, financial services, autonomous driving, and a few other AI-related new initiatives. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Chi, as you recall, last year was a busy year. Lots of the activity, particularly in related to addressing the customer base happened in the middle of the second quarter. So as we look at 2017, I think thinking about 2016 was a – not a very normal year, maybe looking and thinking about the revenues pattern from a sequential quarter-over-quarter perspective would be more meaningful. And that – I think it\'s more perhaps an easier way to think about the revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 largely resets our revenue base particularly for Search business. Much of the cleanup activities, the higher requirement for our customers are put in place. And the revenue impact that – as a result is largely behind us. So as we are going into Q1 and for the rest of the year, I think, the Search – we have been carrying out this business for years and it does have its quarterly pattern. And thinking it in that way as a normal pattern, maybe that\'s a helpful way to think about the business this year. And this year, as we are looking towards gradually recovering and we\'ll drive growth in the Search business, of course, other than the Search, we have the Feed product that is complementary to the core Search business. So that\'s perhaps, is helpful as you think about the 2017 revenue growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Thank you very much. And, yeah, I just want to join the chorus to congratulations of the (41:05) senior management changes. Just with regard to ITE, if I\'m not mistaken, we talked about a 110% growth in content cost last year. And I believe Jennifer said we should expect a similar degree of growth, and I assume that\'s a percentage statement. And if so, would that suggest that there is a further expansion in loss margin or are there things going on in revenues that would somehow lessen that negative contribution. And then, secondly, I\'m just curious, how would we view the margin profile of News Feed versus core Search both in these early days, and then where would they be on a steady state basis. I assume you have content-related expenses associated with procuring news flow. So just curious how those two margins might compare. Thank you very much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Alan. Yes, as I indicated earlier, content investment will continue to be a important investment area for us going into 2017. For ITE, over the past two years, we have invested strategically and very successfully in ITE\'s content. And as you can see, ITE\'s subscription user base is growing and that nicely complements its advertising revenue business model. So I think going into 2017, we\'ll continue to execute on that strategy. ITE has demonstrated, over the years, a high core competency in quality content selection. And going into 2017, more of the efforts will be spent in self-produced content, and that will help further strengthen and expand our subscription user base. From a margin perspective for ITE, over the past two years, their margin is actually improving, and we expect that it will be the trend going forward. So ITE is on a solid path, and I think the investment is very warranted, and they have demonstrated good returns for those kind of content investment. Included in 2017 content, as you mentioned, you\'ve correctly pointed out, that we also invest in content for our Feed business. The Feed business product from a margin profile perspective is different from Search. Related at this early stage part of the investment for Feed is content related and also we will be aggressive in rolling out user adoptions, mechanisms for Feed to be more penetrated into the user base. So early stage monetization maybe ramping up, but at the same time, we\'re investing in distribution channels in sales and marketing as well as content for Feed. Over time, as we mentioned earlier, this is also a integral part of our Search service and that offers a bigger product selections for our advertiser customers, and also very importantly, offers more ad inventory if our users adoption is good. So early stage for Feed, but it does carry a slightly different margin profile, but overall, it\'s a complementary and enhancive to our Search service. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, and Qi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my questions also related to News Feed. Wanted to get a sense, does the 1Q guidance that you provided include any expectations from the News Feed ad contributions? And what is management expectation and target regarding how fast and how big the News Feed could achieve in 2017? And also given your comment on shifting to AI and all this content platform, and Jennifer you just mentioned about some spending. Just roughly, could you get a sense of how much the investment spend that we should expect related to this News Feed ads initiative? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Alicia, thank you for the question. For Q1, specifically, there is a – News Feed is a product that we launched for a few quarters now and early stage in monetization. So, for Q1 guidance, we do have a small part that is contributing from Feed. It will roll over the years over the quarters into 2017 as we\'re growing the user base, users time on it, the advertiser pool, and we expect News Feed to add more contributions to our overall revenue contribution. For investment related to News Feed, I mentioned earlier, content is one specifically related to building out the ecosystem and provide a rich content and good user experience as our users use the product and engage with our service. For News Feed investment, I also mentioned about sales and marketing related expenses. So, this is more for user adoption. The investment in AI particularly are more in the technology side and that has to do mainly with R&D expenses. And therefore, as I mentioned earlier, we\'ll continue to invest in R&D steadily and – that is more gradual, its competency build up, its talent, so – but that\'s not different from the way that we have been approaching R&D investment over the years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the core Search business. The mobile search MAU this quarter, the growth rates slow down to 2% on a year-over-year basis. As you guys mentioned in the past that Search is a traffic-bound business, now that the mobile search traffic is slowing down and PC most likely is declining, how should we think about Search growth outlook for the next two to three years? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think the MAU for mobile search have to slow down because we basically penetrated almost all the Internet users here in China. And Internet penetration rate when that\'s (48:22) more than 50% growth rate will inevitably slow down. What we\'re hoping is that we will continue to innovate in search technology to enable people to ask questions or – and have queries in more natural ways, such as asking questions in natural language or in the form of voice or when they take a picture, they can use that picture to search. This will increase the dependency of users to our product. So I think, overall, the traffic growth for mobile will slow down, but we think it should be able to continue to grow over the next two to three years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Qi Lu, and Linda. Thank you my questions. Actually I have one follow-up question on News Feed, I am wondering if you could share with us some metrics in terms of News Feed advertising? What is the current pricing policy fixed rate (49:46)? And what is our strategy to compete for user time spend with our News Feed product particularly in terms of user experience when competing against market leader? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, I think we allow users to create designated creative work for News Feed advertisement. Therefore, the advertisers have the power to name their own price. If they don\'t do that, I mean, when they show the same creative for both Search and News Feed, we will typically apply a smart discount to the cost-per-click on the News Feed. So, on average, the click price for News Feed is meaningfully lower than that of Search. We are thinking about probably half of the Search related click price. Right now the ad load on our News Feed is relatively low and user experience has been very good with our Search-related customers at those creative dedicated for News Feed. Operator All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. Jennifer, you talked about MAU and GMV being less relevant for gauging success of business. What would be the relevant metrics you\'d look at going forward? And could you give us a sense of which ones are the ones that you would share with us going forward? And a question for Robin, Robin you made them push into software and hardware AI applications including the acquisition of Raven Technology and the establishment of few business units. How do you see this evolve, and could we talk about the shape and size of this opportunity? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes, with regards to the operating metrics as we mentioned earlier, the mobile transition is pretty much behind us. And our services are very much penetrated into the current Internet population in China. And also related to Nuomi services, it helps provide a service related content for our Search ecosystem and GMV won\'t be a meaningful target or objective for us. And so, we will always seek to be transparent and open with our business performance and provide relevant indicative metrics to give you insights into our business. We will – as we develop and focus on the ecosystem for Search, the service of the Feed product, information such as you know what we commented on how many parties are registered with (53:43) that helped build our content ecosystem. We talked about how much of our Mobile Baidu users are using the Feed products and we might share more insights as our product is tracking and giving us – giving the indicative insights into the business. So with meaningful metrics that we feel is reflective of our business, we will be very open and transparent about that, as we have always been doing so. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, on the hardware-software integration, I think this is one of the most important characteristic of AI era. With this kind integration, lot of innovations become possible, and the user experience is significantly improved based on that. That\'s why we are investing in both hardware and software for AI-related technologies. That its true for the mobile platform, but it\'s also true for the home environment as well as auto environment. For example, when you\'re at home, we mentioned we have collaborated with (55:15) when you\'re watching a TV show, you can instantly ask "who is that actor" in natural language will be able to find the answer for you. And in car environment, we have CoDriver, we have CarLife, which integrate a lot of Internet and AI voice-based command in those environment. That\'s just a couple of examples, when you integrate software with hardware, what could be possible going forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions. So I\'ve got question regarding your Transaction and related service. I think that the GMV declined sequentially by RMB 1.3 billion, but you also mentioned that your Transaction Service reduced operating margin by 21.8% versus 23.8% last quarter. So, just wondering, why is it that the related losses expanded while GMV scale contracted? And also, what\'s the management guidance for the margin for this year? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. For Q4, I think the margin impact from Transaction Services is also have to do with the overall base business. As you recall, our Search service – our service is sequentially a slight decrease. Normally in Q4 we would have increased, but because of all the activities going on, we didn\'t grow our revenue in Q4 per se. So I think that sets the base, and the component for Transaction Services, even if it stays similar with our continued investment in R&D and all that, that would translate into a bigger impact. At the same time, just looking at the Transaction Services, within it, we have reduced the spending for Nuomi-related promotional expenses. But at the same time, we see good traction on the Takeout Delivery service, that continues to do well. And also included in Transaction Service is Financial Services, and we\'re growing that business very nicely too. And so, I think our strategy is quite clear, and components of the Transaction Services, different elements are performing differently. And I think, as we go into 2017, it is quite clear. I think it\'s not the whole package that you\'re focused on GMV and Nuomi can help Search ecosystem on the service content side, and both Takeout Delivery service and FSG, Financial Services, can also take advantage of the AI technology and enable business growth, and also good user experience. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Dr. Lu, Jennifer, and thanks for taking my question. The question is regarding our paid subscription business on ITE. So you\'ve been actually sharing with the – some updated paid subscribers numbers, I remember by 2Q last year, we have reached the target of roughly 20 million, which is the leader across the sectors. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that. And also, regarding the comments about the cost structure possibility for ITE, I think – are we looking into the possibility that ITE can be close to breakeven in the next year or two? And also, a quick follow-up on the content spend guidance comments you have just now regarding the similar level of increase, is it related to the – referring to the percentage terms increase year-over-year, or about absolute amount of incremental cost run rate hike? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. On the ITE membership question, number of subscribers continue to grow at a very rapid rate. And we believe we are solidly number one in terms of subscription revenue, and will continue to go very fast. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think, on your other comment, specifically for content cost for 2017, what we were trying to provide you some color is, it will increase at the same rate, very similar rate compared to last year. So over the past two years, steadily, content cost have been following similar increase in investment levels. ITE, as we mentioned, ITE is doing well in its business, both on the user front as well as revenue front, and we are the market leader. So, I think the business has demonstrated a two-engine – two-powered engine revenue source. And I think in near term, we\'ll continue to invest in content and differentiate ITE as a service, and it\'s tracking very well. Operator Thank you. Our next question from the line of Ella Ji from China Renaissance. Please go ahead. Ella Ji - China Renaissance Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question for Dr. Lu Qi. So I just wonder after you have joined the company for several weeks, what do you think would be your to do list for 2017. Is there any specific strategy that you can share with us? And then, as an ordinary user as we use Baidu product, what should we expect to see differently going forward? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. First of all, thank you very much for your question. It seems I\'ve been here only for few weeks. I would say, I\'ve been able to spend lot of time with Robin thinking about our overall company\'s long-term strategy, particularly in the context of AI and China. And the focus is to land the opportunity in concrete user experience and concrete economic opportunities. And that will take some time to unfold and evolve, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. I look forward to the opportunity of – in coming months speaking to many of you about those ongoing initiatives. And I have full confidence over time, they will generate real user values and economic opportunities for company. And that\'s perhaps what I\'m able to say at the time for now, but I do very much appreciate your question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Huang from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Wendy Huang - Macquarie Capital Ltd. Thank you. So, I have three housekeeping questions. The first, can you give us update about the Search revenue breakdown between the mobile and PC? And also how has the pricing gap between the two actually evolved over time in terms of CPM? And secondly, the number of advertisers seem to be the lowest point in the past 10 quarters. I assume that was partly due to the seasonality, partly due to the lingering impact from the medical adscene advertising law. So, going forward, how should we expect the number of advertisers to churn in Q1, and when should we expect the advertiser base to normalize? Lastly on the ITE, you recently did a CD, but I notice Baidu only contributed US$300 million out of US$1.5 billion. So, previously, Baidu hold about 80% in ITE, so what would be the Baidu holding after this? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, Wendy, I think we reported on the mobile revenue contribution for our total revenue. So, for the fourth quarter, it stands at 65% and continue to grow. And obviously, we\'re living in the mobile age and it\'s undoubtedly, mobile is contributing more and we do see monetization power on the mobile front growing at a much faster pace compared to PC, and it\'s close to be – we expect that to exceed PC\'s monetization capability, not very soon. On the customer front, yes, I mean, I think you understand last year we went through the whole review of our customer base, have much higher and stringent requirements for our customers. And for particularly, the ICT license and the bank account validation for enterprises, basically we block out individuals who do business, search engine marketing business on our platforms. So having raised the bar is no doubt that some of the customers may not meet that requirement. But we know it\'s good for our user experience, it\'s good for the business long-term, and that\'s what we\'d do. At the same time, we know the addressable market for the customers that we can service is vast and we are innovative on the product side. So not only Search with Feed products, there is much more inventories for advertisers and that can serve both brand players as well as the smaller players. So we expect our customer pool to be able to grow. We will continue to have the high requirement for our customers and gradually build up our customer base, assuring that we have high quality advertisers with us. For ITE, yes, Baidu will continue to strongly support ITE, and ITE is a very important content provider for our Search ecosystem. With this transaction, Baidu continues to have a majority ownership of ITE. Operator All right. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please go ahead. Thomas Chong - BOCI Research Ltd. Hi, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, thanks for taking my questions. I have got quick question about the (1:07:43) headcounts in 2017. Given that we are investing in R&D, and in particular, in AI, are we going to hire a lot more talent in China or from overseas. And Jennifer, can you give us some color about the headcounts trend on a overall basis in 2017? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes. We have steadily invested in talent and R&D capabilities is really a key differentiating and competitive advantage Baidu has over the years. And we have steadily investing in R&D talent. As I mentioned earlier, particularly in the AI age, with many of the AI-enabled services that we are working on, we will continue to invest in R&D.

Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Earlier today, we announced that Jennifer will become CEO of Baidu Capital, an investment firm. Jennifer will transition away from her responsibilities as CFO, following the appointment of her successor. Jennifer has played an instrumental role in Baidu's growth over the nine years she has been our CFO. And as CEO of Baidu Capital, she will continue to be part of the Baidu family and contribute to building Baidu's ecosystem, which is crucial in bringing AI to real world applications. Jennifer's extensive experience in the area of finance, capital markets, technology, auto, financial services, and consumer industries will help bridge technology as well as traditional industries. And I look forward to working with Jennifer in her new capacity. Now, turning to the quarter. I will begin with a few brief comments, and then Qi will provide a business review, and Jennifer will present the financials. 2017 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Baidu, as we complete our strategic evolution to China's largest AI-centric technology company. We believe that a great technological revolution comparable to the industrial revolution is taking shape, representing a once-in-a generation opportunity that will create new commercial frontiers and transform a wide range of industries, such as auto, healthcare, education, financial services, and industrial automation. In the AI enabled era, the scenarios for human machine interaction will be much broader than what we've seen before. And as natural language understanding and image recognition power new information gateways, the new paradigms for human machine interaction will have significant implications for how people conduct their daily lives. I'm confident that Baidu's advantages in technology, specifically advanced AI research will position us to be the industry leader for the long-term. Search is one of the first applications of AI where search works to understand human. As the leading search engine in China, we have been fortunate to amass vast amounts of rich, valuable data in a market with over 700 million Internet users who speak the same language, have the same culture, and abide by the same laws. Moreover, we live in an age where we can finally match this data with powerful efficient computing infrastructure, and a deep bench of talent to make real progress in AI. We believe Baidu's opportunity to apply AI to real world consumer and enterprise applications in China is enormous. We envision a world where machines continue to learn about humans. In the not so distant future, using natural voice input or images to interact with machines will be mainstream, alleviating humans of the burden of mutant tasks. We imagine a world where your face is your identity and you only need to show your face to pay at the supermarket or goes through airport security. Cars will drive us, freeing up our time and attention. As machines become more like hyper efficient, real-time assistants for people, the mode of user interaction is evolving correspondingly. Just as the mouse and keyboard were the gateways in the PC era and touch is the gateway for mobile, voice recognition through conversational DuerOS will be the gateway in the China plus AI era. Our investment in AI is a long-term proposition with dividends that will be paid over the medium to long term. We're already seeing the powerful benefit of AI in our existing online advertising platform and in a more personalized, more image enhanced and more predictive search experience. Beyond the existing PC and mobile channels, AI will expand the scenarios and use cases for search in home, car, and work, and lower the friction for search through voice recognition, image recognition, and user personalization. Our strategy is clear and we're working hard on multiple fronts. I'll now turn the call over to Qi to go through our business progress. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Robin. To build on Robin's key points, operationally here at Baidu, we very much focus on building and applying AI technologies as the foundation of what we do, and the primary driver of product innovation and business growth. Over the past three months, I have spent the majority of my time working with our product and business teams to map out our strategy and the ways to drive high-performance execution. Our focus is two-fold, to enhance and expand our existing core business platform, and to lead the commercialization of AI technology across a number of AI-enabled new business initiatives, such as our AI-cloud, financial services, DuerOS, and autonomous driving. For our new business initiatives, we have gone through a rigorous and disciplined process to evaluate and select the most promising new business opportunities to pursue. Our criteria includes, category lifecycle, market penetration, Baidu's competitive position, differentiated value propositions, and our ability to execute. We will be shedding more light on the process and the progress of these new business initiatives, and sharing operating metrics as appropriate as we move forward. On our core business front, we are off to a good start, driving improvements in both traditional core search, as well as in our news feed product. Search is and will continue to be a fundamental user need, especially as we digitize more and more world information in our daily lives. We see much more room for innovation to deliver a better user experience with richer information using interactions as we expand search into more and more scenarios. For example, we are making great strides in enriching our search results, especially with video. In fact, now over 25% of mobile queries have rich video content as part of the search results, representing a material increase over last year. We are also making our search experience on mobile devices more natural and easy to navigate using touch. The experience is much more engaging, like that of our mobile native apps as compared to the traditional browser-based experience. This is achieved through intelligent filtering and the presentation technologies, based on our AI capabilities, in content and user intent understanding especially in more advanced areas, such as classification and object recognition in images and videos. With the twin engines of search and news feed, we have broadened our core product experience by complementing the explicit intent-driven, pull experience of the traditional search with implicit user understanding-driven, push experience of news feed. While we are pleased with the rapid user adoption of our news feed product with daily active users reaching 83 million this month, and the overall volumes of content distributions and the user time spent reaching a new weekly high, we will stay laser-focused on improving the user experience and building out our content platform, especially the number of content creators on our Baijiahao content platform has surpassed 450,000, more than doubling over last quarter, becoming an increasingly important part of the Baidu overall information ecosystem. Now, speak of ecosystem. Maps, Nuomi, and the Local Express continue to play a vital role in connecting users with local content and services, and helping local businesses connect with users through our search, feed and advertising products. Operationally in Q1, we consolidated Nuomi into our core business. Going forward, our focus for Nuomi will be building more and a better content of our local services and the monetization through advertising through Local Express, instead of just transactional business. All of these improvements to our core products and ecosystem are reflected in the growing engagement of our users, with the ratio of mobile search daily active users to monthly active users showing a clear upward trend. On the commercial product front, we added upgrades to our search ad platform, making click to connect ad formats available across search, Union and the news feed. This has yielded a notable lift in monetization. We are also actively developing and applying AI technologies across a number of key areas such as ad targeting, creative and landing page optimization, which will contribute to increasing monetization capabilities over time. While monetization is still at an early stage for news feed, customer feedback has been very positive, they view news feed traffic as incremental to their campaigns. Late last year, we also launched a dedicated news feed ad platform to complement news feed bidding within our search ad platform, and customer campaigns through this dedicated channel is ramping up at a rapid rate. Now turning to AI-enabled and new business initiatives. We are making good strides across the board, and here a few specific areas to call out. DuerOS is our next-generation conversational AI platform. By design, it provides powerful capabilities to enable the use of voice in natural language to interact with any digital experience on any device, for any scenario. This is because for the first time in our history, AI technology enables natural language to serve as a general purpose user interface. While it is still early, this platform will have enormous potential relative to the traditional platforms, because it can run everywhere, and it enable users to interact naturally and easily. We believe we are the clear market leader in China. DuerOS has already gained great momentum in building out its ecosystem. For example, we have secured broad partnership to power conversational AI services for Xiaomi and the Vivo smartphones, Lenovo smart TV, Haier, and Midea smart appliances, HARMAN smart speakers and many others across rapidly growing number of devices. Home and cars are two high value scenarios to anchor the DuerOS platform at this early phase. Here we have made important investments in our Raven Tech acquisitions, as well as our Internet of Vehicles business unit. Both of which will help further establish the DuerOS platform and strengthen our market leadership position. At the same time, both in their own right will have significant business opportunities that we will grow into. In Q1, we consolidate our L4 and L3 and Internet of Vehicle Business Unit into the new IDG, Intelligent Driving Group. This will enable us to build out a common technology platform, shared services, and a consistent solution for all our partners. At the Shanghai Auto Fair last week, we announced project Apollo, an open, complete, and reliable autonomous driving technology platform that we plan to launch in July. This is a historical opportunity to apply our AI technology strength to create an open innovation ecosystem that will empower all parties in the auto industry to accelerate the pace of innovation, enable more win-win partnerships, create greater business opportunities in this vast and rapidly growing market. The response from the industry and our partners has been very positive thus far. It is a big step forward. Our AI-cloud business named as ABC or AI Big Data and Cloud has been gaining traction with our customers, who appreciate our AI value-added approach. Baidu Cloud builds upon foundation of cloud solutions of computing, storage and CDN. We differentiate by providing AI technology enabled solutions, such as Big Data, deep learning, video, IoT and more. Customers across media, financial services, healthcare and other verticals have expressed very positive feedback. This month at the Baidu Cloud ABC summit, together with NVIDIA, we announced the establish of the Baidu Deep Learning platform which will greatly help our customers and partners to enhance their capability in Deep Learning and AI. Our Financial Services business continues to grow as our AI and Big Data capabilities serve as key differentiators that can intelligently target and match users with the right products, identify and prevent fraud and appropriately assess credit risk through our continuously increasing proprietary data and modeling capabilities. iQiyi, which celebrated its seventh anniversary this month, continued its sector leadership with ongoing improvements in revenue and paid subscriber numbers. In March, according to iResearch, iQiyi's mobile app maintained its top ranking with 129 million daily active users, 490 million monthly active users, and 342 billion minutes of monthly user time. We will continue to work closely with iQiyi to support its growth as part of the overall Baidu ecosystem. Baidu Deliveries with its first rate service quality and clear technology advantage made a strong progress in the quarter, seeing healthy revenue growth year-over-year. In March, during the International Women's Week, Baidu Deliveries ran a highly successful special joint promotion with Yum China's KFC and the Pizza Hut brands. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our progress in Q1, and we are more confident and energized about using AI to elevate our core products and the business and to create long-term values through our next-generation AI enabled new business initiatives. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to go through the financials. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Qi. Hello, everyone. In the first quarter, we bought back about $200 million of our own stock. We are very confident in Baidu's long-term outlook, and this decision is consistent with our overall capital allocation framework. We had a solid first quarter with the business performing to our expectations. As we're moving from mobile first to AI first, we work to align our business operations by folding Nuomi into our core business. Nuomi will play a role to serve as part of the core business' content and service ecosystem. We'll continue to scale back spend for Nuomi, and shift Nuomi from a take-rate transaction based business model to an advertising-based business model, which leverages our core business. We do not expect Nuomi to be a significant contributor to margin drag going forward. Other components in Transaction Services such as Maps, Financial Services, and Baidu Deliveries are also part of our core businesses content and service ecosystem, with Financial Services and Baidu Deliveries very much leveraging our AI capabilities. Baidu Deliveries continues to show improving operational efficiency, and a visible path to sustainability and profitability. Consistent with our strategic and operational focus to build our core business and invest in AI, we intend to realign our segment reporting, and fold Transaction Services into our core business. Starting next quarter, we'll report Baidu Core as a whole and Transaction Services will no longer be a separate segment. As Robin and Qi have shared, and as we have been communicating to you in the past few quarters, AI is the core of our strategy, and is both the foundation of our existing platform and driver of vast opportunities going forward. We are continuously leveraging our existing technology capabilities, and devoting resources to our AI-enabled initiatives of enterprise cloud, financial services, DuerOS and autonomous driving. The majority of these investments are on the R&D front, which we expect to bear fruit in the medium to longer term. This year, we expect incremental R&D expenses over 2016 to be all related to AI. Incremental R&D spend this year is largely related to AI R&D head count. As a reminder, as disclosed in our 20-F form, we disposed of our mobile gaming business for RMB 1.2 billion, a transaction which is expected to close mid-May. After mid-May, we will no longer recognize revenue for the mobile gaming business. The mobile gaming business contributed close to 3% of total revenue in 2016. Now moving to the financials, all monetary amounts are in RMB unless otherwise stated. For the first quarter, total revenues were RMB 16.9 billion, representing a 6.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2016. During the first quarter, Baidu had approximately 451,000 active online marketing customers, representing a 23% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 and flat compared to the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the first quarter was RMB 32,200, a 27% increase from the corresponding period in 2016, and a 9% decrease compared to the prior quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 was RMB 2.2 billion, representing a 12.9% of total revenues compared to 14.1% in the corresponding period in 2016, and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Bandwidth costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 1.3 billion, representing 7.9% of total revenues compared to 6.9% in the corresponding period in 2016. Depreciation costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 823 million, representing 4.9% of total revenues compared to 4.5% in Q1 of 2016. Operational costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 959 million, representing 5.7% of total revenue compared to 6.9% in Q1 last year. Content costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 2.6 billion, representing 15.6% of total revenue, compared to 8.7% in the corresponding period in 2016. This increase was mainly due to iQiyi's increased content costs. SG&A expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, representing a decrease of 29% from corresponding period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in promotional spending for transaction services. R&D expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, a 35% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to growth of R&D personnel related expenses. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB 631 million in Q1 from RMB 309 million in the corresponding period in 2016. This year-over-year increase was a result of increased share grants to employees. Operating profit for Q1 was RMB 2 billion, representing a 9.3% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB 2.6 billion, a 4.6% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. Income tax expenses was RMB 405 million for the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18.6% compared to 25.4% in Q1 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflected our operating loss narrowed for some loss-generating entities in the group. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 1.8 billion, a 10.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for the first quarter amounted to RMB 4.65 and RMB 4.63, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 2.4 billion, a 1.3% increase year-on-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q1 was RMB 6.85. As of Q1, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB 90.7 billion. Net operating cash flow (sic) [inflow] (28:38) and capital expenditures for the first quarter were RMB 4.7 billion and RMB 1.2 billion, respectively. Total head count on a consolidated basis including invested entities was about 43,400, as of the end of first quarter of 2017. This represents a decrease of 5.5% as compared to the end of last year (sic) [quarter] (29:04). Now let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We currently expect total revenue for the second quarter to be between RMB 20.47 billion and RMB 20.98 billion, representing an annual increase of 12.1% to 14.9% and the sequential increase of 21.2% to 24.2%. Please note, this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, and is subject to change. I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

I'd like to now turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J.J. Bienaimé. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We begin 2017 with a record-breaking quarter and a 28% increase in top line revenues to $304 million driven by the growth of each product in our commercial pipeline. In the quarter, our GAAP net loss was reduced to $16 million and we reported a non-GAAP income of $35 million. In addition in the quarter, our commercial organization not only focused on growing the base business, but also prepared for the launch of our six approved product, Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 which is a form of Batten disease. So we are very pleased to have received this approval last week from the FDA and also a positive CHMP opinion from the European health authorities in the prior week. The collaborative interaction we had with both agencies, who have the review process, illustrates a fairly even therapy that treats rare and ultra rare disorders, not to mention the tremendous unmet medical need for these patients. The flexibility shown by both the U.S. and EU is an important reminder of the value that targeted therapy can make in molecularly well-defined patient population. Our commercial organization has commenced the commercial launch of Brineura in the U.S. and we look forward to starting our commercial rollouts in the rest of the world territories following an approval in Europe, which should come at the end of the second quarter. Needless to say, we are very thrilled for families who are in the need of Brineura, and we wanted to thank everyone who helped execute this rapid approval. For the remainder of 2017, we look forward to advancing all of our development pipeline programs, including BMN 270 gene therapy for hemophilia A. In July at the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis or ISTH in Berlin, we plan to give you an update on this program including data on the seven 6 x 1013 vg/kg high-dose patients all of whom have been already in therapy for at least a year now. We will send our details shortly for investor event on July 10, so stay tuned for more information as we get closer to this event. Later this quarter, we'll be on track to file our BLA for pegvaliase which is our next potential approval, and in addition, the vosoritide and BMN 250 programs continue to advance. In conclusion, we begin 2017 having achieved the goals we anticipated and for the remainder of the year, we look forward to moving all of our patent programs forward, which Hank will review shortly. With last week's approval of Brineura, we now have six commercial products, making BioMarin the pure-play leader in the field of rare and ultra-rare disorders. The financial results announced today demonstrate our commitment to moving toward profitability through our ability to grow the top-line and manage expenses, while still continuing to invest in developing innovative new products for rare and ultra-rare disorders. And now we'll turn the call to Jeff who will review the commercial business in more detail. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, J.J. In addition to being extremely pleased with the financial results in the first quarter, the commercial organization has begun the U.S. launch of Brineura. Bearing in mind the nuances of treating the CLN2 patient population as we shared last week, our strategy is focused on building disease awareness and facilitating diagnosis of children early in the course of the disease. Our ultimate goal is to get children diagnosed when they are candidates that maximally benefit from Brineura. Over time, we anticipate more and earlier diagnosis of CLN2 patients combined with the impact of therapy to lead to a substantial increase in patients for Brineura. Turning briefly to first quarter of 2017 results, we were pleased to announce an increase of 28% year-over-year total BioMarin revenues. Starting with Vimizim, net product revenues increased to $106 million in the quarter, a 45% year-over-year increase primarily driven by 31% growth in new patients on therapy. Some forward buying positively impacted the quarter for markets in the Middle East and South Korea. While we received Q1 orders from Brazil for each of Vimizim and Naglazyme, we continue to expect the inconsistent order patterns could persist from Brazil this year. Year-over-year patient numbers increased by 250, and in the quarter, we added one new market for a total of 42 Vimizim markets. We are extremely pleased with the continued robust commercial uptake of Vimizim and look forward to further penetration in global markets. Turning to Kuvan. Net product revenues increased to $92 million in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year driven by strong commercial patient gains of 8% in the U.S. Kuvan business in international markets is performing according to expectations where we are identifying and pursuing growth opportunities. In addition to our EU patent that provides Kuvan exclusivity through 2024 in that important region, we announced on April 13 that we had entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical to resolve patent litigation in the United States providing continued exclusivity to October 2020. We view our leadership in the PKU market with Kuvan as an important opportunity for BioMarin in advance of potential regulatory developments with pegvaliase. Finally, moving to Naglazyme, net product revenues grew to $81 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Patients on Naglazyme therapy continue to show consistent growth with an increase of 9% year-over-year. Growth in the quarter benefited from forward buying in markets in the Middle East and the effect of a Brazil Q1 order this year compared to the absence of an order in Q1 2016. In closing, the commercial team delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2016 with net product revenues 28% higher than the same period last year. We remain on track to meet our full year revenue guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion and reaffirm guidance provided last quarter for individual products. I'm very pleased with the level of demand we are seeing for Vimizim worldwide. Our presence with Kuvan in global markets will be an important factor as we prepare for potential approval and commercialization of pegvaliase, and in addition, we are underway with U.S. launch of Brineura and look forward to launching in the EU upon a decision expected later in the second quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Hank to provide an update on our development programs. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. And it is hard to believe that I will no longer be including Brineura in my commentary now that it's on its way to being a commercialized product. Needless to say, we're thrilled with the recent FDA approval with a positive CHMP opinion and look forward to helping Jeff seeing brand Brineura to the children who need it as soon as we can. Moving now to development updates for our next potential approved products. All of our pipeline programs advanced to the quarter laying groundwork for their next stage of growth. Starting with pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria. At our last update, we communicated that U.S. health authorities were interested in additional immunology data and that we had chosen to update the safety database. We are now nearly finished conducting the analyses requested by the Food and Drug Administration, and there's essentially no change in the findings of the program we have shared as part of our pivotal study update last year. That is pegvaliase substantially lowers phenylalanine in patients. As we have said, lowering phenylalanine is primarily dependent on the level of their immune response, which can be safely managed through the induction, titration and maintenance strategies that have been tested in clinical trials. Importantly, longer-term safety data continue to convey tolerability of pegvaliase and continuation on treatment remains strong. We're making plans to incorporate the patient's voice in the review consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's increasing interest in patient-focused drug development. We believe this will be an important aspect of the review as current options for patients are quite limited and relatively unpalatable. Finally, the company is progressing on plans to support post approval commitments as may be deemed necessary during review. All told, we're quite pleased with the progress being made on pegvaliase and look forward to providing further updates as the submissions occur. Turning to vosoritide. When we last updated on progress, we enrolled the first patient on the randomized study that is an important element in establishing the benefit of vosoritide in promoting increased growth velocity. We're now finalizing plans to acquire final adult height data from a current population of achondroplasia, children and adults, to facilitate interpretation of longer term growth outcomes, also known as final adult height, and proportionality. To further our knowledge, we are implementing pilot studies to understand the relationship of height and function, support improvements in patient functionality. We're modifying our infant/toddler program to enable investigation of earlier intervention with vosoritide. Recall that obtaining information about infants and toddlers has become an increasingly important part of BioMarin's genetic disease development programs, evidenced by conducting a small post-approval study with Naglazyme, a larger study with Vimizim, and a small study with Brineura, and now a study in younger children with vosoritide. Most importantly, we continue to believe that vosoritide did present an important option for those patients and families who desire to improve growth outcomes and are unsatisfied with available surgical options in the absence of available medical therapy. And finally, turning to BMS 270 for gene therapy for severe hemophilia A, we have now completed dosing of six patients with a 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose and look forward to having some preliminary efficacy data. The focus of our updated ISTH will be data from patients who had a 6 x 1013 vg/kg dose, many of whom have been on therapy for well over a year. Recall that based on the 6 x 1013 vg/kg data and work by others, it takes roughly 16 to 24 weeks from dosing for Factor VIII levels to reach steady state. And this will be available in the 4 x 1013 vg/kg patients later this year. We're also preparing to update on long-term outcomes, quality of life, steroid use and liver function at ISTH either in presentation and/or at an investor event at the upcoming meeting. On interactions with health authorities, we've completed one round of discussion with the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency on the path to registration, working to harmonize feedback, finalize the program studies to support fastest and best path to approval. On the manufacturing front, we're well past shovels in the ground for our facility and believe material from this facility will be available to be included in the registration enabling study in the spring of 2018. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the productivity coming out of the worldwide development organization. We have learned so much over the past years on how to best focus our development programs to enable rapid and effective drug development in BioMarin. Coming off the recent FDA approval of Brineura after three years and eight months in development, my team and I are more inspired than ever to continue our good work for the benefit of patients with rare and ultra rare disorders. Thank you so much for your support. And I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to review the financial results in more detail. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Hank. I refer you to today's press release for a full detail summarizing our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Starting with top line results, as J.J. and Jeff have already described, total BioMarin revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $304 million driven by strong growth across the entire commercial portfolio. In terms of foreign exchange impacts, year-over-year exchange rate movement did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as losses due to the weakening of the euro and the British pound against the dollar were largely offset by improvements in key Latin American currencies and gains on our hedging contracts. Moreover, we expect that trend to continue for the full-year and do not currently project a significant impact to foreign exchange on full-year revenues in 2017. As Jeff noted, full-year revenue guidance is on-track for $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, which at the midpoint would reflect the 14% year-over-year revenue increase. The approval of reserve will provide important support towards our goal of ensuring year-over-year revenue increases throughout the remainder of the decade. Moving to operating expenses, R&D expenses decreased to $145 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $158.8 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to the maturing stage of development of our product development portfolio. We would expect R&D expenses to ramp up throughout the remainder of the year primarily due to the increasing enrollment in our vosoritide Phase 3 study, which started at the very end of last year and the start in Q3 of our registration-enabling studies with BMN 270. In addition, there will be increasing R&D investment in BMN 250 studies and in preparations for potentially bringing a new product into the clinic. Expenses in all of these programs should accelerate throughout the year. Furthermore, consistent with our experience after drug approvals, even though Brineura is now approved in the U.S. and potentially in the EU by the end of the quarter, there will still be R&D spending on this product while we seek regulatory and reimbursement approvals throughout our global territories and transition patient onto commercial therapy. Similarly, over 200 patients were made in pegvaliase extension studies as we prosecute regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Europe. SG&A expenses increased to $120 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $105.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected the continued expansion of dividend as well as increased expenses related to ROW Kuvan sales to support of our global PKU franchise. With the launch of Brineura and early preparations for potential 2018 pegvaliase launch, we expect SG&A spending to also increase later in the year. Turning to bottom line results, we reported a $16 million GAAP net loss and $35 million non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a GAAP net loss of $83 million and a non-GAAP net loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2016. Looking forward, due to the timing of the Brineura launch and the ramp up of our BMN 270 gene therapy and vosoritide programs, we expect an increase in both R&D and sales and marketing spending in the later quarters of the year, which will lead to increased quarterly GAAP losses and a decrease in non-GAAP income in the second consecutive quarters of 2017. Those spending will increase throughout the year as these development and commercial programs ramp up, we remain on track for full-year GAAP loss of $140 million to $180 million and non-GAAP income of between $30 million and $70 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. In closing, BioMarin delivered record results with robust sales from Vimizim, Naglazyme and Kuvan, resulting in reduced GAAP net losses and generating GAAP net income in the quarter. We expect the ramp up of our (19:27) pipeline products and the launch of Brineura to impact non-GAAP results in the second quarter with our 2017 non-GAAP expectation for the full-year is unchanged. Looking beyond 2017, we are driving for year-over-year revenue growth through the end of the decade and controlled operating expenses, which increased less than revenue and allows expanding operating margins and increased bottom line results. Now, I would like to open the call for questions and will ask the operator to open the lines. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask you about pegvaliase with the pending filing you have there. First of all, is it the same division of the FDA that just reviewed Brineura that's going to be looking at pegvaliase as well? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Cory. Yes, this is Hank. Same division, the Division of Gastrointestinal and Inborn Errors Products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, I mean at this stage of the game, I realized you're just kind of coming to focus a lot more in the coming months here, but what are your latest thoughts in terms of where you expect regulatory focus to be for this particular application? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. You're right. It's a little bit early to get into exactly where that's going to be. I think qualitatively, it's going to be in fairly similar places like it always is, safety, efficacy, overall benefit and risk. Now, the safety front has been well described. We've created a PEGylated enzyme that has a safety profile that's remarkably similar to our recombinant human products. Efficacy, we achieved Phe lowering in a very substantial portion of patients and only we'll be able to see an indirect evidence of a benefit on neurocognition. And I think the benefit risk concept has to be considered in the light of what's available alternative. And sadly, for so many patients in the PKU arena, there aren't very good alternatives. So medical food is unpalatable and unpleasant, has its own toxicities. And so, we hope that that will be the framework for evaluation during the review, but stay tuned for more considerations. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last thing, Hank, on this front, when you said you're looking to include, I think you said patient voice into the package. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you provide a little more color as to what that means? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, there are initiatives underway at Food and Drug Administration around patient-centered drug development and bringing patient's voice more in the process. You're familiar with us from the point of view of the open mic session at the Advisory Committees. You're also aware that the frequency of Advisory Committee is probably diminishing as time goes by and is less and less relevant in the rare and ultra-rare disease space. And so, we look for ways to, and so does the Agency, for ways to hear from patients in the development and regulatory process that helps make their interpretation of benefit risk most relevant to the patients, and to do that in a way that is more rich than simply the one hour in the Advisory Committee, which is diminishing in frequency. There are a variety of ways to do that. We have a lot of experience doing it, recently, gained a lot more experience doing that both in the U.S. and the EU with Brineura, and stay tuned for more specifics about that as the time draws closer. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, again, for taking the questions. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Question for Hank, on BMN 250, can you just run through the relationship again between heparan sulfate and neurocognition? And how you think about kind of the importance of some of the non-CNS disease burden going forward? And then just looking at the move from the 30 mg per week to the 300 mg dose, given the striking data that you saw at the lowest dose, what do you think the benefit is of moving to kind of a 10 times that high given that you're already seeing reductions in the biomark onto the normal range? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. So, heparan sulfate is one of the species of glycosaminoglycans that is not metabolized – tabolized, I should say, (24:39) correctly in the absence of this enzyme, NAGLU, and accumulates in brain cells. And its relationship to neurocognition impairments has really been best studied preclinically in the absence of clinical programs to document relationship between reductions in GAGs and improvements in neurocognitive outcomes. In animal species, what we have shown is that the direct delivery of the enzymes to the brain results in a reduction in measurable levels of heparan sulfate in brain tissues. And it's also accompanied by improvements in physiopathological evidence of neuronal cell health. And so, we think that the reduction by the delivery of the enzyme that's missing (25:36), the clearance of the storage product out of brain cells and the restoration of neural health will translate into resumption of normal cognitive development in MPS IIIB. As regards systemic or non-PNS or somatic manifestation of the disease, there is evidence of somatic impairment in MPS IIIB. Presently these morbidities are not as consequential for the patient as the CNS manifestations, and it's really the CNS manifestation that in today's world caused so much more morbidity. But one could imagine that if we have the same kind of effect on MPS IIIB that we have with that disease that there is the possibility that somatic manifestation for disease could become more pronounced. The modulator of that of course is just how much NAGLU gets into the periphery after an ICV delivery and MPS IIIB. And it's possible that some of the somatic manifestations may not develop, simply because there is some degree of enzyme delivered to the periphery. Stay tuned. It will take a while to learn more about that, and clearly, we'll learn more about that from the use of Brineura in CLN2 disease. And then finally, the rationale for going higher in dose on one level is the Phase 1 study to learn the tolerability of higher doses. And what we don't yet have evidence of about is the quantitative nature of the relationship between certain levels of GAG reductions and improvement in clinical outcomes. We'll be conducting some more preclinical experiments to better understand that. And as to what dose might be taking forward for commercialization, again, it's a little early to speculate about that so stay tuned. Hopefully (27:37). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Concise coverage (27:40). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No. No. That's great. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Next? Operator And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One commercial, then one pipeline. First, on the commercial, you did mention that there were some pull forward of the ordering patterns in Q1. Can you give us some sense of how that's likely to play out for the rest of the year? Is it all going to be felt in Q2 or is it more going to be spread over the subsequent quarters of the year? And then second, on pegvaliase, one for you, Hank. Could you remind us what prompted the FDA to require that the new immunology analysis, was it simply that a lot of time had passed since the trial or was there a more specific question that they informed you about? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Phil. Jeff here. I'll cover the first question. Wanted some evidence of forward buying, which is not unusual for these markets in Middle East, some markets in Asia, Latin America. Usually we don't see the impact of that all at once in the next quarter and we would quantify – as we've estimated that the impact on both Vimizim and Naglazyme to be a combined about $5 million to $10 million in the quarter. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good. Thanks. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And as to what prompted the Agency's request for additional analysis. It wasn't so much that it was driven by findings and discussions in the time before the BLA submission is driven more by the nature of the substance of the drug product. So to remind you PEG-PAL is phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a protein of non-human origin, which is pegylated to reduce the immunologic sequelae of developing an antibody response. The Agency, and it's earlier question we discussed, this is the same review division that is familiar with our Aldurazyme, our Naglazyme, our Vimizim. So, they are quite familiar with the immunologic responses to recombinant human products, but they are not quite as familiar with immunology, the response to a heavily pegylated bacterial product. So, we're talking about something somewhat new and recall also that some of our commentary about working with the DGIEP is that like other review division, they are stretched in for resources. So, knowing that the review time lines are going to be tight, it's really important for them to hit their PDUFA metrics. They have limited vehicles for extending submission reviews through major amendments. The agency requested that we provide as much of the immunology data upfront to facilitate their timely completion of their review. So, it was a negotiated agreement with the Agency about how much to give them in advance and how much to expect them to be undertaking as in process review. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Actually – okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding BMN 270, can you comment on steroid tapering or anything new need for steroid use and preliminary thoughts? Have you had any on the pivotal trial design? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, steroid, there is not really much of an update to give. I mean we'll cover this in a little bit more detail at ISTH. Just recall, the last update that we gave, I think the comment was everybody is off steroids, and everybody's liver function except for one patient, is down to normal and the one patient that wasn't already normal was at 45 with an upper limit of 43 or something like that. And so, there really is nothing new to report, and everybody is perking along and stay-tuned for a real update in the mid-year ISTH meeting. As regards the pivotal trial program, and I think there are sort of two poles of consideration. Clearly, one is, is that the potential for benefit is quite substantial in regard to reduction in bleeding episodes, reductions in Factor VIII use, improvement in quality of life related to reduced bleeding, reduced recombinant medications, potentially improved quality of life because of a reduction in bleeding frequency that is not treated as a bleed. For example, visceral bleeds are often not recognized as bleeds. So, there's quite a bit of desire to document that in a pivotal trial to support adoption and reimbursement. And we have every reason to believe given the data that we have obtained so far is that that's what will happen. At the same time, you've got an end point Factor VIII levels, which has got to be viewed as reasonably likely to predict a clinical outcome. And so that could offer an opportunity for an accelerated approval in the United States or conditional marketing authorization in Europe. And the virtue of that pathway is that it enables access to treatment faster than might otherwise be available if the product was approved under a standard approval mechanism. That's why they have accelerated conditional marketing authorizations in the U.S. and EU collectively. So, is it exactly what we settled on for the overall development program? TBD, but I think that's a little bit of color on how we're thinking about the opportunities there. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. And, Hank, just a follow-up here in MPS IIIB. When should we get the next update, and then any updated thoughts on patient epidemiology or the competitive landscape? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, on the competitive landscape front, pretty easy to say that the other folks are I think recognizing what we had recognized, which was direct brain delivery is probably a better idea than other approaches given the existence of a blood brain barrier and the need for relatively dramatic reductions. We are in the process of completing analysis of the patients in the dose escalation phase. We are busy enrolling more patients in the national history study, and ultimately, they'll flow into the treatment study. As to when the next update will be, I don't think we've penciled that out just yet, so stay tuned. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Another question on BMN 250, if you don't mind. So, Hank, I wonder if you could clarify – I know you said it's too early to talk about a final dose, but did you go directly from 30 milligrams to 300 milligrams or were there any interim steps in between? And then can you just clarify, is the expansion phase, they will all – the expansion phase – would that all be at the 300 milligram dose? And then finally on that, what's a reasonable timeframe to expect a neurocog result from that cohort? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So let's see, I'm going to do my best to remember the questions. So the patients were escalated from 30 milligram to 100 milligram to 300 milligram. So there was an intervening dose between 30 milligram and 300 milligram. And all of the patients in the expansion will start at 300 milligram together, the most information we can on the safety of high exposure and also the effects of higher doses on maintenance of GAG lowering. To remind you in the first three patients dosed at 30 milligrams, two out of three had heparan sulfate levels that moved into the normal range. And a third patient's CSF GAG levels moved into the normal arrangement to hover just above the normal range. So, we'd be very keen to see more data on longer term suppression of CSF GAG levels at the higher doses. Now, a timeframe on which to expect that update to be provided, I think again, is a little premature. Some of that has to do with the rate of enrollment in the natural history study. Some that has to do with the rate of transfer of patients from natural history into the drug study. So, it's really premature to speculate on when those data are available. I think also the nature of the question was when can we expect to see neurocog if there is a benefit. And the thing to say about that is that the primary outcome measure here is development. And if we see as good a result as we saw with Brineura, that might happen relatively quickly, but we don't know what magnitude of result we'll observe. So, that's also another complicating factor sort of estimating when there will be an update of relevance on NAGLU. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, that was actually my next question is, and maybe one that you're not ready to answer is, are there brackets around the magnitude that you'd need to see, at least in terms of what FDA is looking for or what you think you'd need in terms of neurocog benefit? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Well, what I can say is that we think that relatively low order magnitude reductions in CSF GAGs are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. And we based that on animal data that I referenced earlier in which you can't really impact neuronal cell health until you get to substantially more marked degrees of CSF GAG reduction. And we also partly based that on more intermediate impacts on CSF GAGs in MPS II and MPS IIIA, which were not accompanied by overt clinical benefits in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy delivered via lumbar intrathecal delivery. So, we think that you've got to push GAG levels down pretty far if not as far as you possibly can to achieve the dramatic effect that we like to see. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz from Leerink Partners. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us understand when we're likely to get the performance of the patients that are getting BMN 270 at the 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, as I said in my prepared comments, based on the observations that me and others have made, it takes about 14 to 26 weeks after gene transfer for liver expression to stabilize. And based on the timing of the doses that were given, we expect the data on 4 x 1013 vg/kg later this year. Now, I think what people are going to try to resolve to is what expectation to have for the ISTH update if the data are not there, what does it mean? It probably would only mean – and I'm saying this because we haven't arrived at any point of stabilization, because the presentation of data will be informed by whether it's officially mature yet as opposed to whether it's too early to make these data available. I would say and just remind people that with those patients, first three patients, we wait a little while before deciding whether to dose the next three patients with the same or higher dose. We dosed the next three patients at that same – what we're calling the mid-dose or 4 x 1013 vg/kg. And you can interpret that was because we're pretty enthusiastic about what we were seeing among the first three patients. As to exact numbers and exactly what's going to get presented and when it's going to get presented, we need to leave a little room for allowing the data to mature, and we're just not there. I know we're eight weeks ahead of the event, but we're just not at the event yet. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC All right. Okay. And then on vosoritide, it sounds like you were modifying the randomized study, if that's right and then adding some ancillary studies. Can you explain some more about what's going on there? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, it was really more around modified ancillary studies. The trial is in rolling now, one year placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial continuing substantially unmodified as we talked about it in the past. The ancillary studies are a program of studies that we've talked about in the past. We've talked about the functionality, proportionality, final adult height and safety efficacy in infants and toddlers. And as has been our tradition in the past, we usually concentrate on getting the randomized study up and running first, and then we turn our attention to the ancillary studies for the simple reason that the randomized trials usually provide about definitive evidence and the ancillary trials if they require it all for registration are supported at best. And so, the commentary was simply that as regard to final adult heights, we're building more contemporaneous database that relates final adult height in achondroplasia and relates final adult height in achondroplasia to functional outcomes related to proportionality of the functional outcomes. So just giving a little bit more specifics about the objectives of that portion of the program and then a little bit more specifics around the infant and toddler study by saying that it's very important in providing additional evidence of growth benefit as well as potentially neurological benefit of introducing vosoritide. And those modifications for that portion of the program were being undertaken. Now that we have so much more safety and efficacy data from doses in older children. So, again, the big picture is the vosoritide is progressing, randomized control trial underway, ancillary studies in support of decision making by payers by regulators and stay tuned for more updates as those studies get more completely finalized. Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC All right, great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two follow-ups and I think they're more just clarifications. Hank, on vosoritide, can you just talk a little bit about the younger kids studies that you're going to start. I mean is there any dosing work that you need to do there and sort of what's the age range of patients that you were considering and then – or if you don't need it to dose (43:19) physicians to start something where they're going to look at growth velocity. And then, if you could just clarify, because you said a couple of things about BMN 270 data at ISTH. We will see data from 4 x 1013 vg/kg (43:33) cohort and it's just unclear about the scope and size of that data or is it possible that we won't see any data from that cohort? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we'll take the last part first. It's possible you won't see any data from the cohort. It is also possible that you'll see some data from that cohort and it's just too early even recognizing that it's not that far away from now. Just you want to let the data mature and we don't want to present something potentially misleading as it is maturing. So stay tuned and then we'll do our very best to get you relevant information just as soon as we have it. And then on BMN 111, I don't know that I can be more concretely definite than just as to your questions, we're excited to say more specific. We're evaluating the data that we have on exposure and age to determine if its substantially likely that we would need to have different doses in much younger children. And the age range that we would be considering is – in a randomized trial, you're eligible if you're older than five. But we recognized (44:45) diagnosed, oftentimes either before birth or at birth or shortly after birth, and that families will want to know, is it safe to start vosoritide or when is it safe start vosoritide. Especially given that the earlier you treat a genetic disease, the better your long-term outcome is. So we're scrubbing our safety exposure response data from our existing population. We're endeavoring to push, in partnership with health authorities and our clinician advisers to progressively younger and younger children to establish safety and potentially efficacy. And until that trial is up on clinicaltrials.gov, I think it would be too preliminary to speculate on the exact final clinical (45:34) study. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Just maybe a follow-up or two. On BMN 270, it seems like you and one of your gene therapy competitors might have data in Berlin. Hank, maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on as we all try to compare across trials, what we should be looking for? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The non-cheeky answer to that is going to be – well, it's going to sound cheeky no matter how I deliver it. It's going to be the fact – it's how much experience in time do the various assets have under their belt. When we first – I think the picture that we have of BMN 270 now at the year-plus mark is substantially different than where it was at say the half-year mark. I mean just to remind you at R&D Day last year, I think we were presenting that we had gotten an effective gene transfer to some patients, but we're also in the middle of dealing with some liver function test elevations and some regulatory interactions around those liver functions test elevations. And as you flash forward, you realize that all that had settled out and hardly any of that was relevant. So I think, with us positioned so far out in front of the competition, it's going to be a little hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons to seize the time differences the two programs have. I think the second thing is to just remind that, yeah, it can be very difficult in the best of circumstances can compare drugs that were not studied in the same study. And so I suspect that the followers will be talking about how great their evidence is that stacked up against our data. And I would just caution that that's hard to do in even the best of circumstances. Our focus will be on getting our BMN 270 across the finish line and that's what you're going to hear from us. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up question in regard to the potential pivotal design for BMN 270, I know you've mentioned annualized bleeding rates. You mentioned Factor VIII levels. Is it possible for you to just maybe opine on the size of those studies and potential duration of a follow-up that the FDA might require? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can opine on practically anything. So I think you see the stabilization in Factor VIII levels, 14 to 26 weeks, the question I think the health authorities will ask is, is that long enough to be sure that levels aren't going to go dramatically up after that period or dramatically down after that period, but I think you can get a sense of a dramatic effect on Factor VIII expressions in half a year. On bleeding, there have been clinical trials that have led to approvals of products with the half a year of data. My suspicion is that in gene therapy on an important clinical outcome like bleeding, health authorities are going to want to see more than half a year of data on bleeding rate. I think the bigger difference between the two pathways is likely to be sample size. When you can correct the gene expression from less than 1% to in the normal range, it's not going to take a lot of patient sample to document that. If that's going to take a lot of sample sizes to document an 91% reduction in bleeding frequency either although that number could end up being a little bit bigger than the Factor VIII number simply because of the trial design considerations. So stay tuned. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And one question for J.J., if I may. What are the plans for the pediatric review voucher? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We haven't really decided at this time. A lot of the products we have in development actually would themselves be getting priority review. You don't know this time is pegvaliase will get priority review. So it will be in the equation but that's not the only thing. So, we might look at divesting this voucher, but again, we haven't made any final decision. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with the first one back to PEG-PAL and kind of anymore consensus about measuring neurocog or anything maybe on the more quantitative side that you can include in the package? And then I have a couple others. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Alethia. I think we've came to the pretty comprehensive story already about what we know about neurocognition which to just remind you is that there is pretty heterogeneous phenotype of cognitive impairment in PKU patients. The predominant form of impairment is inattentiveness, but there are also other neurocognitive manifestations. Some of those include mood disorders like anxiety and depression, but some of those also include dimensions of neurological health like executive function, judgment ability, et cetera. We concentrated on the inattentiveness in the previously conducted pivotal trial for the simple reason that was the most prevalent of the forms. We documented that the neurocognitive impairment in phenylketonuria in adults is not irreversible, but for reasons we don't completely understand, we were unable to document improvement in neurocognitive outcome in patients randomized to withdraw from pegvaliase compared to patients who were maintained on the pegvaliase after achieving a steady pegvaliase dose. That may pertain to the tools and that may pertain to the timeframe. So, we also demonstrated some trends in some of the more quantitative aspects of executive function, specifically computer sets, the tests of processing speed, as an example. We referred to that as CANTAB in our previous communication. And we're working with experts and agency to identify what could be used in a post-approval trial should that be warranted. And I want to remind you from my prepared comments that no definitive path has been determined for the application or for the approval. We are working in parallel with the agency anticipating and wanting to be ready for whatever post-approval commitments come our way. And so we're examining these issues very carefully and closely right now. We haven't settled on exactly what to do next in regard to measuring neurocog in PKU patients. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. And so on the gene therapy manufacturing facility, I know you talked about mid-year as kind of timeline. Is there anything else that kind of needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just kind of walk us through the what's next briefly at a time and last steps. And then the last question is probably for Jeff, around – can you talk about potential impact of Kuvan, of generics? Do you think it's like kind of a slope, or do you think it's a cliff and why do you think that thing? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So let's start with manufacturing. We got Robert Baffi, our Head of Technical Operations here on the line. So Robert, you want to answer that question on gene therapy manufacturing? Robert A. Baffi - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Sure J.J. Thank you. So where we are now with the facility is we've mechanically completed the facilities, that means all the major pieces of equipment have been installed. We go through a commissioning phase which will take approximately two to three months to make sure all equipment is appropriately validated and operational. And then we'll go into production starting in the late part of the third quarter, and eventually, as we produce and characterize that material, we will have to file that facility as with the Agency and that's the main reasons why the timing for bill of material goes into the second quarter of 2018. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Robert. Now Jeff to answer the question on generics? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So Alethia, I think you're referring to what would our expectations be in the U.S. market to... Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That's right. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ... the generic entry. And I think that we know very well how to characterize the generic entry for a traditional retail type of pharmaceutical. It's less clear what to expect in the case of Kuvan, because of our unique business model, and because there's not really very many, if any, good analogs to follow of specialty products with closed-loop distribution systems facing generic entry. So anything we have to offer on this one is speculation, but some of the things that we're thinking about are the traditional methods by which generics get rapid penetration and displace the reference brand may not apply here. We may have some advantages favoring Kuvan, based not only on the distribution model, but our relationship with prescribers and patients. And also, we are not underestimating the ability of a generic competitor to find cracks in the model. So, can't provide very specific guidance to you other than saying we don't think it's going to be exactly a traditional cliff like with a standard retail pharmaceutical. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. I also want to add that. I mean, of course, it was going to be depend whether or not pegvaliase (56:27) October 2020 in the U.S. and the extent to which some Kuvan adult patients moved to pegvaliase in the U.S. And also, I just want to remind you that the October 2020 date is only I guess the U.S. market. And for Europe, we think we have market protection until 2024. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ying Huang from BoA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for BMN 270 regulatory path here. Can you clarify whether you have had a meeting or you will schedule a meeting with FDA before you start the potentially pivotal Phase 2b trial? And then under which conditions do you think FDA would deem that trial pivotal? Secondly, maybe for Hank again. You are now assessing the proportionality in the Phase 3 trial for vosoritide but how important is that end point in the regulatory's eyes when you apply for approval pending the positive Phase 3 trial? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. How important is I guess... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (57:38) and the risk and the regulatory landscape (57:41). Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So I mentioned that we've had completed one round of interactions between EMA and the FDA. So hopefully that answers have we met with the FDA. And as to the path between now and the initiation of the Phase 2b study or the next study, and further FDA interactions, I probably won't give more specific comments about that until we're closer to the initiation of the clinical trial. Your question about what would be the basis for approval? I think it was, of the next trial that we do and as I laid out, that could be – if that trial is a factoring endpoint, it could lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in Europe. If that end point ends up being bleeding rate, that could lead to a full approval in both territories and exactly what mix and what approach we take, we're still in the process of harmonizing the feedback that we've obtained from the different regions. So a fairly normal phase or the process of pivoting from proof-of-concept into registration-enabling trials where we want to get the heaven of the best possible data to support adoption and reimbursement and the fastest regulatory action, so we can get started selling the product to patients. Now, switching the gears and talking about proportionality. The importance of proportionality, I think, is that it's something that defines achondroplasia different than growth hormone deficiency and represents an additional source of morbidity. It is less clearly understood than growth velocity as an outcome variable in statural disorders than proportionality is, but it could be relevant to substantiate that there is benefit for treatment beyond just growing faster. It could be that improving growth improves proportionality, improving growth and proportionality improves functional outcomes. And therefore that could be part of the story of how vosoritide gets approved at the end of the day. Now we're still collecting and doing trials and collecting data, so it's premature to speculate on what the outcomes of those trials will be, what significant regulatory review of those trial results is going to be taken for all of that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Martin Auster from UBS. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the BMN 270 manufacturing discussion that was laid out a little bit earlier. You spoke of a roughly nine-month timeframe between product production in Q3 of 2017 until Q2 2018 when the product from the new manufacturing facility could be introduced into the study. I just wanted to confirm that you intend to use the commercial produced product into the registration study? And also kind of, if you can comment on kind of your confidence level around that roughly nine-month timeframe and any key gating steps in that process? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. I'll start and then again, Hank and Robert can provide their perspective. It says on the big picture plan here when we said we anticipate starting the single trial (01:01:59) in Q3 at the time. And of course based on the timelines for the new facility, when we start that trial, we cannot use material from the new facility yet. So the plan in that case is to use material from a supplier that's used for the same process as the one we intend to use in the new facility but at a different scale, and it would be a larger scale in the new facility. Now, our intent is that to start sourcing, the product can be used in the field trial in the spring of next year from the new facility, and at the same time, anticipate to show comparability between the material provided from the current supplier and the new facility material. Should we be unable to show comparability between the two materials, then our current plan would be just to extend the field trials so as to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the new facility to still get approval with just patients treated from the new facility which will be the commercial scale and commercial process. Let's get out the big picture. Hank, do you want to add anything to that for Robert? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so one thing I would add – that's exactly the right description. You can think about what factors would cause an agency to be concerned about scale up and what factors would cause them to be unconcerned. So the better our comparability data, the less concerned they'll be and more willing they might be to accept the pooling of data from the two different sources. And then another aspect of consideration will be what's the relative benefit? And I think you can tell from the fact that we've received prime designation from the EMA, that there's a clearly clear recognition that the potential benefit of gene therapy is huge. So I think our view is, is that that's a reason to believe that we might be able to pool the results from studies of teams of the smaller scale same process with larger scale same process, but as J.J. laid out, stay tuned for how that action turns out. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on BMN 270. So Hank, I know you've had some preliminary regulatory discussions but I was just curious if you had any thoughts on there being any major differences and how the U.S. versus EU versus Japan, for example, the attitudes on risk benefit for BMN 270 and maybe some of the goal post that they would look for on the safety side, are there subtle differences that you'd expect or can you use the single trial across the globe to support approval? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, I think you just put your finger on the pulse of it. In the rare disease space, I think (1:04:38) has recognized the challenge of having region-specific trials. And part of the prime process is for them to be able to touch all the different corners of their process as early in the process as possible to facilitate that harmonization between the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Japan, we don't have as much experience with gene therapy just yet. So, my comments will be confined with the EMA and the FDA. My expectation is that the differences will be more subtle than they are major, but having this in the details and again you have to stay tuned to see how we're going to harmonize those various details. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Raju Prasad from William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. Hank, we've spoken to the few KOLs that showed a little bit concern on factor levels above 125%. Is that something that came up in regulatory discussions that you've had? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think the important thing to remember is just that we have a trial that allowed us to treat patients with that 5 x 1013 vg/kg dose that produced for one patient who's factor levels were above the upper limit normal. I'm not sure I know where the famous 125% or 120% (01:06:11). I mean that value is in the normal range. So I'm not sure where that concern emanated from. What we've said is that one out of our seven high-dose patients had stabilized around 250% and the remainder are below that upper limit of normal. So we've talked about what the ethno-immunologic evidence for how to evaluate the consequence that are and have characterized that as being fairly negligible. Having said that, we don't expect that every KOL is going to have the same opinion of the data on being number one and that it will take more and sample size longer-term follow-up to accumulate more data that will ultimately bring all prescribers into – or as many as possible into the viewfinder for prescribers as – prescribers of gene therapy. So we're pretty comfortable with the outcome of program so far from a health authority perspective. Stay tuned for more details about the program. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is in the context, if I may add, of where we stand now is – or the patients that have been treated with a high dose where we indeed had one patient that was above 150% which is upper limit (01:07:42). That's why we real puzzled by this 125% because as Hank said it is still within normal range, so we know where it comes from. Just in the context of patients that have not had any (01:07:54) or any need for recombinant Factor VIII infusion since July of last year. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then just a quick one, the manufacturing facility. Can you give some more color on the capacity days we have as far as – will you guys be able to produce other vectors aside from the ones you used for BMN 270? I just asked this because I think J.J. you've mentioned potentially disclosing another gene therapy candidate this year. Is that still the plan? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. As to next IND candidates, we tend not to talk about them until we talk about them and we haven't talk about them. We said, we recognized, we have a leadership position in gene therapy that might predispose us. And at the same time, there are other potentially very large orphans that could be of interest to BioMarin. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, we – seen another way, our gene therapies would probably be an important component of our future. At this time we don't really have any intention to turn into a pure gene therapy company. And we have internal research efforts and also business development efforts that also could potentially and likely will identify non-generic gene therapy solution to some rare and ultra-rare disorders that have no available therapy today. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks for the question. Operator And our next question comes from Jing He from Gabelli. Jing He - G.research LLC Thanks of taking the question. So on BMN 270, would you expect to have enough data from 4 x 1013 before starting Phase 2b. Should we expect an update on Q3? And also on Brineura, it's early days but just wondering if you've got any feedback from payers, especially on pricing. Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I'm just wondering, are we going to have some data I think that's what I heard on the 4 x 1013 addition before making a decision on the final design of the pivotal trial? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Of course. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, we will and we have an ongoing study of 4 x 1013. We have dosed 70 patients at 6 x 1013. As to whether that's sufficient or we need more dose finding, TBD. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And on your second question, the launch of Brineura just got under way, essentially this week. We've announced the price. We have some patients that are commercially in motion. We don't have any response yet from payers. Jing He - G.research LLC Great. Thanks. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for question. I will now turn the call back over to CEO and Chairman, J.J. Bienaimé for closing remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. So in summary, we start 2017 from a position of strength. We've been delivering a record quarter of $304 million in total BioMarin revenues. We've seen a 28% growth year-over-year. We got out sixth product approved, Brineura by the U.S. FDA. And it's in the process of being introduced probably at the beginning of June and potentially soon thereafter in Europe. Of course, upon a anticipated positive opinion there in June. Regarding our gene therapy program, it's moving forward and towards a registration-enabling study. Our pegvaliase is on the horizon and on track for a late Q2 filing. And continuing enrollments of our vosoritide and BMN 250 programs is (01:11:49). And so we look forward to continued success out of our worldwide development organizations. And we thank you for your continuous support and for joining us on today's call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask you about pegvaliase with the pending filing you have there. First of all, is it the same division of the FDA that just reviewed Brineura that's going to be looking at pegvaliase as well? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Cory. Yes, this is Hank. Same division, the Division of Gastrointestinal and Inborn Errors Products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, I mean at this stage of the game, I realized you're just kind of coming to focus a lot more in the coming months here, but what are your latest thoughts in terms of where you expect regulatory focus to be for this particular application? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. You're right. It's a little bit early to get into exactly where that's going to be. I think qualitatively, it's going to be in fairly similar places like it always is, safety, efficacy, overall benefit and risk. Now, the safety front has been well described. We've created a PEGylated enzyme that has a safety profile that's remarkably similar to our recombinant human products. Efficacy, we achieved Phe lowering in a very substantial portion of patients and only we'll be able to see an indirect evidence of a benefit on neurocognition. And I think the benefit risk concept has to be considered in the light of what's available alternative. And sadly, for so many patients in the PKU arena, there aren't very good alternatives. So medical food is unpalatable and unpleasant, has its own toxicities. And so, we hope that that will be the framework for evaluation during the review, but stay tuned for more considerations. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last thing, Hank, on this front, when you said you're looking to include, I think you said patient voice into the package. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you provide a little more color as to what that means? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, there are initiatives underway at Food and Drug Administration around patient-centered drug development and bringing patient's voice more in the process. You're familiar with us from the point of view of the open mic session at the Advisory Committees. You're also aware that the frequency of Advisory Committee is probably diminishing as time goes by and is less and less relevant in the rare and ultra-rare disease space. And so, we look for ways to, and so does the Agency, for ways to hear from patients in the development and regulatory process that helps make their interpretation of benefit risk most relevant to the patients, and to do that in a way that is more rich than simply the one hour in the Advisory Committee, which is diminishing in frequency. There are a variety of ways to do that. We have a lot of experience doing it, recently, gained a lot more experience doing that both in the U.S. and the EU with Brineura, and stay tuned for more specifics about that as the time draws closer. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, again, for taking the questions. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Question for Hank, on BMN 250, can you just run through the relationship again between heparan sulfate and neurocognition? And how you think about kind of the importance of some of the non-CNS disease burden going forward? And then just looking at the move from the 30 mg per week to the 300 mg dose, given the striking data that you saw at the lowest dose, what do you think the benefit is of moving to kind of a 10 times that high given that you're already seeing reductions in the biomark onto the normal range? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. So, heparan sulfate is one of the species of glycosaminoglycans that is not metabolized – tabolized, I should say, (24:39) correctly in the absence of this enzyme, NAGLU, and accumulates in brain cells. And its relationship to neurocognition impairments has really been best studied preclinically in the absence of clinical programs to document relationship between reductions in GAGs and improvements in neurocognitive outcomes. In animal species, what we have shown is that the direct delivery of the enzymes to the brain results in a reduction in measurable levels of heparan sulfate in brain tissues. And it's also accompanied by improvements in physiopathological evidence of neuronal cell health. And so, we think that the reduction by the delivery of the enzyme that's missing (25:36), the clearance of the storage product out of brain cells and the restoration of neural health will translate into resumption of normal cognitive development in MPS IIIB. As regards systemic or non-PNS or somatic manifestation of the disease, there is evidence of somatic impairment in MPS IIIB. Presently these morbidities are not as consequential for the patient as the CNS manifestations, and it's really the CNS manifestation that in today's world caused so much more morbidity. But one could imagine that if we have the same kind of effect on MPS IIIB that we have with that disease that there is the possibility that somatic manifestation for disease could become more pronounced. The modulator of that of course is just how much NAGLU gets into the periphery after an ICV delivery and MPS IIIB. And it's possible that some of the somatic manifestations may not develop, simply because there is some degree of enzyme delivered to the periphery. Stay tuned. It will take a while to learn more about that, and clearly, we'll learn more about that from the use of Brineura in CLN2 disease. And then finally, the rationale for going higher in dose on one level is the Phase 1 study to learn the tolerability of higher doses. And what we don't yet have evidence of about is the quantitative nature of the relationship between certain levels of GAG reductions and improvement in clinical outcomes. We'll be conducting some more preclinical experiments to better understand that. And as to what dose might be taking forward for commercialization, again, it's a little early to speculate about that so stay tuned. Hopefully (27:37). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Concise coverage (27:40). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No. No. That's great. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Next? Operator And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One commercial, then one pipeline. First, on the commercial, you did mention that there were some pull forward of the ordering patterns in Q1. Can you give us some sense of how that's likely to play out for the rest of the year? Is it all going to be felt in Q2 or is it more going to be spread over the subsequent quarters of the year? And then second, on pegvaliase, one for you, Hank. Could you remind us what prompted the FDA to require that the new immunology analysis, was it simply that a lot of time had passed since the trial or was there a more specific question that they informed you about? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Phil. Jeff here. I'll cover the first question. Wanted some evidence of forward buying, which is not unusual for these markets in Middle East, some markets in Asia, Latin America. Usually we don't see the impact of that all at once in the next quarter and we would quantify – as we've estimated that the impact on both Vimizim and Naglazyme to be a combined about $5 million to $10 million in the quarter. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good. Thanks. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And as to what prompted the Agency's request for additional analysis. It wasn't so much that it was driven by findings and discussions in the time before the BLA submission is driven more by the nature of the substance of the drug product. So to remind you PEG-PAL is phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a protein of non-human origin, which is pegylated to reduce the immunologic sequelae of developing an antibody response. The Agency, and it's earlier question we discussed, this is the same review division that is familiar with our Aldurazyme, our Naglazyme, our Vimizim. So, they are quite familiar with the immunologic responses to recombinant human products, but they are not quite as familiar with immunology, the response to a heavily pegylated bacterial product. So, we're talking about something somewhat new and recall also that some of our commentary about working with the DGIEP is that like other review division, they are stretched in for resources. So, knowing that the review time lines are going to be tight, it's really important for them to hit their PDUFA metrics. They have limited vehicles for extending submission reviews through major amendments. The agency requested that we provide as much of the immunology data upfront to facilitate their timely completion of their review. So, it was a negotiated agreement with the Agency about how much to give them in advance and how much to expect them to be undertaking as in process review. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Actually – okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding BMN 270, can you comment on steroid tapering or anything new need for steroid use and preliminary thoughts? Have you had any on the pivotal trial design? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, steroid, there is not really much of an update to give. I mean we'll cover this in a little bit more detail at ISTH. Just recall, the last update that we gave, I think the comment was everybody is off steroids, and everybody's liver function except for one patient, is down to normal and the one patient that wasn't already normal was at 45 with an upper limit of 43 or something like that. And so, there really is nothing new to report, and everybody is perking along and stay-tuned for a real update in the mid-year ISTH meeting. As regards the pivotal trial program, and I think there are sort of two poles of consideration. Clearly, one is, is that the potential for benefit is quite substantial in regard to reduction in bleeding episodes, reductions in Factor VIII use, improvement in quality of life related to reduced bleeding, reduced recombinant medications, potentially improved quality of life because of a reduction in bleeding frequency that is not treated as a bleed. For example, visceral bleeds are often not recognized as bleeds. So, there's quite a bit of desire to document that in a pivotal trial to support adoption and reimbursement. And we have every reason to believe given the data that we have obtained so far is that that's what will happen. At the same time, you've got an end point Factor VIII levels, which has got to be viewed as reasonably likely to predict a clinical outcome. And so that could offer an opportunity for an accelerated approval in the United States or conditional marketing authorization in Europe. And the virtue of that pathway is that it enables access to treatment faster than might otherwise be available if the product was approved under a standard approval mechanism. That's why they have accelerated conditional marketing authorizations in the U.S. and EU collectively. So, is it exactly what we settled on for the overall development program? TBD, but I think that's a little bit of color on how we're thinking about the opportunities there. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. And, Hank, just a follow-up here in MPS IIIB. When should we get the next update, and then any updated thoughts on patient epidemiology or the competitive landscape? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, on the competitive landscape front, pretty easy to say that the other folks are I think recognizing what we had recognized, which was direct brain delivery is probably a better idea than other approaches given the existence of a blood brain barrier and the need for relatively dramatic reductions. We are in the process of completing analysis of the patients in the dose escalation phase. We are busy enrolling more patients in the national history study, and ultimately, they'll flow into the treatment study. As to when the next update will be, I don't think we've penciled that out just yet, so stay tuned. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Another question on BMN 250, if you don't mind. So, Hank, I wonder if you could clarify – I know you said it's too early to talk about a final dose, but did you go directly from 30 milligrams to 300 milligrams or were there any interim steps in between? And then can you just clarify, is the expansion phase, they will all – the expansion phase – would that all be at the 300 milligram dose? And then finally on that, what's a reasonable timeframe to expect a neurocog result from that cohort? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So let's see, I'm going to do my best to remember the questions. So the patients were escalated from 30 milligram to 100 milligram to 300 milligram. So there was an intervening dose between 30 milligram and 300 milligram. And all of the patients in the expansion will start at 300 milligram together, the most information we can on the safety of high exposure and also the effects of higher doses on maintenance of GAG lowering. To remind you in the first three patients dosed at 30 milligrams, two out of three had heparan sulfate levels that moved into the normal range. And a third patient's CSF GAG levels moved into the normal arrangement to hover just above the normal range. So, we'd be very keen to see more data on longer term suppression of CSF GAG levels at the higher doses. Now, a timeframe on which to expect that update to be provided, I think again, is a little premature. Some of that has to do with the rate of enrollment in the natural history study. Some that has to do with the rate of transfer of patients from natural history into the drug study. So, it's really premature to speculate on when those data are available. I think also the nature of the question was when can we expect to see neurocog if there is a benefit. And the thing to say about that is that the primary outcome measure here is development. And if we see as good a result as we saw with Brineura, that might happen relatively quickly, but we don't know what magnitude of result we'll observe. So, that's also another complicating factor sort of estimating when there will be an update of relevance on NAGLU. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, that was actually my next question is, and maybe one that you're not ready to answer is, are there brackets around the magnitude that you'd need to see, at least in terms of what FDA is looking for or what you think you'd need in terms of neurocog benefit? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Well, what I can say is that we think that relatively low order magnitude reductions in CSF GAGs are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. And we based that on animal data that I referenced earlier in which you can't really impact neuronal cell health until you get to substantially more marked degrees of CSF GAG reduction. And we also partly based that on more intermediate impacts on CSF GAGs in MPS II and MPS IIIA, which were not accompanied by overt clinical benefits in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy delivered via lumbar intrathecal delivery. So, we think that you've got to push GAG levels down pretty far if not as far as you possibly can to achieve the dramatic effect that we like to see. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz from Leerink Partners. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us understand when we're likely to get the performance of the patients that are getting BMN 270 at the 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, as I said in my prepared comments, based on the observations that me and others have made, it takes about 14 to 26 weeks after gene transfer for liver expression to stabilize. And based on the timing of the doses that were given, we expect the data on 4 x 1013 vg/kg later this year. Now, I think what people are going to try to resolve to is what expectation to have for the ISTH update if the data are not there, what does it mean? It probably would only mean – and I'm saying this because we haven't arrived at any point of stabilization, because the presentation of data will be informed by whether it's officially mature yet as opposed to whether it's too early to make these data available. I would say and just remind people that with those patients, first three patients, we wait a little while before deciding whether to dose the next three patients with the same or higher dose. We dosed the next three patients at that same – what we're calling the mid-dose or 4 x 1013 vg/kg. And you can interpret that was because we're pretty enthusiastic about what we were seeing among the first three patients. As to exact numbers and exactly what's going to get presented and when it's going to get presented, we need to leave a little room for allowing the data to mature, and we're just not there. I know we're eight weeks ahead of the event, but we're just not at the event yet. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC All right. Okay. And then on vosoritide, it sounds like you were modifying the randomized study, if that's right and then adding some ancillary studies. Can you explain some more about what's going on there? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, it was really more around modified ancillary studies. The trial is in rolling now, one year placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial continuing substantially unmodified as we talked about it in the past. The ancillary studies are a program of studies that we've talked about in the past. We've talked about the functionality, proportionality, final adult height and safety efficacy in infants and toddlers. And as has been our tradition in the past, we usually concentrate on getting the randomized study up and running first, and then we turn our attention to the ancillary studies for the simple reason that the randomized trials usually provide about definitive evidence and the ancillary trials if they require it all for registration are supported at best. And so, the commentary was simply that as regard to final adult heights, we're building more contemporaneous database that relates final adult height in achondroplasia and relates final adult height in achondroplasia to functional outcomes related to proportionality of the functional outcomes. So just giving a little bit more specifics about the objectives of that portion of the program and then a little bit more specifics around the infant and toddler study by saying that it's very important in providing additional evidence of growth benefit as well as potentially neurological benefit of introducing vosoritide. And those modifications for that portion of the program were being undertaken. Now that we have so much more safety and efficacy data from doses in older children. So, again, the big picture is the vosoritide is progressing, randomized control trial underway, ancillary studies in support of decision making by payers by regulators and stay tuned for more updates as those studies get more completely finalized. Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC All right, great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two follow-ups and I think they're more just clarifications. Hank, on vosoritide, can you just talk a little bit about the younger kids studies that you're going to start. I mean is there any dosing work that you need to do there and sort of what's the age range of patients that you were considering and then – or if you don't need it to dose (43:19) physicians to start something where they're going to look at growth velocity. And then, if you could just clarify, because you said a couple of things about BMN 270 data at ISTH. We will see data from 4 x 1013 vg/kg (43:33) cohort and it's just unclear about the scope and size of that data or is it possible that we won't see any data from that cohort? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we'll take the last part first. It's possible you won't see any data from the cohort. It is also possible that you'll see some data from that cohort and it's just too early even recognizing that it's not that far away from now. Just you want to let the data mature and we don't want to present something potentially misleading as it is maturing. So stay tuned and then we'll do our very best to get you relevant information just as soon as we have it. And then on BMN 111, I don't know that I can be more concretely definite than just as to your questions, we're excited to say more specific. We're evaluating the data that we have on exposure and age to determine if its substantially likely that we would need to have different doses in much younger children. And the age range that we would be considering is – in a randomized trial, you're eligible if you're older than five. But we recognized (44:45) diagnosed, oftentimes either before birth or at birth or shortly after birth, and that families will want to know, is it safe to start vosoritide or when is it safe start vosoritide. Especially given that the earlier you treat a genetic disease, the better your long-term outcome is. So we're scrubbing our safety exposure response data from our existing population. We're endeavoring to push, in partnership with health authorities and our clinician advisers to progressively younger and younger children to establish safety and potentially efficacy. And until that trial is up on clinicaltrials.gov, I think it would be too preliminary to speculate on the exact final clinical (45:34) study. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Just maybe a follow-up or two. On BMN 270, it seems like you and one of your gene therapy competitors might have data in Berlin. Hank, maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on as we all try to compare across trials, what we should be looking for? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The non-cheeky answer to that is going to be – well, it's going to sound cheeky no matter how I deliver it. It's going to be the fact – it's how much experience in time do the various assets have under their belt. When we first – I think the picture that we have of BMN 270 now at the year-plus mark is substantially different than where it was at say the half-year mark. I mean just to remind you at R&D Day last year, I think we were presenting that we had gotten an effective gene transfer to some patients, but we're also in the middle of dealing with some liver function test elevations and some regulatory interactions around those liver functions test elevations. And as you flash forward, you realize that all that had settled out and hardly any of that was relevant. So I think, with us positioned so far out in front of the competition, it's going to be a little hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons to seize the time differences the two programs have. I think the second thing is to just remind that, yeah, it can be very difficult in the best of circumstances can compare drugs that were not studied in the same study. And so I suspect that the followers will be talking about how great their evidence is that stacked up against our data. And I would just caution that that's hard to do in even the best of circumstances. Our focus will be on getting our BMN 270 across the finish line and that's what you're going to hear from us. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up question in regard to the potential pivotal design for BMN 270, I know you've mentioned annualized bleeding rates. You mentioned Factor VIII levels. Is it possible for you to just maybe opine on the size of those studies and potential duration of a follow-up that the FDA might require? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can opine on practically anything. So I think you see the stabilization in Factor VIII levels, 14 to 26 weeks, the question I think the health authorities will ask is, is that long enough to be sure that levels aren't going to go dramatically up after that period or dramatically down after that period, but I think you can get a sense of a dramatic effect on Factor VIII expressions in half a year. On bleeding, there have been clinical trials that have led to approvals of products with the half a year of data. My suspicion is that in gene therapy on an important clinical outcome like bleeding, health authorities are going to want to see more than half a year of data on bleeding rate. I think the bigger difference between the two pathways is likely to be sample size. When you can correct the gene expression from less than 1% to in the normal range, it's not going to take a lot of patient sample to document that. If that's going to take a lot of sample sizes to document an 91% reduction in bleeding frequency either although that number could end up being a little bit bigger than the Factor VIII number simply because of the trial design considerations. So stay tuned. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And one question for J.J., if I may. What are the plans for the pediatric review voucher? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We haven't really decided at this time. A lot of the products we have in development actually would themselves be getting priority review. You don't know this time is pegvaliase will get priority review. So it will be in the equation but that's not the only thing. So, we might look at divesting this voucher, but again, we haven't made any final decision. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with the first one back to PEG-PAL and kind of anymore consensus about measuring neurocog or anything maybe on the more quantitative side that you can include in the package? And then I have a couple others. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Alethia. I think we've came to the pretty comprehensive story already about what we know about neurocognition which to just remind you is that there is pretty heterogeneous phenotype of cognitive impairment in PKU patients. The predominant form of impairment is inattentiveness, but there are also other neurocognitive manifestations. Some of those include mood disorders like anxiety and depression, but some of those also include dimensions of neurological health like executive function, judgment ability, et cetera. We concentrated on the inattentiveness in the previously conducted pivotal trial for the simple reason that was the most prevalent of the forms. We documented that the neurocognitive impairment in phenylketonuria in adults is not irreversible, but for reasons we don't completely understand, we were unable to document improvement in neurocognitive outcome in patients randomized to withdraw from pegvaliase compared to patients who were maintained on the pegvaliase after achieving a steady pegvaliase dose. That may pertain to the tools and that may pertain to the timeframe. So, we also demonstrated some trends in some of the more quantitative aspects of executive function, specifically computer sets, the tests of processing speed, as an example. We referred to that as CANTAB in our previous communication. And we're working with experts and agency to identify what could be used in a post-approval trial should that be warranted. And I want to remind you from my prepared comments that no definitive path has been determined for the application or for the approval. We are working in parallel with the agency anticipating and wanting to be ready for whatever post-approval commitments come our way. And so we're examining these issues very carefully and closely right now. We haven't settled on exactly what to do next in regard to measuring neurocog in PKU patients. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. And so on the gene therapy manufacturing facility, I know you talked about mid-year as kind of timeline. Is there anything else that kind of needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just kind of walk us through the what's next briefly at a time and last steps. And then the last question is probably for Jeff, around – can you talk about potential impact of Kuvan, of generics? Do you think it's like kind of a slope, or do you think it's a cliff and why do you think that thing? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So let's start with manufacturing. We got Robert Baffi, our Head of Technical Operations here on the line. So Robert, you want to answer that question on gene therapy manufacturing? Robert A. Baffi - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Sure J.J. Thank you. So where we are now with the facility is we've mechanically completed the facilities, that means all the major pieces of equipment have been installed. We go through a commissioning phase which will take approximately two to three months to make sure all equipment is appropriately validated and operational. And then we'll go into production starting in the late part of the third quarter, and eventually, as we produce and characterize that material, we will have to file that facility as with the Agency and that's the main reasons why the timing for bill of material goes into the second quarter of 2018. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Robert. Now Jeff to answer the question on generics? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So Alethia, I think you're referring to what would our expectations be in the U.S. market to... Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That's right. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ... the generic entry. And I think that we know very well how to characterize the generic entry for a traditional retail type of pharmaceutical. It's less clear what to expect in the case of Kuvan, because of our unique business model, and because there's not really very many, if any, good analogs to follow of specialty products with closed-loop distribution systems facing generic entry. So anything we have to offer on this one is speculation, but some of the things that we're thinking about are the traditional methods by which generics get rapid penetration and displace the reference brand may not apply here. We may have some advantages favoring Kuvan, based not only on the distribution model, but our relationship with prescribers and patients. And also, we are not underestimating the ability of a generic competitor to find cracks in the model. So, can't provide very specific guidance to you other than saying we don't think it's going to be exactly a traditional cliff like with a standard retail pharmaceutical. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. I also want to add that. I mean, of course, it was going to be depend whether or not pegvaliase (56:27) October 2020 in the U.S. and the extent to which some Kuvan adult patients moved to pegvaliase in the U.S. And also, I just want to remind you that the October 2020 date is only I guess the U.S. market. And for Europe, we think we have market protection until 2024. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ying Huang from BoA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for BMN 270 regulatory path here. Can you clarify whether you have had a meeting or you will schedule a meeting with FDA before you start the potentially pivotal Phase 2b trial? And then under which conditions do you think FDA would deem that trial pivotal? Secondly, maybe for Hank again. You are now assessing the proportionality in the Phase 3 trial for vosoritide but how important is that end point in the regulatory's eyes when you apply for approval pending the positive Phase 3 trial? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. How important is I guess... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (57:38) and the risk and the regulatory landscape (57:41). Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So I mentioned that we've had completed one round of interactions between EMA and the FDA. So hopefully that answers have we met with the FDA. And as to the path between now and the initiation of the Phase 2b study or the next study, and further FDA interactions, I probably won't give more specific comments about that until we're closer to the initiation of the clinical trial. Your question about what would be the basis for approval? I think it was, of the next trial that we do and as I laid out, that could be – if that trial is a factoring endpoint, it could lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in Europe. If that end point ends up being bleeding rate, that could lead to a full approval in both territories and exactly what mix and what approach we take, we're still in the process of harmonizing the feedback that we've obtained from the different regions. So a fairly normal phase or the process of pivoting from proof-of-concept into registration-enabling trials where we want to get the heaven of the best possible data to support adoption and reimbursement and the fastest regulatory action, so we can get started selling the product to patients. Now, switching the gears and talking about proportionality. The importance of proportionality, I think, is that it's something that defines achondroplasia different than growth hormone deficiency and represents an additional source of morbidity. It is less clearly understood than growth velocity as an outcome variable in statural disorders than proportionality is, but it could be relevant to substantiate that there is benefit for treatment beyond just growing faster. It could be that improving growth improves proportionality, improving growth and proportionality improves functional outcomes. And therefore that could be part of the story of how vosoritide gets approved at the end of the day. Now we're still collecting and doing trials and collecting data, so it's premature to speculate on what the outcomes of those trials will be, what significant regulatory review of those trial results is going to be taken for all of that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Martin Auster from UBS. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the BMN 270 manufacturing discussion that was laid out a little bit earlier. You spoke of a roughly nine-month timeframe between product production in Q3 of 2017 until Q2 2018 when the product from the new manufacturing facility could be introduced into the study. I just wanted to confirm that you intend to use the commercial produced product into the registration study? And also kind of, if you can comment on kind of your confidence level around that roughly nine-month timeframe and any key gating steps in that process? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. I'll start and then again, Hank and Robert can provide their perspective. It says on the big picture plan here when we said we anticipate starting the single trial (01:01:59) in Q3 at the time. And of course based on the timelines for the new facility, when we start that trial, we cannot use material from the new facility yet. So the plan in that case is to use material from a supplier that's used for the same process as the one we intend to use in the new facility but at a different scale, and it would be a larger scale in the new facility. Now, our intent is that to start sourcing, the product can be used in the field trial in the spring of next year from the new facility, and at the same time, anticipate to show comparability between the material provided from the current supplier and the new facility material. Should we be unable to show comparability between the two materials, then our current plan would be just to extend the field trials so as to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the new facility to still get approval with just patients treated from the new facility which will be the commercial scale and commercial process. Let's get out the big picture. Hank, do you want to add anything to that for Robert? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so one thing I would add – that's exactly the right description. You can think about what factors would cause an agency to be concerned about scale up and what factors would cause them to be unconcerned. So the better our comparability data, the less concerned they'll be and more willing they might be to accept the pooling of data from the two different sources. And then another aspect of consideration will be what's the relative benefit? And I think you can tell from the fact that we've received prime designation from the EMA, that there's a clearly clear recognition that the potential benefit of gene therapy is huge. So I think our view is, is that that's a reason to believe that we might be able to pool the results from studies of teams of the smaller scale same process with larger scale same process, but as J.J. laid out, stay tuned for how that action turns out. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on BMN 270. So Hank, I know you've had some preliminary regulatory discussions but I was just curious if you had any thoughts on there being any major differences and how the U.S. versus EU versus Japan, for example, the attitudes on risk benefit for BMN 270 and maybe some of the goal post that they would look for on the safety side, are there subtle differences that you'd expect or can you use the single trial across the globe to support approval? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, I think you just put your finger on the pulse of it. In the rare disease space, I think (1:04:38) has recognized the challenge of having region-specific trials. And part of the prime process is for them to be able to touch all the different corners of their process as early in the process as possible to facilitate that harmonization between the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Japan, we don't have as much experience with gene therapy just yet. So, my comments will be confined with the EMA and the FDA. My expectation is that the differences will be more subtle than they are major, but having this in the details and again you have to stay tuned to see how we're going to harmonize those various details. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Raju Prasad from William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. Hank, we've spoken to the few KOLs that showed a little bit concern on factor levels above 125%. Is that something that came up in regulatory discussions that you've had? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think the important thing to remember is just that we have a trial that allowed us to treat patients with that 5 x 1013 vg/kg dose that produced for one patient who's factor levels were above the upper limit normal. I'm not sure I know where the famous 125% or 120% (01:06:11). I mean that value is in the normal range. So I'm not sure where that concern emanated from. What we've said is that one out of our seven high-dose patients had stabilized around 250% and the remainder are below that upper limit of normal. So we've talked about what the ethno-immunologic evidence for how to evaluate the consequence that are and have characterized that as being fairly negligible. Having said that, we don't expect that every KOL is going to have the same opinion of the data on being number one and that it will take more and sample size longer-term follow-up to accumulate more data that will ultimately bring all prescribers into – or as many as possible into the viewfinder for prescribers as – prescribers of gene therapy. So we're pretty comfortable with the outcome of program so far from a health authority perspective. Stay tuned for more details about the program. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is in the context, if I may add, of where we stand now is – or the patients that have been treated with a high dose where we indeed had one patient that was above 150% which is upper limit (01:07:42). That's why we real puzzled by this 125% because as Hank said it is still within normal range, so we know where it comes from. Just in the context of patients that have not had any (01:07:54) or any need for recombinant Factor VIII infusion since July of last year. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then just a quick one, the manufacturing facility. Can you give some more color on the capacity days we have as far as – will you guys be able to produce other vectors aside from the ones you used for BMN 270? I just asked this because I think J.J. you've mentioned potentially disclosing another gene therapy candidate this year. Is that still the plan? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. As to next IND candidates, we tend not to talk about them until we talk about them and we haven't talk about them. We said, we recognized, we have a leadership position in gene therapy that might predispose us. And at the same time, there are other potentially very large orphans that could be of interest to BioMarin. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, we – seen another way, our gene therapies would probably be an important component of our future. At this time we don't really have any intention to turn into a pure gene therapy company. And we have internal research efforts and also business development efforts that also could potentially and likely will identify non-generic gene therapy solution to some rare and ultra-rare disorders that have no available therapy today. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks for the question. Operator And our next question comes from Jing He from Gabelli. Jing He - G.research LLC Thanks of taking the question. So on BMN 270, would you expect to have enough data from 4 x 1013 before starting Phase 2b. Should we expect an update on Q3? And also on Brineura, it's early days but just wondering if you've got any feedback from payers, especially on pricing. Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I'm just wondering, are we going to have some data I think that's what I heard on the 4 x 1013 addition before making a decision on the final design of the pivotal trial? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Of course. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, we will and we have an ongoing study of 4 x 1013. We have dosed 70 patients at 6 x 1013. As to whether that's sufficient or we need more dose finding, TBD. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And on your second question, the launch of Brineura just got under way, essentially this week. We've announced the price. We have some patients that are commercially in motion. We don't have any response yet from payers. Jing He - G.research LLC Great. Thanks. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for question. I will now turn the call back over to CEO and Chairman, J.J. Bienaimé for closing remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. So in summary, we start 2017 from a position of strength. We've been delivering a record quarter of $304 million in total BioMarin revenues. We've seen a 28% growth year-over-year. We got out sixth product approved, Brineura by the U.S. FDA. And it's in the process of being introduced probably at the beginning of June and potentially soon thereafter in Europe. Of course, upon a anticipated positive opinion there in June. Regarding our gene therapy program, it's moving forward and towards a registration-enabling study. Our pegvaliase is on the horizon and on track for a late Q2 filing. And continuing enrollments of our vosoritide and BMN 250 programs is (01:11:49). And so we look forward to continued success out of our worldwide development organizations. And we thank you for your continuous support and for joining us on today's call.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Gregoire Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we’ve seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio, with exceptionally strong results in our test data management business. In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD, as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI. Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. Results from our North America Platinum and Public Sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, inline with our longer term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth, or partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well. And, we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products and most importantly the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the mid-point of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came inline and reflects the absorption of acquisition related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with zero defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative, and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad, solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail, corporate systems, credit cards and dotcom property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base, and reduce their cost. In conjunction with our partners and our customers’ IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to seven key CA solutions in less than 90 days. Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems, commonly referred to as zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security rich mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed costs of running a mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great businesses and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter’s performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years. I’m also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we’re seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers’ willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is at the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Companywide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 in the prior year. Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4 CA was named a Leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We’re working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and Blazemeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell, and monetize our subscription based products more systematically, with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building out a common set of best practices, metrics, and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go to market. As mentioned last quarter, we’ve observed that our largest Named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we’ve made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards two sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum, in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go to market strategy for CA over time. This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly and so are we. We’ve made incredible progress and as we look toward the next phase of this company’s evolution, in many ways we are just getting started. As we enter FY'18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you. Kieran McGrath Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I’m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we have stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis, due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence. Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid 40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the four quarters. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results include one quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisition of Automic. Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1%, and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported, and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we’ve said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. Enterprise solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, were also adversely impacted by non-recurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margin was impacted by increased level of commission expense commensurate with new sales growth. Services margin was negative 3%. As we’ve discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of this structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions, and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by the GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter, to settle a longstanding matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year-ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. Separately, we issued $850 million in investment grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a five-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near-term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31st, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we’ve said in the past. We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported, and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering, mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting. The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities, rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first two quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back-end loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we are also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4 where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we’ll open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow Two if I may. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about when you see a new sales perform better than renewals. That’s my first and I have one quick follow up then. Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, thank you, Raimo. Actually for FY '17, if you exclude the mainframe capacity, new sales growth exceeded the growth in the renewal portfolio. And given our improved product portfolio, we believe new sales should be significantly better than the renewal portfolio this year in FY '18. I think that statement should be true on an organic basis as well. Raimo Lenschow Okay. Perfect. Really that sounds like you have turned a corner. And can I talk about the -- you mentioned the changes in the sales organization. I mean it's like enterprise commercial kind of seems to make a lot of sense. How much disruption should we get? Should we kind of expect from that or is it kind of all done and can you talk through that a little bit? Michael Gregoire Yes. I expect no disruption in it. The people who are covering accounts are covering the same accounts. We have moved some of the smaller accounts what we call commercial. And this has been something we have been working at for a couple of years as we have tried to improve the commercial segment. We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they could service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know we have been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solution. Try and buy, lend and extend. Those solutions lend themselves well in those sales. And then strategically, as we know that our enterprise portfolio will relatively midterm, exceed the mainframe portfolio, we have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expense sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force, is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg Automic did a lot better than I think you guys had thought. I am curious, Mike, what drove that outperformance. Was it conservative assumptions or was it just a lot of broad net new sales that you saw in the quarter. Michael Gregoire Yes. I think it's a couple of things. First, a lot of net new [raw] [ph] sales couple with the fact it was their year-end, so their sales professionals have been working on deals and that all came together at the end of their quarter. And the secondly, customers that were evaluating multiple providers, the strength of the CA brand and ability to service customers on a global basis as well as the ability to link other products into their portfolio, gave then a strategic view into what the future could look like as they try to automate their whole infrastructure. So I think it was a combination of those three things that gave a little bit of up performance but I definitely want to hand off a lot of congratulations to the Automic team. They really went after the quarter with a lot of gusto. Matt Hedberg That’s helpful. Thank you. And then Kieran, I am curious on 606. It sounds like we will see more tomorrow. I am curious though, can you provide a little bit more color on potentially the impact to reported revenue. I guess the license component. Anything you can kind of help us out with a little bit more color on that. Kieran McGrath I think, Matt, it's a little premature on that for me to start giving specifics on it. But as you can well expect, we are a business that has been very primarily ratable, very small amount of upfront revenue, you can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the license content which is obviously quite material in both the ES and mainframe business. We will add volatility in any one given quarter. We think it's more than [indiscernible] over time. The length of time, maybe somewhat debatable but I think that’s what we are in the process of really sizing here. And what we are looking at -- are really looking for metrics that we will be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity in the business as we move through time. That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don’t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don’t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don’t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that’s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers? Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, first, we didn’t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together. We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well? Kieran McGrath Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that’s pretty clear evidence that we really didn’t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that’s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point. Michael Gregoire Is that helpful, John? John DiFucci Yes. That’s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy. Michael Gregoire Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that’s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half. Michael Gregoire Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question. Kieran McGrath Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that’s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits Two questions regarding acquisition. One, Mike, obviously this has been a very aggressive couple of years in terms of the dollar amount and [indiscernible]. 12 of the 300 million to 500 million bogie. So maybe if you could tell me how you are feeling at this point in terms of the -- next couple of years. Michael Gregoire Sure. Michael, you are breaking up a little bit. I think you are just saying how are we feeling now? Kieran McGrath I think you were asking about acquisitions, Michael. Michael Turits Yes. Sorry, headset malfunction there. Yes, acquisition were above, obviously $1.5 billion to $2 billion in last couple of years, above the $300 million to $500 million bogie, thoughts on the pace going forward? Michael Gregoire Sure. If I had my way in the world, what I would love to do is digest these acquisitions that we made. We are very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I have always preferred, given my choice to do smaller acquisitions, in the $50 million to $80 million range, that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products the scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engines. Unfortunately, we don’t get to chose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example. That was a two year quoting period and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode which we have been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in a relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity at properties like that, it's a price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don’t feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we would like the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I would like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in. Michael Turits Okay. And then you guys gave lots of help to us in terms of doing organic calculations. So really appreciate that. Just one, I don’t think you necessarily gave on the current revenue backlog which I believe is up 6% constant currency. Was that roughly five points from acquisition, because obviously that’s being going positive, something we are trying to closely monitor? Michael Gregoire Yes. So of the six points of constant currency, about half of it, three points was related to Veracode which as you know we closed on the absolute last day of the quarter and then Automic. And then the other portion, the other half was related to just the timing of the renewal portfolio that comes due here in fiscal '18, as well as the Q4 new sales. Michael Turits So you are saying it's three points only from acquisitions that’s inorganic in that’s six points. Michael Gregoire That’s correct. Michael Turits Okay. Thanks. I guess, if I squeeze one in. So does that feel though, I mean you said there is some timing. I mean this has been a big deal to talk about, one you felt like that was turning up in a sustainable way. So are those timing issues suggesting that that is not the turn or you think it might be? Michael Gregoire You know I like to hit it straight down the middle with you guys. When the number was flat or slightly negative, I kept reminding you that as the renewal portfolio, there was a lot up for renewal in fiscal '17, that that would influence, in a negative way, the current backlog and similarly as we have a lot of activity stretching out over time, it kind of goes the other way. All that said, I am very happy where we ended the quarter from a position perspective on the revenue backlog. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield on for Kirk. Two quick questions. Mike, can you provide just a bit more color on the improvement in sales execution this quarter and just kind of why you believe that can continue into FY '18? And then Kieran, can you just remind us of the assumed impact from Automic and Veracode on revenue guidance for FY '18? And are you going to call out the contribution from these deals individually going forward or just the total impact on revenue and profitability? Thanks. Michael Gregoire Well, with respect to sales execution, I think it comes down to having great products in a business model that sales professionals understand and a marketing team that has done a much much better job being able to articulate not only the strategy of our company and each one of our segments, but how the products work as a single product focus, as well as how those products work together. So when we are talking to customers, they might only want to buy one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous delivery, for example. You can buy just one product in continuous delivery but if you think about how you are going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovations and get up to market quickly, you can see as you are own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost, will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company. So we kind of call this whole package together. The software factory and as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company and we kind of fit the mould really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that’s really helping tell, a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the backlog question. Kieran McGrath Yes. So we are to report the acquisitions in total, as we always do. You will be give a clear view of what the acquisitive versus organic contribution is on both the new sales and a revenue perspective. Right now, we are giving guidance for three to four points for the year. We think the acquisitions are going to be roughly worth about 4 points. The reason I am hedging a little bit is I only closed Veracode on the 31 st . We have to do the valuation work and the whole of new impairment. While that work has to be done as we go through time, but we clearly call out the acquisitive nature in aggregate for both of those. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Abhey Lamba Good execution there. So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens. So are we modeling the new sales to grow on an organic basis in fiscal '18? Michael Gregoire Yes. I think when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sales then we had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand and coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of a new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single product companies, as we are starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product or solve one problem, they are trying to orchestrate a digital re-mastering of their business. And in order to do that, you are going to need multiple products, very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we are going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently. Kieran, maybe you would like to add to that based on some of the numbers you have been monitoring. Kieran McGrath So I guess, first of all, as you are probably aware, we don’t normally usually guide on new sales as we go forward. However, as Mike has been describing, we think about organic performance, ES revenue actually grew organically in fiscal '17 by two points. The mainframe was down a point. So overall our product revenue was actually flat in '17 with mainframe down a point, and ES up two points. So we look forward to time here. Obviously, we expect the mainframe market is declining in the low single digits to continue our planning at that level of planning, but we would expect to move to a time here that ES will continue to exhibit organic growth. Abhey Lamba Got it. Thanks, Kieran. Absolutely, that's very helpful. Thanks for the additional color. Kieran, you talked about the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption. Can you quantify the impact on your cash flows in your guidance? Thanks. Kieran McGrath No. Because we are going to actually doing it retrospectively, there will be no changes in the year to year. It's a relatively small amount to begin with but we are going to restate '17 and '18, so there won't be any impact on year to year. Abhey Lamba So what will your fiscal '17 cash flow be in that accounting method? Kieran McGrath Honestly, I don’t have it in front of me here right now. It's about $30 million. Yes. So my guys are telling me here, it's about $30 million. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard So I guess two questions. One similar to what Michael asked you on the revenue backlog. I think the billings backlog may have benefitted as well from the acquisition. Could you quantify what the impact was there from, I guess, Veracode and Automic. Kieran McGrath Right. So from an organic perspective, on the constant currency perspective in total, we are up 9%. The acquisitions contributed about two points to that 9%. Walter Pritchard And what about on the short-term? Kieran McGrath I am sorry, that was the short term number I was saying. The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions. Walter Pritchard Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there. Michael Gregoire Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected. Walter Pritchard Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx. Kieran McGrath So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that’s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run. Operator Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Michael Gregoire Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow Two if I may. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about when you see a new sales perform better than renewals. That’s my first and I have one quick follow up then. Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, thank you, Raimo. Actually for FY '17, if you exclude the mainframe capacity, new sales growth exceeded the growth in the renewal portfolio. And given our improved product portfolio, we believe new sales should be significantly better than the renewal portfolio this year in FY '18. I think that statement should be true on an organic basis as well. Raimo Lenschow Okay. Perfect. Really that sounds like you have turned a corner. And can I talk about the -- you mentioned the changes in the sales organization. I mean it's like enterprise commercial kind of seems to make a lot of sense. How much disruption should we get? Should we kind of expect from that or is it kind of all done and can you talk through that a little bit? Michael Gregoire Yes. I expect no disruption in it. The people who are covering accounts are covering the same accounts. We have moved some of the smaller accounts what we call commercial. And this has been something we have been working at for a couple of years as we have tried to improve the commercial segment. We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they could service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know we have been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solution. Try and buy, lend and extend. Those solutions lend themselves well in those sales. And then strategically, as we know that our enterprise portfolio will relatively midterm, exceed the mainframe portfolio, we have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expense sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force, is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg Automic did a lot better than I think you guys had thought. I am curious, Mike, what drove that outperformance. Was it conservative assumptions or was it just a lot of broad net new sales that you saw in the quarter. Michael Gregoire Yes. I think it's a couple of things. First, a lot of net new [raw] [ph] sales couple with the fact it was their year-end, so their sales professionals have been working on deals and that all came together at the end of their quarter. And the secondly, customers that were evaluating multiple providers, the strength of the CA brand and ability to service customers on a global basis as well as the ability to link other products into their portfolio, gave then a strategic view into what the future could look like as they try to automate their whole infrastructure. So I think it was a combination of those three things that gave a little bit of up performance but I definitely want to hand off a lot of congratulations to the Automic team. They really went after the quarter with a lot of gusto. Matt Hedberg That’s helpful. Thank you. And then Kieran, I am curious on 606. It sounds like we will see more tomorrow. I am curious though, can you provide a little bit more color on potentially the impact to reported revenue. I guess the license component. Anything you can kind of help us out with a little bit more color on that. Kieran McGrath I think, Matt, it's a little premature on that for me to start giving specifics on it. But as you can well expect, we are a business that has been very primarily ratable, very small amount of upfront revenue, you can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the license content which is obviously quite material in both the ES and mainframe business. We will add volatility in any one given quarter. We think it's more than [indiscernible] over time. The length of time, maybe somewhat debatable but I think that’s what we are in the process of really sizing here. And what we are looking at -- are really looking for metrics that we will be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity in the business as we move through time. That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don’t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don’t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don’t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that’s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers? Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, first, we didn’t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together. We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well? Kieran McGrath Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that’s pretty clear evidence that we really didn’t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that’s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point. Michael Gregoire Is that helpful, John? John DiFucci Yes. That’s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy. Michael Gregoire Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that’s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half. Michael Gregoire Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question. Kieran McGrath Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that’s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens. Operator Thank you.

The software factory and as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company and we kind of fit the mould really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that’s really helping tell, a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the backlog question. Kieran McGrath Yes. So we are to report the acquisitions in total, as we always do. You will be give a clear view of what the acquisitive versus organic contribution is on both the new sales and a revenue perspective. Right now, we are giving guidance for three to four points for the year. We think the acquisitions are going to be roughly worth about 4 points. The reason I am hedging a little bit is I only closed Veracode on the 31 st . We have to do the valuation work and the whole of new impairment. While that work has to be done as we go through time, but we clearly call out the acquisitive nature in aggregate for both of those. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Abhey Lamba Good execution there. So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens. So are we modeling the new sales to grow on an organic basis in fiscal '18? Michael Gregoire Yes. I think when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sales then we had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand and coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of a new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single product companies, as we are starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product or solve one problem, they are trying to orchestrate a digital re-mastering of their business. And in order to do that, you are going to need multiple products, very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we are going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently. Kieran, maybe you would like to add to that based on some of the numbers you have been monitoring. Kieran McGrath So I guess, first of all, as you are probably aware, we don’t normally usually guide on new sales as we go forward. However, as Mike has been describing, we think about organic performance, ES revenue actually grew organically in fiscal '17 by two points. The mainframe was down a point. So overall our product revenue was actually flat in '17 with mainframe down a point, and ES up two points. So we look forward to time here. Obviously, we expect the mainframe market is declining in the low single digits to continue our planning at that level of planning, but we would expect to move to a time here that ES will continue to exhibit organic growth. Abhey Lamba Got it. Thanks, Kieran. Absolutely, that's very helpful. Thanks for the additional color. Kieran, you talked about the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption. Can you quantify the impact on your cash flows in your guidance? Thanks. Kieran McGrath No. Because we are going to actually doing it retrospectively, there will be no changes in the year to year. It's a relatively small amount to begin with but we are going to restate '17 and '18, so there won't be any impact on year to year. Abhey Lamba So what will your fiscal '17 cash flow be in that accounting method? Kieran McGrath Honestly, I don’t have it in front of me here right now. It's about $30 million. Yes. So my guys are telling me here, it's about $30 million. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard So I guess two questions. One similar to what Michael asked you on the revenue backlog. I think the billings backlog may have benefitted as well from the acquisition. Could you quantify what the impact was there from, I guess, Veracode and Automic. Kieran McGrath Right. So from an organic perspective, on the constant currency perspective in total, we are up 9%. The acquisitions contributed about two points to that 9%. Walter Pritchard And what about on the short-term? Kieran McGrath I am sorry, that was the short term number I was saying. The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions. Walter Pritchard Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there. Michael Gregoire Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected. Walter Pritchard Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx. Kieran McGrath So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that’s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run. Operator Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Michael Gregoire Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond. Thank you, very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Good afternoon everyone. My name is Carter Gould, I am the Senior Large Cap Biotech Analyst here at UBS and welcome to Day two. Next up is Celgene. Joining me on stage is Michael Pehl, President of Global Hematology and Oncology; and Terrie Curran, President of I&I. So, welcome, thank you both for joining us on stage. I believe, to kick-off, Michael is going to make some comments to set the stage. Why [Indiscernible] and we can kind of -- [Indiscernible] the conversation. Michael Pehl Thank you and thanks for inviting us. It's really great to be here. Before we start with the questions, I just wanted to say that I -- we believe Celgene is an incredibly important and exciting time. We have a fantastic business momentum that is dedicated true for both I&I and for Hematology/Oncology with our existing products. We've been achieving a lot to of clinical and regulatory milestones recently and I hope will have a chance to talk about those a little bit. And then we have this period in the next 18 to 24 months where 18, 19 Phase III studies are going to read out across both franchises, I&I and Hematology/Oncology. And at the same time, I think our mid and late-stage pipelines just gets much more visibility. So, in Hematology/Oncology alone, we're going to have more than 10 pivotal decisions upon new assets that are going to help fuel the growth beyond 2020 and I think there's a similarly rich period coming for I&I. So, there's a lot of momentum ongoing, a lot of exciting data read outs and a great pipeline, and we're all very positive and optimistic and excited at Celgene. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Carter Gould Great. Thank you. So, I didn't know we're going to have Terrie before today. But given the ozanimod sort of have been topic all this week why don't we start there. So, you reported your second positive Phase III [Indiscernible] at MS from RADIANCE yesterday. Definitely a lot of positive data certainly another encouraging sign moving towards approval. At the same time, there was a lot of focus on its disability data and the fact you guys didn't show a relatively high bar that was being set in terms of benefit versus an active comparator. Can you maybe just talk about how the data you have in-house today kind of sets you up for approval and then thinking about commercial? Terrie Curran Sure. Thanks Carter and good afternoon everybody. I think we're very excited about the Phase III data that we see. I think if you look at the base case for ozanimod, we expect to have an oral compound that is as efficacious as the ozanimod market with differentiated side effect profile and tolerability profile. So, I think if you look at the SUNBEAM trial, you'll see that there are a number of levers in terms of differentiation, lower liver toxicity, people -- some of the cardiac toxicity are now [Indiscernible] and then also if you look at lymphocyte recovery, much faster as well as having a shorter half-life. So, I think in totality, if you look at the profile, we're very excited and expected that it will be well differentiated. I think in terms of disability, I think it's important to note that there are no oral compounds that have achieved that endpoint versus an active comparator. I think we were very encouraged to see that the rights of disability progressions, if you look across MS trials more broadly, the rights that we saw across all three active lines were very low. In conjunction with the significant impact that ozanimod had on brain volume, is very encouraging and we expect to move towards bar by the end of the year. Carter Gould Okay. And then maybe just one more question in terms of how you see commercially, the positioning of ozanimod relative to Gilenya. Is this something where the streets should just be expecting ozanimod to compete with sort of Gilenya with new starts? Could we see actual patient switching off Gilenya? How are you thinking about that internally? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you look at the performance emerging in the Phase III, we do expect to be as efficacious as Gilenya, but have -- be differentiated in terms of side effects and tolerability. I think if you look at the liver toxicity, the cardiac toxicity as well as lymphocyte recovery, we expect that ozanimod will perform much better they are now. Our base case is to have a class label in terms of first dose monitoring. But I think as we see the totality of the data, we'll be able to have a conversation with the regulators and look to having some differentiation in the label. I think with -- both the specificity of the compound as well as the titration, we're not getting some of those off-target cardiac effects that we see with Gilenya.  Carter Gould Okay, great. Michael, maybe going back, starting with Revlimid. Seems to be the starting point of most of conversation. Michael Pehl That's the logic of starting. Carter Gould You've had a couple of successes here. Clinical and regulatory went with Revlimid and myeloma and really kind of opening up or expanding the European opportunity. I guess taking a step back, when you think about the front-line setting and maintenance in myeloma for Revlimid, is there any reason to think that the European market -- and I'm thinking about in terms of penetration duration can't match kind of what you're expecting or what you've seen already in the U.S.? Michael Pehl Yes, that's a very important question. And let me start by saying while Europe is more important when it comes to the opportunity coming from stem cell transplantation maintenance, there is an opportunity in U.S. already also. There is usage in U.S. since quite some time. But the label is not just allowing us to promote, there's kind of 50% of the patients that are first line and eligible for stem cell transportation, either don't get maintenance or get maintenance, but not until treatment in progression. So there's a true and sizable opportunity in the U.S. But then the opportunity in Europe is obviously bigger. We already have reimbursement in six European markets. So very, very quick. And we're working on others. The value proposition is extremely strong. We've been doing a meta-analysis. You may recall that with six -- with three clinical studies with more than 1,300 patients showing an over-survival benefit of more than 2.5 years for Revlimid maintenance. And I think that's really an unprecedented value proposition. So, I think it's not by chance that we're seeing this very rapid reimbursement in European markets. There's no reason to believe that in terms of penetration and duration, we should not get exactly where the U.S. is at. We just have to go through this 18 to 24 months of reimbursement negotiations before the different markets. But once that is done, I think we are very, very optimistic that we can catch up with the U.S., absolutely. Carter Gould Okay. And on that duration angle, certainly, when we run our models, that's a big driver of Revlimid's growth over the next -- through the balance of the decade. We've talked at length before around sort of the kinetics of the benefits from these novel-novel combinations sort of kicking in and sort of further accelerating sales growth. Can you maybe just walk through that a little bit? I think there's a point that flossed at a lot of investors and you sort of have to outpace the prior regimen's progression. And I guess at what point should we really kind of expect to see the benefit materialize and-- Michael Pehl Of course, a very relevant question as well. And once again, saying duration is a very important driver for us in terms of Revlimid performance. We have others. We talked about stem cell transportation. Lymphoma studies that are reading out for the end of the year. So there's more coming. But duration is definitely a key driver. Where we're at, at this moment in time is in the U.S., we have a treatment duration of round about 24 months. If we add our patients, who get Revlimid in first line and in any shape or form in a second or data line treatment, Europe is not quite there yet. They are 13 to 14 months. But for both sides of the Atlantic, treatment duration is increasing. And there's a couple of key drivers for that. Starting with the newly diagnosed labels that we're talking about. So if you can give Revlimid, your treatment duration is increasing. You should not forget that, especially in the maintenance setting, the treatment duration can be extremely long. The other key driver in that regard are the triplet regimen. And just to remind everybody, we've been seeing different triplet regimens reading out. The first ones that we saw with [Indiscernible] elotuzumab and with [Indiscernible], they had progression-free survival. And I think that's a very good surrogate for treatment duration of somewhere between 20 to 26 months. Now we see the daratumumab combinations with treatment durations up to 48 months. And that's just for the relapsed/refractory setting, that's also first treatment coming now in the first-line setting. RVD's an example, which has been showing a one-year over-survival benefit, also showing a progression-free survival of that magnitude. So, when you're thinking about 24 months in U.S. all-in and then 48 months plus with the new triplet regimen, there is still a real good and long way to go. To your point, in order to see this effect accelerating, you need to get over the 24 months that you're having already. We saw the approvals of the new triplet regimen starting like one to two years ago. So, I think by this year, we're starting to see the effects of the triplets kicking in. And the same thing is going to happen when we're looking at Europe, the stem cell transportation and the effect that it has on treatment duration. So, it's just going to take a little bit of time. You have to go beyond what you have already. But that's a very, very nice growth opportunity for the long-term for us without any doubt. Carter Gould And then just from a strategy and messaging, I mean the messaging around Revlimid has been fairly consistent or has been evolving in the same direction, right, give it early, give it often, give it through progression. But that -- I guess that messaging starts to get a little bit more complicated when you think about either patient segmentation, patient stratification as you get to the end of this decade and into next. It may sort of -- there's some low-hanging fruit, probably to put it a little too casually, but -- in the high-risk segment. But when you think about like after Revlimid and you start having to cut up these populations. I mean does that represent a challenge to you and your messaging or...  Michael Pehl Well, it almost represents a challenge in terms of bringing together translational data and clinical data in a way that I think is unprecedented, right? The current triplet reality is giving us a lot and a true improvement upon tablet reality. I just wanted to say this word of caution; not every myeloma patient can get a triplet. There's this large elderly frail population out there. The majority of patients with multiple myeloma is unfortunately over 75 years old. So, giving them triplets is not an easy thing. Again, the fact that the tablets of either -- whether it's pomalidomide or Revlimid is working so well as a tablet, I think makes what we're having also very, very unique. But when we're thinking about the next step -- and the next step is definitely this kind of long-term remission and even cure for patients. The starting point is to think about where is the medical need? And it's -- you can define this by different ways. There is a lot of patients, unfortunately, which starts to become refractory against four or five regimens, right? And those patients have a life expectancy of less than 1 year, sometimes even less than a couple of weeks. So, that's a way of looking at a patient population in need. We've been talking about the elderly frail patients already, where triplets is not an option. But then thinking more about the cumulative approach, the most efficacious triplet at this moment of time is probably Revlimid and daratumumab, right? And there was a New England publication on that. When you're looking at the progression-free survival cost in that publication, you see that a third of the patient is relapsing after six 12 months. Those patients, a third -- those patients have a life expectancy of three weeks -- of three years at a maximum. So, what we try to do at this moment of time is to try besides the obvious clinical segment, a molecularly defined segments of medical needs. Who are those patients? What is their genetics? What is the role of the immune system? What is the role of the microenvironment? Why are patients -- and that's another group at risk -- why is their patients are not achieving MRD-negative disease? And what is the biology of that disease? So that's one thing. So, we think we really make great progress in defining those molecularly and clinically. The second really important thing, especially when we think about bringing new technologies, such as BCMA, CAR-T early and broad, is can we come up with new endpoints. So, the traditional endpoint in multiple myeloma has been overall survival and progression-free survival, of course, both used as a surrogate for all. But we're making a very, very big effort together with academia and regulatory authorities and also in working together with other companies in trying to make sure that MRD-negativity is going to become an accepted endpoint for our study. And then as part of this effort we learn -- what we learn is what are the combinations and the therapeutic approaches that is most suitable for the segments that we have been defining. Not every combination is equal. There is probably combinations where you try to combine an EMIT [ph] and BCMA or BCMA alone. There's others where it's going to be an EMIT in the CD38. There's others where you're going to go for BCMA. And that's what we are learning. What we hope that we're going to have by the end of the year is all the data points necessary from our clinical studies, from our translational efforts, and from our regulatory efforts in order to be able to bring all of that together and then position the right combination and the right patient segment. That's the ongoing effort. Its complex, but I think it's going to be extremely rewarding because the result of that is going to be a very, very meaningful improvement of the outcome of those patients. Carter Gould Okay. Maybe switching gears to Revlimid. In follicular, you're going to have relevance and augment read out later this year. There's another, some of the incremental data coming at ASCO. When you think about ultimately, where Revlimid -- and really -- R square can be sort of positioned in follicular, I guess we often get some pushback from some docs. They see that more as a second-line regimen, even though you clearly are going after the front-line setting too. I guess what's the -- it might just be inertia from these docs, who just haven't had access to an overall combo before. But I mean, is there a higher clinical hurdle than just sort of bettering our chemo in that setting? Is there -- do you have to really kind of blow through it to get over that inertia and that's sort of entrenched to your point? Michael Pehl Yes. So, I think the way to think about and answer this question is really again, coming from the medical need. Where is the medical need? And just to remind everybody, so we are talking about in the lymph -- lymphoma, which is follicular lymphoma. There's a couple of others. Those are mostly elderly, frail patients with a very impaired immune system. The main treatment for those patients is the combination, as Carter said, of rituximab and chemotherapy that can be dropped, but then also others. Those patients are tolerating the chemotherapy extremely badly. It's like -- if you think about, this is a non-curative approach. Those patients are going to get progression-free survival for a period of time and then they are relapsing. The price to pay is weeks in hospital. You send those patients basically to hospitals for a very, very long time. What -- the other thing is the RAs are low, and remissions are very short-lived. I think the combination of all of that, when you think about it, makes us quite extremely effective -- extremely interesting and attractive. Very good tolerability profile. And I think we've been really generating data in hundreds of patients, whether you're talking about the magnified study. We have an update that is very interesting at ASCO. We also have the randomized study at the last ASH Congress in the first-line setting. So, extremely well-tolerated regimen, very high CR rate and very convenient. So, we really think that this is going to provide a great alternative. And as a consequence of the data that has been generated and system guidelines have been very broadly updated, I think it has this combination of medical need clear, great profile of the drug, great evidence. And so we think on the basis of the read out of the studies, R square is going to be a huge success in the population. Carter Gould Okay, great. Moving again to luspatercept, as somebody who covers both Acceleron and Celgene. It's been great to see the evolution your messaging to The Street here and the potential of this drug. I think most people acknowledge the drug, holds incredible promise in RS+ patients. The RS-, we saw some emerging data in that segment coming out of Valencia a couple of weeks ago. When you think ultimately about the potential of moving into that segment, you've already signaled that you're going to do one front-line study. Is it more a question of just when not, if you get around to moving into the RS- population or is efficient service still being hashed out? Michael Pehl I think it's -- it's actually both. It's a matter of when. And so for those of you have not been in Valencia, the data that Carter has been referring to is data of around about 60 patients that has been generated in a front line low risk MDS setting and in a population with an EPO level below 500 and a certain number of transfusions were below, the response rates were very high and the rate of transfusion independence was for both being zero plus positive and negative patients in the 50% to 60% mark, which is what you know from Revlimid and del 5q. So, incredibly good and very important durable improvements and transfusion independence for those patients. So, that is a large population. The current standard of care, by the way, is EPO, where you can get in the patient populations, where those products have worked well. You get low response rates and what you get is not durable. So, medical need is there, data that -- the ring sideroblast-negative observation is interesting. And from the observations that we have in the late-line lowest population where we only were -- we have a Phase III study ongoing that is only in the ring sideroblast-positive population, we were actually not quite sure whether it looks part of the business and would be an option for those patients or whether we would have to go into combination, which is something that we intended to explore. Anyway, but those new data suggests that we can include ring sideroblast-negative patients as well. Before we take in the front line trend, before we take the final decision, we just want to create a little bit more data in order to be sure. We're going to take a decision about the expecting fusion criteria by the end of the year so that we can start the study and somewhere -- kind of by the beginning of 2018. I think this is a very, very exciting observation. It can even further broaden beyond ring sideroblast-positive MDS and myelofibrosis, where we're also running studies and [Indiscernible] can even broaden the population for luspatercept. So, very exciting. We just want to be sure and create a little bit more data into next month and then we're going to move ahead full speed. Carter Gould Okay, great. Just coming back to myelofibrosis since you brought it up Mike, often referred as sort of the one -- myeloid indication that got away from you guys. When you think about moving luspatercept into that setting, is the plan to go after [Indiscernible], before [Indiscernible], in combination with [Indiscernible]. How do you think about where, I guess, coming back to your point, where the medical need in MS today? Michael Pehl Well, so the first thing that we need to do is to confirm the observation that has been obtained for the sister drug, which is sotatercept in a population and learn as to what -- and we -- and for those of you who don't know, so that was data shown at ASH with sotatercept in myelofibrosis, it was a Phase I/II study. So, those funding study and those patients achieved 40% of a transfusion independent, which is very, very remarkable. I think that's the highest that has ever been reported. So, we want to repeat the data with more translation of rigor, with luspatercept. And I think it's fair to say that, that's kind of the first study that we're going to do is in a population where geography is even not working on patients, who have [Indiscernible] already. I think in the longer term, the thinking is that you will probably like to combine those two. But the starting point is, for us, let's have a very clean population in order to learn as much as possible, hopefully, even in reaching patients further beyond what we've been seeing in our initial studies and then moving forward -- and that could actually then be -- also lead into the combinatorial approach. Carter Gould Terrie, coming back to you. I think about ozanimod going into IBD. We've had some incremental data from some competitors in ulcerative colitis earlier this week. I know we only have about two and a half minutes left. But if you can just kind of summarize to us kind of how you feel ozanimod sets up competitively in usage? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you think about the disease, there's a large unmet need. I mean many of these patients are progressing on to surgeries and the existing therapies within a year, many having relapses. So I think there's a real need within the therapy area for products that is effective, that is oral, that has kind of a reasonably benign safety profile. So, I think if you think about the ozanimod profile, it kind of ticks the boxes in those three elements. So, I think a large unmet need, chronic disease, where I think the profile of ozanimod would really fit perfectly in the first line. Carter Gould Okay. And when you think about the data we got out of RADIANCE, so at least, on the safety side, does that give you any more comfort with the safety thinking about and using it? Terrie Curran Yes, I think you see the safety profile in RADIANCE is very consistent with the safety profile that we saw in SUNBEAM. And I think if you look at the key elements, would there be cardiac safety, liver toxicity, lymphocyte recovery, we're seeing very, very positive and very excited about the profile. Carter Gould And on that safety side, I think everybody sort of -- or most people, I think appreciate the cardiotoxic and the burden that puts on caregivers in, at least, in that first dose. But when you -- can you maybe just expand on the toxicity and how important that is, how you think that might play out, at least... Terrie Curran So, I think if you think about tolerability, it's about 14% of patients discontinue Gilenya because of the other toxicity. So, if you look at the Phase III someday we're seeing much lower rates of toxicity and improve tolerability. So, from both decision's point of view and a patient's point of view, very compelling profile for that disease. Carter Gould Great. All right Terrie, Michael, thank you very much. Michael Pehl Thanks very much, Carter. Terrie Curran Thank you. Michael Pehl Thanks everybody. Terrie Curran Thank you.

So, I didn't know we're going to have Terrie before today. But given the ozanimod sort of have been topic all this week why don't we start there. So, you reported your second positive Phase III [Indiscernible] at MS from RADIANCE yesterday. Definitely a lot of positive data certainly another encouraging sign moving towards approval. At the same time, there was a lot of focus on its disability data and the fact you guys didn't show a relatively high bar that was being set in terms of benefit versus an active comparator. Can you maybe just talk about how the data you have in-house today kind of sets you up for approval and then thinking about commercial? Terrie Curran Sure. Thanks Carter and good afternoon everybody. I think we're very excited about the Phase III data that we see. I think if you look at the base case for ozanimod, we expect to have an oral compound that is as efficacious as the ozanimod market with differentiated side effect profile and tolerability profile. So, I think if you look at the SUNBEAM trial, you'll see that there are a number of levers in terms of differentiation, lower liver toxicity, people -- some of the cardiac toxicity are now [Indiscernible] and then also if you look at lymphocyte recovery, much faster as well as having a shorter half-life. So, I think in totality, if you look at the profile, we're very excited and expected that it will be well differentiated. I think in terms of disability, I think it's important to note that there are no oral compounds that have achieved that endpoint versus an active comparator. I think we were very encouraged to see that the rights of disability progressions, if you look across MS trials more broadly, the rights that we saw across all three active lines were very low. In conjunction with the significant impact that ozanimod had on brain volume, is very encouraging and we expect to move towards bar by the end of the year. Carter Gould Okay. And then maybe just one more question in terms of how you see commercially, the positioning of ozanimod relative to Gilenya. Is this something where the streets should just be expecting ozanimod to compete with sort of Gilenya with new starts? Could we see actual patient switching off Gilenya? How are you thinking about that internally? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you look at the performance emerging in the Phase III, we do expect to be as efficacious as Gilenya, but have -- be differentiated in terms of side effects and tolerability. I think if you look at the liver toxicity, the cardiac toxicity as well as lymphocyte recovery, we expect that ozanimod will perform much better they are now. Our base case is to have a class label in terms of first dose monitoring. But I think as we see the totality of the data, we'll be able to have a conversation with the regulators and look to having some differentiation in the label. I think with -- both the specificity of the compound as well as the titration, we're not getting some of those off-target cardiac effects that we see with Gilenya.  Carter Gould Okay, great. Michael, maybe going back, starting with Revlimid. Seems to be the starting point of most of conversation. Michael Pehl That's the logic of starting. Carter Gould You've had a couple of successes here. Clinical and regulatory went with Revlimid and myeloma and really kind of opening up or expanding the European opportunity. I guess taking a step back, when you think about the front-line setting and maintenance in myeloma for Revlimid, is there any reason to think that the European market -- and I'm thinking about in terms of penetration duration can't match kind of what you're expecting or what you've seen already in the U.S.? Michael Pehl Yes, that's a very important question. And let me start by saying while Europe is more important when it comes to the opportunity coming from stem cell transplantation maintenance, there is an opportunity in U.S. already also. There is usage in U.S. since quite some time. But the label is not just allowing us to promote, there's kind of 50% of the patients that are first line and eligible for stem cell transportation, either don't get maintenance or get maintenance, but not until treatment in progression. So there's a true and sizable opportunity in the U.S. But then the opportunity in Europe is obviously bigger. We already have reimbursement in six European markets. So very, very quick. And we're working on others. The value proposition is extremely strong. We've been doing a meta-analysis. You may recall that with six -- with three clinical studies with more than 1,300 patients showing an over-survival benefit of more than 2.5 years for Revlimid maintenance. And I think that's really an unprecedented value proposition. So, I think it's not by chance that we're seeing this very rapid reimbursement in European markets. There's no reason to believe that in terms of penetration and duration, we should not get exactly where the U.S. is at. We just have to go through this 18 to 24 months of reimbursement negotiations before the different markets. But once that is done, I think we are very, very optimistic that we can catch up with the U.S., absolutely. Carter Gould Okay. And on that duration angle, certainly, when we run our models, that's a big driver of Revlimid's growth over the next -- through the balance of the decade. We've talked at length before around sort of the kinetics of the benefits from these novel-novel combinations sort of kicking in and sort of further accelerating sales growth. Can you maybe just walk through that a little bit? I think there's a point that flossed at a lot of investors and you sort of have to outpace the prior regimen's progression. And I guess at what point should we really kind of expect to see the benefit materialize and-- Michael Pehl Of course, a very relevant question as well. And once again, saying duration is a very important driver for us in terms of Revlimid performance. We have others. We talked about stem cell transportation. Lymphoma studies that are reading out for the end of the year. So there's more coming. But duration is definitely a key driver. Where we're at, at this moment in time is in the U.S., we have a treatment duration of round about 24 months. If we add our patients, who get Revlimid in first line and in any shape or form in a second or data line treatment, Europe is not quite there yet. They are 13 to 14 months. But for both sides of the Atlantic, treatment duration is increasing. And there's a couple of key drivers for that. Starting with the newly diagnosed labels that we're talking about. So if you can give Revlimid, your treatment duration is increasing. You should not forget that, especially in the maintenance setting, the treatment duration can be extremely long. The other key driver in that regard are the triplet regimen. And just to remind everybody, we've been seeing different triplet regimens reading out. The first ones that we saw with [Indiscernible] elotuzumab and with [Indiscernible], they had progression-free survival. And I think that's a very good surrogate for treatment duration of somewhere between 20 to 26 months. Now we see the daratumumab combinations with treatment durations up to 48 months. And that's just for the relapsed/refractory setting, that's also first treatment coming now in the first-line setting. RVD's an example, which has been showing a one-year over-survival benefit, also showing a progression-free survival of that magnitude. So, when you're thinking about 24 months in U.S. all-in and then 48 months plus with the new triplet regimen, there is still a real good and long way to go. To your point, in order to see this effect accelerating, you need to get over the 24 months that you're having already. We saw the approvals of the new triplet regimen starting like one to two years ago. So, I think by this year, we're starting to see the effects of the triplets kicking in. And the same thing is going to happen when we're looking at Europe, the stem cell transportation and the effect that it has on treatment duration. So, it's just going to take a little bit of time. You have to go beyond what you have already. But that's a very, very nice growth opportunity for the long-term for us without any doubt. Carter Gould And then just from a strategy and messaging, I mean the messaging around Revlimid has been fairly consistent or has been evolving in the same direction, right, give it early, give it often, give it through progression. But that -- I guess that messaging starts to get a little bit more complicated when you think about either patient segmentation, patient stratification as you get to the end of this decade and into next. It may sort of -- there's some low-hanging fruit, probably to put it a little too casually, but -- in the high-risk segment. But when you think about like after Revlimid and you start having to cut up these populations. I mean does that represent a challenge to you and your messaging or...  Michael Pehl Well, it almost represents a challenge in terms of bringing together translational data and clinical data in a way that I think is unprecedented, right? The current triplet reality is giving us a lot and a true improvement upon tablet reality. I just wanted to say this word of caution; not every myeloma patient can get a triplet. There's this large elderly frail population out there. The majority of patients with multiple myeloma is unfortunately over 75 years old. So, giving them triplets is not an easy thing. Again, the fact that the tablets of either -- whether it's pomalidomide or Revlimid is working so well as a tablet, I think makes what we're having also very, very unique. But when we're thinking about the next step -- and the next step is definitely this kind of long-term remission and even cure for patients. The starting point is to think about where is the medical need? And it's -- you can define this by different ways. There is a lot of patients, unfortunately, which starts to become refractory against four or five regimens, right? And those patients have a life expectancy of less than 1 year, sometimes even less than a couple of weeks. So, that's a way of looking at a patient population in need. We've been talking about the elderly frail patients already, where triplets is not an option. But then thinking more about the cumulative approach, the most efficacious triplet at this moment of time is probably Revlimid and daratumumab, right? And there was a New England publication on that. When you're looking at the progression-free survival cost in that publication, you see that a third of the patient is relapsing after six 12 months. Those patients, a third -- those patients have a life expectancy of three weeks -- of three years at a maximum. So, what we try to do at this moment of time is to try besides the obvious clinical segment, a molecularly defined segments of medical needs. Who are those patients? What is their genetics? What is the role of the immune system? What is the role of the microenvironment? Why are patients -- and that's another group at risk -- why is their patients are not achieving MRD-negative disease? And what is the biology of that disease? So that's one thing. So, we think we really make great progress in defining those molecularly and clinically. The second really important thing, especially when we think about bringing new technologies, such as BCMA, CAR-T early and broad, is can we come up with new endpoints. So, the traditional endpoint in multiple myeloma has been overall survival and progression-free survival, of course, both used as a surrogate for all. But we're making a very, very big effort together with academia and regulatory authorities and also in working together with other companies in trying to make sure that MRD-negativity is going to become an accepted endpoint for our study. And then as part of this effort we learn -- what we learn is what are the combinations and the therapeutic approaches that is most suitable for the segments that we have been defining. Not every combination is equal. There is probably combinations where you try to combine an EMIT [ph] and BCMA or BCMA alone. There's others where it's going to be an EMIT in the CD38. There's others where you're going to go for BCMA. And that's what we are learning. What we hope that we're going to have by the end of the year is all the data points necessary from our clinical studies, from our translational efforts, and from our regulatory efforts in order to be able to bring all of that together and then position the right combination and the right patient segment. That's the ongoing effort. Its complex, but I think it's going to be extremely rewarding because the result of that is going to be a very, very meaningful improvement of the outcome of those patients. Carter Gould Okay. Maybe switching gears to Revlimid. In follicular, you're going to have relevance and augment read out later this year. There's another, some of the incremental data coming at ASCO. When you think about ultimately, where Revlimid -- and really -- R square can be sort of positioned in follicular, I guess we often get some pushback from some docs. They see that more as a second-line regimen, even though you clearly are going after the front-line setting too. I guess what's the -- it might just be inertia from these docs, who just haven't had access to an overall combo before. But I mean, is there a higher clinical hurdle than just sort of bettering our chemo in that setting? Is there -- do you have to really kind of blow through it to get over that inertia and that's sort of entrenched to your point? Michael Pehl Yes. So, I think the way to think about and answer this question is really again, coming from the medical need. Where is the medical need? And just to remind everybody, so we are talking about in the lymph -- lymphoma, which is follicular lymphoma. There's a couple of others. Those are mostly elderly, frail patients with a very impaired immune system. The main treatment for those patients is the combination, as Carter said, of rituximab and chemotherapy that can be dropped, but then also others. Those patients are tolerating the chemotherapy extremely badly. It's like -- if you think about, this is a non-curative approach. Those patients are going to get progression-free survival for a period of time and then they are relapsing. The price to pay is weeks in hospital. You send those patients basically to hospitals for a very, very long time. What -- the other thing is the RAs are low, and remissions are very short-lived. I think the combination of all of that, when you think about it, makes us quite extremely effective -- extremely interesting and attractive. Very good tolerability profile. And I think we've been really generating data in hundreds of patients, whether you're talking about the magnified study. We have an update that is very interesting at ASCO. We also have the randomized study at the last ASH Congress in the first-line setting. So, extremely well-tolerated regimen, very high CR rate and very convenient. So, we really think that this is going to provide a great alternative. And as a consequence of the data that has been generated and system guidelines have been very broadly updated, I think it has this combination of medical need clear, great profile of the drug, great evidence. And so we think on the basis of the read out of the studies, R square is going to be a huge success in the population. Carter Gould Okay, great. Moving again to luspatercept, as somebody who covers both Acceleron and Celgene. It's been great to see the evolution your messaging to The Street here and the potential of this drug. I think most people acknowledge the drug, holds incredible promise in RS+ patients. The RS-, we saw some emerging data in that segment coming out of Valencia a couple of weeks ago. When you think ultimately about the potential of moving into that segment, you've already signaled that you're going to do one front-line study. Is it more a question of just when not, if you get around to moving into the RS- population or is efficient service still being hashed out? Michael Pehl I think it's -- it's actually both. It's a matter of when. And so for those of you have not been in Valencia, the data that Carter has been referring to is data of around about 60 patients that has been generated in a front line low risk MDS setting and in a population with an EPO level below 500 and a certain number of transfusions were below, the response rates were very high and the rate of transfusion independence was for both being zero plus positive and negative patients in the 50% to 60% mark, which is what you know from Revlimid and del 5q. So, incredibly good and very important durable improvements and transfusion independence for those patients. So, that is a large population. The current standard of care, by the way, is EPO, where you can get in the patient populations, where those products have worked well. You get low response rates and what you get is not durable. So, medical need is there, data that -- the ring sideroblast-negative observation is interesting. And from the observations that we have in the late-line lowest population where we only were -- we have a Phase III study ongoing that is only in the ring sideroblast-positive population, we were actually not quite sure whether it looks part of the business and would be an option for those patients or whether we would have to go into combination, which is something that we intended to explore.

It can even further broaden beyond ring sideroblast-positive MDS and myelofibrosis, where we're also running studies and [Indiscernible] can even broaden the population for luspatercept. So, very exciting. We just want to be sure and create a little bit more data into next month and then we're going to move ahead full speed. Carter Gould Okay, great.

Cerner assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Marc Naughton, Chief Financial Officer of Cerner Corporation. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Thank you, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I\'ll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. Q1 was a good start to 2017, with bookings, revenue, and earnings all at the high end of our guidance ranges. Starting with bookings, our bookings in Q1 was $1.25 billion, which reflects a 7% increase over Q1 of 2016. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $16.098 billion, which is up 10% from $14.615 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.26 billion, which is up 11% over Q1 of 2016, driven by a strong growth in system sales and services. The revenue composition for Q1 was $320 million in system sales, $262 million in support and maintenance, $656 million in services, and $22 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to Q1 of 2016, then driven primarily by strong licensed software growth, as well as solid growth in technology resale. The higher level of software is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.6%, which is up 50 basis points over Q1 of 2016 and 150 basis points over Q4 of 2016. Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 11% compared to Q1 of 2016. Support and maintenance revenue increased 4% for the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 13% over the year-ago quarter to $1.13 billion and non-U.S. revenue declined 3% to $129 million. On non-U.S. revenue decline, note that currency fluctuations impacted revenue by about 2%, so revenue was basically flat on a constant currency basis. In addition, the primary driver of the lack of growth was a decline in non-U.S. technology resale. Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q1 was 84.2% which is basically flat compared to a year ago and up a 130 basis points compared to Q4 of 2016. Now I\'ll discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, and other acquisition-related adjustments which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. The adjustment for share-based compensation permanent tax items is a new adjustment this year to incorporate a new accounting standard adopted in Q1, which is designed to simplify accounting for share-based compensation. There is more information in our release, but we are basically reducing our adjusted earnings by the amount of the permanent tax benefit, so our results will be comparable to prior periods. In addition, not including this tax benefit should reduce significant swings in our adjusted tax rate that would occur if we did not adjust it out. Looking at operating spending, our first-quarter GAAP operating expenses of $817 million were up 9% compared to $747 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $773 million, which is up 10% compared to Q1 of 2016. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 12%. Software development increased 9%, driven by non-cash items as we had $4 million less capitalized software and $8 million more amortization than Q1 of 2016. G&A expense was up 3%. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $1 million. Moving to operating margins, our Q1 GAAP operating margin was 19.4% compared to 18.9% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in Q1, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period and in line with previously communicated expectations. Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $173 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $198 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, up 11% from $0.53 in Q1 of 2016. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%. When excluding the share-based compensation permanent tax items, the Q1 tax rate was 31%, which is basically flat compared to a year ago. Note that we also had a $3.3 million write-down of a venture capital investment as reflected in the other income line. Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $609 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $466 million in Q4. Moving to debt, our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $550 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $986 million, which is up from $945 million in Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 71 days, which is up from 69 days in Q4 and down from 76 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $304 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $88 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $144 million for the quarter. Note that our operating cash flow reflects certain classification changes required by the previously mentioned new accounting standard adopted in Q1. For Q1 2017, this impact resulted in approximately $12 million more operating cash flow than under the prior accounting guidance. We have also recast 2016 cashless to reflect this change, which resulted in Q1 of 2016 operating cash flows increasing by $9 million over what was previously reported. Regarding free cash flow, we still expect to increase our free cash flow by at least $150 million under the prior classification method. It also likely we will drive a similar increase under the new method, unless the tax impact of share-based compensation is materially lower in 2017. Either way, we expect strong free cash flow this year. Finally, you will see that we added a cash flow statement to our press release schedules. Now I\'ll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q2 of 2016. For the full year we continue to expect revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, reflecting 8% growth over 2016 at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, with a midpoint reflecting 5% growth over Q2 of 2016. For the full year, we still expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.44 to $2.56, with a midpoint reflecting 9% growth over 2016. Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint is basically flat compared to Q2 of 2016, which is our toughest comparable in 2016. We continue to expect bookings growth for the full year. In summary, we feel like we\'ve started the year on a solid note, and we have a good outlook for the rest of the year. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Zane. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I\'ll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I\'ll start with bookings. As Marc mentioned earlier, our Q1 bookings of $1.25 billion reflects 7% growth over Q1 of 2016. This growth was achieved without a new Cerner ITWorks contract, which we indicated was our expectation when we provided guidance. In total, 24% of bookings came from long-term contracts, which is flat compared to Q1 of 2016 but below the 30%-plus average for the past several years. As Mike will discuss, we remain confident this will be a good year for Works bookings, with stronger contributions expected to begin next quarter. The main highlight of the quarter was our competitiveness and volume of new footprints, as reflected in 37% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. This included multiple head-to-head wins against our primary competitor. A noteworthy example was being selected by a Top 100 health system located in a top 10 metropolitan area for a full suite of acute EHR, ambulatory and Revenue Cycle solutions. Additionally, we were selected by another organization in the Southeast that is one of the largest publicly owned health systems in the U.S. Finally, we continue to see our large health system clients move more of their sites to Cerner as they look to get off legacy systems and standardize on Millennium. One client this quarter contracted to move 10 sites from a competitor\'s legacy system to Cerner Millennium. And we have many more sites that could be transitioned to Cerner in the future. As we have discussed, our health system clients still have a significant number of sites on competitors\' legacy systems that represent future opportunities. Overall, our competitiveness is as good as it\'s ever been. We believe our primary competitor continues to be in a more defensive stance as a result of numerous factors, including cost overruns, that have impacted their clients financially and become more widely known in the marketplace. We also believe that our predictable total cost of ownership, contemporary architecture, ability to demonstrate value, and solid and strong population health capabilities position us to continue having success against this competitor and others. Beyond our strength in new business, we also had good contribution from other growth areas, such as population health and Revenue Cycle, with both positioned to deliver strong double-digit growth for the year. In population health, despite the uncertainty of exactly when the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care will occur, there continues to be a high interest in our population health solutions as providers realize they need to begin preparing for the shift long before it occurs. Further, we are able to demonstrate the ability of the HealtheIntent Platform to help our clients optimize performance in their fee-for-service business models while they are also preparing for new reimbursement models. In Revenue Cycle, the strength continues to be driven by both new EHR clients including Revenue Cycle with their purchase, as well as further penetrating our existing EHR base with our Revenue Cycle solutions. We are also seeing increased demand for Revenue Cycle services, including targeted projects, transition services, business office management, and full outsourcing. We also had a solid quarter in smaller venues with our Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings. In Ambulatory, we had success with extending our solutions to the ambulatory facilities of our large health system clients, which led to the displacement of several different ambulatory competitors during the quarter. We also had another strong quarter in Ambulatory Business Office Services. In CommunityWorks, we had a solid quarter that included multiple – beating multiple niche competitors. Activity remains high and we have a very good outlook for the year. Next, I\'d like to provide a quick update on our project with the Department of Defense. As we\'ve discussed, we had a successful first go-live earlier this year, and we remain on track for additional go-lives throughout the year. We are honored to be part of this project and we are very pleased with the early success, which is a result of great effort by the Department of Defense, Cerner, Leidos, and other partners. This project is making Cerner better, and I believe it ultimately benefits all our clients and is leading to enhanced implementation processes, advancements in cyber security, and sometimes connected technologies. We remained very focused on continuing to deliver for the Department of Defense, which we believe will help prepare and position us for other opportunities. Moving to our business outside the U.S., despite the flat revenue Mark mentioned, we had a strong start to the year from a bookings standpoint. The strength of bookings was broad-based with over 20% bookings growth in Canada, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the UK. Of note were two significant academic systems, including our first large client in Belgium and a very significant academic system in Australia. Both were won after rigorous and highly competitive selection processes that included our primary competitor. Now I\'d like to provide some observations on the U.S. marketplace. As I discussed last quarter, while there are unknowns about the future of Obamacare and the timing of the shift to value-based care, we are not seeing this have a material impact on our results. I think it\'s important to step back from the noise and consider that the dialog around Obamacare and its Republican alternatives is mainly focused on access and insurance reform, not care delivery reform. There isn\'t much of a discussion around the cost of care delivery. If not addressed, the cost implications of the baby boomers hitting retirement, increases in chronic conditions, and reimbursement being tied to volume will lead to our healthcare costs continuing to grow as a percent of GDP at an unsustainable rate. We continue to believe information technology is the single biggest lever to drive cost down and quality up. From a policy standpoint, we believe the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, is an important step in the right direction. Unlike meaningful use, which mandated EHR adoption without requiring proof of better outcomes, MACRA rewards providers who achieve better outcomes and penalizes providers who do not. As the payer for roughly 50% of the care in the U.S., the federal government can use their leverage to push towards value-based care, and now that the core system is mostly digital, they can demand the measurements that are needed to do this. With the change in the administration, we are seeing a predictable review, but most policymakers seem confident that MACRA and the overall shift to value-based reimbursement will continue. In our view, based on the forces and pressures that drive healthcare spending, it\'s hard to imagine ignoring the power of shifting from fee-for-service to a value-based system inside a competitive marketplace. And we clearly believe Cerner can play an important role in this shift. In summary, we believe we are well positioned in an active marketplace, with both near-term and long-term drivers of business opportunity for Cerner. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I\'m going to discuss ITWorks and some initiatives that are focused on driving operational efficiencies, while also improving our quality. I\'ll start with ITWorks. As Zane mentioned, and as contemplated in our forecast, we didn\'t have a new ITWorks deal in Q1. However, we did have an existing client expand and extend their ITWorks contract. We also had good sales back into our ITWorks base, which is an important part of our ITWorks model. Despite a lack of recent new deals, the ITWorks value proposition is resonating with many of our clients as we look to control costs, achieve operational excellence, and maintain security across the enterprise. Looking ahead, we believe – we still believe several of the opportunities we contemplated in 2016 will be closed in 2017, and we continue to add opportunities to our pipeline. In total, we believe 2017 could be a record year for ITWorks bookings. Now I\'d like to briefly discuss two examples of initiatives focused on driving quality and efficiency. The first example is our focus on clinician productivity and satisfaction. One of CERN\'s unique competitive advantages is our ability to leverage analytics to understand the user experience within our solutions. With a tool called Cerner Advance, we create the ability to measure the EHR efficiency of each clinician and benchmark them against peers by specialty and venue. This unparalleled ability allows us to proactively identify areas of opportunity, engage with our clients to create data-driven plans for improvement, and measure the impact of these changes. Over 8,000 users and 500 organizations have leveraged this capability to advance their organizations towards best practices that represent more effective and efficient utilization of our solutions. Another example of our focus is making our systems continuously available. One measure of this has been our ability to provide four nines of availability through our leading hosting capabilities. Going beyond this, we are now able to achieve continuous availability even during a Millennium release upgrade. This is significant – this is a significant achievement, and we have already performed many release upgrades without incurring downtime. This accomplishment takes us a step closer towards our goal of continuous delivery, which I discussed at our HIMSS Investor Meeting. Through continuous delivery, we expect to enable automatic deployment of updates and new innovations, which should significantly increase the rate of adoption, lower cost of ownership, and an improve or our speed to market. In summary, we believe these advancements will create significant value for our clients and drive tremendous productivity increases throughout Cerner. We also believe the ability to quickly deliver solutions at a lower cost will become more important as the financial pressures increase for our clients, and our ability to do this will become a competitive advantage. With that I\'ll turn the call to over questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it\'s a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn\'t see you in the market, although we\'ve seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and/or other cash activity this year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn\'t anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing – by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end – when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think – I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don\'t think – I think the future for us will be fairly consistent. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you\'re seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the – we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a – and that\'s kind of been a trend that we\'ve seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we\'ve seen that in terms of that percentage. As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we\'ve seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there\'s both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we\'re seeing the success that we\'ve had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after – we want to go after – that we\'re going after, and that there\'s a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they\'re of a bigger size than what we\'ve seen historically. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I think what we\'re saying is, it\'s kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky\'s question. In terms of this – in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Most of these are in-house situations, so they\'re not typically outsourced, but they\'re looking – as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline. What we\'re seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they\'re looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it\'s both the opportunity to move faster, it\'s also the execution success we\'ve had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms – and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We\'re able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model. We\'ve done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we\'ve been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we\'re able to jump off of and take the rest of the client\'s business in a bigger and broader space. And we\'ve earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that\'s allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we\'re seeing them – we\'re seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they\'re getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that\'s a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That\'s helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing – sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we\'re actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I don\'t think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we\'re looking – for the year, we\'re looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter\'s call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we\'re going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we\'re pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year. That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that – we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we\'re back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I\'m not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is – the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA\'s process? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, David. So, the – I\'ll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it\'s gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about. As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for – to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into – so, anything beyond that is speculation. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So we\'re taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we\'re taking share across all the competition. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it\'s going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It\'s really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we\'ve talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn\'t happened for a while. So we\'re definitely, we\'re excited about that. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don\'t know that I would absolutely say we\'ve got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we\'re also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half. So, I think that – as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it\'s not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. That\'s great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it\'s wasted, and move your way? I\'m just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don\'t have funding backing them up, and it\'s all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Great question. So it\'s interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there\'s not a total way – simple way to overly generalize, but I\'ll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they\'re doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they\'re actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have. And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that\'s part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that\'s one where they\'re trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it\'s a double positive for them. In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it\'s really – they\'re trying to do twofold. They\'re trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they\'re on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we\'re able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it\'s unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it\'s kind of – the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our – the ability to pay for it along the way. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I\'ll let – I\'ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven\'t really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we\'re seeing some good strength in is our back office – our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn\'t full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we\'re not – we\'re certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle. But I think certainly the interim services that we\'re doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that\'s what we\'re focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the – over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we\'ve done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues – of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that\'s proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we\'re seeing some of that play through in the pipeline. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. So, but for 2017, it\'s meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, it\'s doing well on the business office services level, and we don\'t have any big expectations for the bigger deals. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I would say it\'s an upside opportunity for us as we move forward. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, that\'s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So this is Zane. I think there\'s nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we\'ll let ... Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. ... people know on that side, and I think your question will – we can address more appropriately when we get to that point. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I\'m not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I\'m just thinking about the bookings revenue, and – versus – and really more on the software side. I\'m thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can\'t remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that\'s a data point relative to the licensed software. I\'d also point out that it\'s not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that\'s actually – that\'s the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from – that\'s recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well. So, I think that\'s, for us broadly you\'ve got the – Millennium\'s a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it\'s great business, but it isn\'t – we\'re not shifting models, it\'s additive to our business. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. That\'s really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you\'re growing that, but you\'re not – there\'s not a focus on transitioning it, and you\'re not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it\'s just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you\'re doing well on the one-time software side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky\'s questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you\'ve thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it\'s still a relatively small piece of your business? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. First, I\'ll start with – Jamie, I\'ll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part – so even though we\'ve taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we\'ve added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of – we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that\'s – and they\'ve been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it\'s in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us. On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there\'s been a slow economic recovery, and we\'re encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn\'t necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there\'s a good opportunity, I\'ve spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it\'s a – it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you\'re going to – the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn\'t translate to the income statement at this point. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That\'s great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie\'s question, I don\'t think I heard the answer that – can you quantify the opportunity that you\'ve got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We don\'t... Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. ... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Sean, we\'re not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it\'s a variety of sizes of places, there\'s a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it\'s part of our normal business. It\'s not – we don\'t see that as upside to the business, that\'s part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can\'t really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. No problem. How about – on ITWorks? So what I\'m hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven\'t heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that\'s going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into – or prospects convert into deals? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the – a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There\'s a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You\'ve got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need – I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I\'m going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment. I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn\'t have those same factors, that we\'re kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right. That\'s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. This is Zane. So, I think it\'s broad-based elements. We didn\'t have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity. But I\'ll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that\'s reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. And, it\'s still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike\'s discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I\'m interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions. Now if you tie that to – and that advantage can be realized whether you\'re hosting – whether we\'re hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly. So it doesn\'t necessarily have to be cloud-based, it\'s just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn\'t be – they couldn\'t do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there\'s any update to metrics you\'ve given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Usually that\'s a – those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we\'re providing an annual guidance, we don\'t update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get – go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don\'t – we do not update those during the year. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Why don\'t we take one more question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of – this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate – revenue run rate of a "large" ITWorks contract? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. This is Marc. It\'s really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that – in our current range is, it\'s probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that\'s coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you – kind of gives you a sense of what\'s in the current base. As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we\'re talking about multiple – opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that\'s – for us that\'s kind of the next step, once we\'ve gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn\'t have a history of outsourcing. We\'re not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Zane. I\'d say there is – there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it\'s more of a run rate that\'s begun once that opportunity is completed. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it\'s all part of a ... Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. ... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can – if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. That\'s helpful. Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. I appreciate it. I know you guys have got lots to do. So, I\'ll let you go. Have a good day. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it\'s a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn\'t see you in the market, although we\'ve seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and/or other cash activity this year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn\'t anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing – by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end – when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think – I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don\'t think – I think the future for us will be fairly consistent. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you\'re seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the – we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a – and that\'s kind of been a trend that we\'ve seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we\'ve seen that in terms of that percentage. As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we\'ve seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there\'s both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we\'re seeing the success that we\'ve had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after – we want to go after – that we\'re going after, and that there\'s a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they\'re of a bigger size than what we\'ve seen historically. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I think what we\'re saying is, it\'s kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky\'s question. In terms of this – in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Most of these are in-house situations, so they\'re not typically outsourced, but they\'re looking – as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline. What we\'re seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they\'re looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it\'s both the opportunity to move faster, it\'s also the execution success we\'ve had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms – and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We\'re able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model. We\'ve done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we\'ve been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we\'re able to jump off of and take the rest of the client\'s business in a bigger and broader space. And we\'ve earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that\'s allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we\'re seeing them – we\'re seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they\'re getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that\'s a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That\'s helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing – sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we\'re actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I don\'t think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we\'re looking – for the year, we\'re looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter\'s call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we\'re going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we\'re pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year. That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that – we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we\'re back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I\'m not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is – the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA\'s process? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, David. So, the – I\'ll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it\'s gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about. As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for – to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into – so, anything beyond that is speculation. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So we\'re taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we\'re taking share across all the competition. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it\'s going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It\'s really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we\'ve talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn\'t happened for a while. So we\'re definitely, we\'re excited about that. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don\'t know that I would absolutely say we\'ve got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we\'re also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half. So, I think that – as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it\'s not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. That\'s great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it\'s wasted, and move your way? I\'m just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don\'t have funding backing them up, and it\'s all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Great question. So it\'s interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there\'s not a total way – simple way to overly generalize, but I\'ll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they\'re doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they\'re actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have. And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that\'s part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that\'s one where they\'re trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it\'s a double positive for them. In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it\'s really – they\'re trying to do twofold. They\'re trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they\'re on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we\'re able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it\'s unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it\'s kind of – the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our – the ability to pay for it along the way. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I\'ll let – I\'ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven\'t really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we\'re seeing some good strength in is our back office – our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn\'t full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we\'re not – we\'re certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle. But I think certainly the interim services that we\'re doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that\'s what we\'re focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the – over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we\'ve done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues – of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that\'s proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we\'re seeing some of that play through in the pipeline. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. So, but for 2017, it\'s meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, it\'s doing well on the business office services level, and we don\'t have any big expectations for the bigger deals. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I would say it\'s an upside opportunity for us as we move forward. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, that\'s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So this is Zane. I think there\'s nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we\'ll let ... Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. ... people know on that side, and I think your question will – we can address more appropriately when we get to that point. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I\'m not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I\'m just thinking about the bookings revenue, and – versus – and really more on the software side. I\'m thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can\'t remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that\'s a data point relative to the licensed software. I\'d also point out that it\'s not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that\'s actually – that\'s the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from – that\'s recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well. So, I think that\'s, for us broadly you\'ve got the – Millennium\'s a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it\'s great business, but it isn\'t – we\'re not shifting models, it\'s additive to our business. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. That\'s really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you\'re growing that, but you\'re not – there\'s not a focus on transitioning it, and you\'re not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it\'s just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you\'re doing well on the one-time software side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky\'s questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you\'ve thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it\'s still a relatively small piece of your business? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. First, I\'ll start with – Jamie, I\'ll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part – so even though we\'ve taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we\'ve added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of – we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that\'s – and they\'ve been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it\'s in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us. On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there\'s been a slow economic recovery, and we\'re encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn\'t necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there\'s a good opportunity, I\'ve spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it\'s a – it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you\'re going to – the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn\'t translate to the income statement at this point. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That\'s great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie\'s question, I don\'t think I heard the answer that – can you quantify the opportunity that you\'ve got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We don\'t... Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. ... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Sean, we\'re not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it\'s a variety of sizes of places, there\'s a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it\'s part of our normal business. It\'s not – we don\'t see that as upside to the business, that\'s part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can\'t really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. No problem. How about – on ITWorks? So what I\'m hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven\'t heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that\'s going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into – or prospects convert into deals? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the – a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There\'s a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You\'ve got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need – I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I\'m going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment. I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn\'t have those same factors, that we\'re kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right. That\'s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. This is Zane. So, I think it\'s broad-based elements. We didn\'t have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity. But I\'ll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that\'s reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. And, it\'s still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike\'s discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I\'m interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions. Now if you tie that to – and that advantage can be realized whether you\'re hosting – whether we\'re hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly. So it doesn\'t necessarily have to be cloud-based, it\'s just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn\'t be – they couldn\'t do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there\'s any update to metrics you\'ve given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Usually that\'s a – those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we\'re providing an annual guidance, we don\'t update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get – go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don\'t – we do not update those during the year. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Why don\'t we take one more question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of – this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate – revenue run rate of a "large" ITWorks contract? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. This is Marc. It\'s really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that – in our current range is, it\'s probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that\'s coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you – kind of gives you a sense of what\'s in the current base. As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we\'re talking about multiple – opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that\'s – for us that\'s kind of the next step, once we\'ve gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn\'t have a history of outsourcing. We\'re not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Zane. I\'d say there is – there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it\'s more of a run rate that\'s begun once that opportunity is completed. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it\'s all part of a ... Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. ... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can – if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. That\'s helpful. Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. I appreciate it. I know you guys have got lots to do. So, I\'ll let you go. Have a good day. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were line in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual-camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track. Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations, and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms – iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS – that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams. We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy, since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and our Rest of Asia-Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven-week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was – wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From JPMorgan, Rod Hall. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 – 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim.

And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From JPMorgan, Rod Hall. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 – 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim.

Muse - Evercore Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Craig Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley Tore Svanberg - Stifel William Stein - SunTrust Chris Danely - Citigroup Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets Craig Ellis - B. Riley Tristan Gerra - Baird Stacy Rasgon - Bernstein Research Operator Good morning and welcome to the Analog Devices Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Earnings Conference Call, which is being audio webcast via telephone and over the web. I’d like to now introduce your host for today’s call, Mr. Ali Husain, Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours. Ali Husain Alright. Good morning and thanks, Jennifer. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining the Analog Devices second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. So let’s get through our disclosures. Note the information we are about to discuss, including our objectives and outlook, includes forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed in our earnings release and our most recent 10-Q. These forward-looking statements reflect our opinion as of the date of this call and we undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. Our commentary about ADI’s second quarter financial results, are adjusted for special items. When comparing our second quarter results to our historical performance, special items are also adjusted in the prior quarter and year-over-year results. Available reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our non-GAAP measures are included in today’s earnings release and on our web schedules which we have posted under the quarterly results section at investor.analog.com. As many of you know, we have completed the Linear Tech acquisition about halfway through our fiscal second quarter. And so we have included reconciliations in our Investor page that provide a greater level of detail into our standalone and combined results for the quarter. But at a high level, I will say that Linear contributed $208 million to our non-GAAP second quarter revenue. This number includes $60 million of purchase accounting adjustments that were made for U.S. GAAP purposes and relate to Linear Tech inventory that was in the distribution channel in North America and Japan when we closed the acquisition. At the end of the second quarter, there remains an additional $30 million of Linear inventory in the distribution channel, which we expect will be sold in its entirety in the third quarter. We have included this adjustment in our non-GAAP revenue expectations for the third quarter and no such adjustments are anticipated starting in the fourth quarter. And then the last point I will make and its information you should be mindful of is that the first quarter of our fiscal 2018 will be a 14-week quarter. Okay. So, with all that behind us, about to get the show on the road, I will turn it over to ADI’s CEO, Vincent Roche. Vince’s comments on the second quarter are for standalone ADI unless he specifies otherwise. And our business outlook for the third fiscal quarter relates to the combined company. Okay. Vince, all yours. Vincent Roche Thank you very much, Ali. Good morning, everyone. Well, it’s been a very busy period for ADI and I am pleased to share our results with you. Not only were our second quarter financial results stellar, but we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech in March and our integration work is going very well. So, let’s start with our financial results for the second quarter. ADI’s standalone revenue came in at $1 billion, a 2% sequential increase and a 28% increase over the prior year. These results were above our revised guidance on broad-based strength and we continue to see signs of a good business environment, particularly in the industrial market. Gross margins expended to 67.6%, which was above the high end of our guidance and the combination of higher sales, higher gross margins and tight control over operating expenses helped to expand operating margins to a robust 36% of sales. In addition, free cash flow margins, as a combined company, were also strong at 39% of revenue in the second quarter. As Ali mentioned, Linear Tech was part of ADI for about half the quarter and contributed $208 million in sales on a non-GAAP basis. And we are looking forward to a full quarter’s contribution in our third quarter. Now, let me give you some details of our performance by end market during the quarter and note that my remarks relate only to standalone ADI. The industrial markets at 46% of sales grew 15% sequentially in the seasonally strong second quarter and continued its year-over-year growth trajectory, increasing 20% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth was broad-based across all industrial sectors and indeed regions. While business conditions are certainly more positive than they were at this point last year, our success is also the result of smart R&D investments across diverse industrial applications within factory automation, instrumentation, aerospace and defense and healthcare. Over several decades, ADI has carved as a leadership position in high performance signal processing, serving our tens of thousands of industrial customers where applications demand the highest levels of performance both in terms of signal chain and in terms of power optimization. In the near-term, our industrial customers are excited to gain access to the highly complementary portfolios of ADI and Linear Tech and are even more excited at the future of value creation opportunities made possible by our combination. The automotive market represented 15% of our sales in the second quarter and grew 8% sequentially and 9% over the prior year. Both sequential and year-over-year growth was broad-based across all automotive application areas and was strongest in safety and ADAS applications, while powertrain revenue increased, but at a slower pace. We supply thousands of products into dozens of automotive sub-applications and are gaining more dollar content as we further automate and electrify. The combination with LT dramatically strengthens our technology offerings in this market and expands additional dollar content opportunities across our very complementary customer base. The communications infrastructure market, at 18% of sales, grew 5% sequentially and 4% over the prior year. Sequential revenue growth in this market was led by wireless infrastructure applications where we are making very good progress with our RF and microwave and high-speed signal processing and integrated transceiver solutions. While we are, of course, only in the very early stages of 5G cellular infrastructure deployment, we believe that our optimized radio signal processing and power management solutions will be a very key driver of growth as channel counts increase and customers moved to phase their antennas to make the most efficient use of available spectrum with the highest reliability and performance. Of course, the wireless infrastructure market is one where Linear largely didn’t play and thus this market represents an opportunity to drive revenue synergies in the medium term. On a year-over-year basis, communications infrastructure growth was led by the wireline sector where ADI’s customers are benefiting from our position clocking, timing and control technologies in the 100-gig and beyond optical networking applications. And finally, consumer market revenues at 21% of sales decreased 24% sequentially as prosumer applications revenue increased and portable applications revenue came in better than planned. Compared to the prior year, both prosumer and portable applications revenue increased. So while our combined financial results were excellent, our near and long-term outlooks are equally bright. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Linear Tech, creating the high-performance analog market leader. As we said from the beginning, we are taking a best of both approach combining the best from ADI and LTC to come up with a new operating system to drive long-term profitable growth for our combined company and I am very pleased with the progress we have already made. We are optimizing processes across our selling, new product development, manufacturing and operations activities. On the sales side, the integration of our two sales forces has brought with it a tremendous degree of excitement and we have already identified many sales synergy opportunities. On the engineering side, our teams have come together at remarkable speed and have begun identifying product roadmap combinations that we expect over the long-term will accelerate our growth. On the manufacturing side, our teams have been focused on ensuring that we meet the upside demand and continue to deliver the highest quality products to our customers. Overall, our $150 million cost synergy target within 18 months of the acquisition is firmly on track. To give you some background, during the integration planning phase, the vast majority of actions needed to realize the synergy target were identified. And while many of the related actions have already been taken, we are only in the early stages of seeing the benefits of those synergies in our P&L. In addition we expect non-GAAP EPS accretion in our first full quarter as a combined company to be 15% and we expect earnings accretion to accelerate into fiscal 2018 as we begin to more fully realize the synergies from the transaction. So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Ali for details of our financial performance in the second quarter. Ali Husain Great. Thanks Vince. Good morning everybody. Since the acquisition of Linear Tech occurred about half way through our second quarter, Linear Tech’s contributions to ADI’s results were limited to approximately seven weeks and my prepared remarks will exclude Linear’s results and other special items unless I specify otherwise. Note that a schedule reconciling our standalone and combined performance can be found in our Investor page at investor.analog.com and a reconciliation of our combined GAAP performance to our combined non-GAAP performance can be found in schedules E and F of today’s earnings release. So revenue in the second quarter increased to $1 billion growing 2% sequentially and 28% over the prior year and was above our revised guidance. Sequential revenue growth was led by our B2B markets of industrial, automotive and communications infrastructure, which in the aggregate grew 11% sequentially and importantly 14% over the prior year. Gross margins in the second quarter were 67.6%, up 150 basis points from the 66.1% we achieved in the prior quarter, primarily the result of higher utilization rates. Days of inventory increased 3 days to 104 days and dollars of inventory increased $12 million sequentially as we increased production to match strong demand. Deferred revenue for shipments in the distribution increased 6% sequentially and weeks of inventory in distribution were at seven weeks, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Operating expense of $318 million increased 4% sequentially due to the natural lift from higher activity in the second quarter and as compared to the first and higher variable compensation in the second quarter as our bonus program responded a better year-over-year revenue growth and operating profit in the quarter. As a result, operating margins of 36% of sales expanded 500 basis points compared to the prior year on strong revenue growth, higher gross margins and prudent expense management by the team. So now for P&L line items below the operating margin line, I will talk to results on a combined company basis, excluding special items, outlined in today’s release. Other expense in the second quarter was $59 million, the result of a partial quarter with the financing related to the Linear Tech acquisition in place. We expect our net interest expense to be approximately $70 million in the third quarter and approximately $60 million per quarter thereafter. Our second quarter non-GAAP tax rate was approximately 10% and that’s the rate we expect for the remaining two quarters of the year. We are also planning for a non-GAAP tax rate in 2018 to be approximately 15%, so note that will be higher than the 10% rate this year. Our diluted share count increased in the quarter due to the equity consideration related to the acquisition. Since this is a weighted average calculation, the diluted share count in 2Q increased to 346 million shares and we expect diluted share count in the third quarter, which will be our first full quarter as a combined company to be approximately 375 million shares. Excluding special items, diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2017 was $1.03. The second quarter was also a very strong free cash flow quarter. As a combined company, we generated $475 million in free cash flow in the second quarter. And for the reported trailing 12 months, the combined company has generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, which translates to free cash flow margins of 37%. Now this level of free cash flow generation is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it reflects the strength of our business model and our brand. Second, it means that our EBITDA generation was also very strong. And this means that we are better positioned from a leverage ratio standpoint at the current time than we had – than we have communicated to you earlier. So as a result, our net debt to EBITDA ratio based on reported combined company results is in fact approximately 3x, which is significantly lower than the 3.8x net debt to EBITDA number that we had estimated when we announced the deal. So moving to capital additions, which in the second quarter were $47 million for the combined company and are planned to be in the range of $200 million to $220 million for the year in 2017. During the quarter, we also paid $139 million in dividends and earlier this week, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on June 20 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 9. And that represents an annual dividend payment to shareholders of $1.80 per share. Okay. So with that, I will turn it back over to Vince for our outlook for the third quarter of 2017, which again is on a combined company basis and excludes special items outlined in today’s release. Vincent Roche Thanks Ali. After a strong second quarter performance, we are planning for a continued sequential and year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter and for revenue to be in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion. By end market, we are planning for continued sequential revenue growth in industrial and for the communications end market to remain stable to the prior quarter. In automotive, we anticipate that seasonal trends would prevail, which would suggest a mid single-digit sequential decline in the third quarter. In the consumer market, we are planning for modest sequential revenue growth in the third quarter. We expect gross margins to be between 69% and 70% as we keep utilization levels stable to their second quarter rates and benefit from higher industrial revenue mix. We estimate that operating expenses will be between $430 million and $440 million. Notably, this translates into an operating margin range of 38% to 40% in the third quarter. Based on these estimates and excluding special items, diluted earnings per share are planned to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.21. While we continue to see good business conditions, we are always pragmatic and cautious in how we manage our business and in how we convert our precious resources into free cash flow. On this point, with the combination complete, ADI’s free cash flow margin now ranks within the top 5% of the S&P 500. At our Investor Day on June 20, we will outline our plan to drive the long-term profitable growth for ADI, leveraging the customer value creation capabilities of our innovation and business diversity and our focus on best-in-class operational efficiencies to continue to drive our free cash flow to even higher levels. So with that, we are ready now to take your questions. Ali Husain Alright. Thanks Vince. So before we get to the Q&A session, just a couple of quick housekeeping items for me. So note that we will be hosting an Investor Day on June 20. It’s accessible via live webcast. I invite you all to tune in on June 20 to hear more about our long-term strategy and the new financial model for the company. And so let’s get to the Q&A session. We will try our best to get to all of our callers, so please limit yourself to one question. After our initial response we will give you an opportunity for a follow-up. So operator, can we have our first question, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Ambrish Srivastava Hi, thank you very much for letting me ask questions. I had a medium-term question Ali and maybe you could answer that and then I had a longer term follow-up for Vince. So for the medium-term, could you please help us frame the consumer business, how – and when I say medium term, I am thinking how should we be thinking about this over the next 6 months to 18 months? And then I had a follow-up for Vince. Ali Husain Okay. Sure. Thanks Ambrish. Look I guess what I would tell you is our strategy in consumer is no different than our strategy in any of our markets. We focus on very tough problems that our customers have. We work to solve those for them. We try and create as much value as possible for our customers. And in turn that tends to generate a lot of free cash flow for ADI. I would say the only difference in consumer, relative to our other markets is that the product life cycles tend to be a little bit shorter. But apart from that, I would say the strategy at ADI is very, very consistent across all of our markets. Now you have seen that strategy play out over the last couple of years. We have grown our consumer business nicely. It’s generated a lot of free cash flow for the company. We have diversified our position in consumer both at our large customer. We have diversified our position across many other customers and into new vectors of growth that we think will drive consumer free cash flow and revenue growth over the long-term. All that being said, you know as well as I do that the consumer market tends to have shorter lifecycles. And so as a result, you can’t have periods of time where you have got some older designs that are rolling off and there is a bit of a pause between that happening and newer designs rolling on. My sense is that we are likely in one of those periods at the current time. I expect as a result, our mix of B2B markets to expand as a percentage of our revenue as we get into the back half of 2017. And I would expect that to continue into 2018 as well. I guess, the only other point I would make is just to provide a little bit more context, Ambrish, is we manage a very complex mix of portfolios and businesses at ADI. Each one of them have different lifecycles. Each one of them have different revenue growth profiles. Each one of them have different profitability profiles. But what I would tell you is as long as ADI is focusing on very tough solved problems to solve for our customers and we can drive a lot of free cash flow. And frankly, if we are meeting our hurdle rates and we can drive really good long-term profitable growth in free cash flow, we will play, because ultimately that’s the measure. Vince mentioned it in the prepared remarks we are now a top 5% S&P 500 free cash flow generator. And our goal is to drive that even higher from here. Operator Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. C.J. Muse Yes, hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. First clarification, in terms of the revenue guide, was that combined or did that exclude old Linear? And then I guess as my main question just to follow-up on Ambrish’s question around consumer. Is that a business looking into calendar ‘17 and ‘18 that can grow given that you have brought on diversification increase to customer or is that something that we should be thinking about declining over the next 1, 2 years? Ali Husain Okay. So I think that was your first question and a follow-up. So, I think on the revenue side, we have provided combined company guidance for both companies and the range is $1.37 billion to $1.45 billion that would imply a midpoint of $1.41 billion. And I guess if you were just to think about how that flows by end markets, C.J., we expect the industrial market again had a very good second quarter. We expect that strength to continue into the third quarter. As a result, we are expecting industrial to grow somewhere in the low to mid single-digits sequentially in the third quarter, which again would be better than seasonal. Automotive, we are expecting a pretty seasonal quarter. So, as a result that would decline kind of in the mid single-digits sequentially. Communications is implied to be relatively stable. And on the consumer side, we are expecting modest sequential growth relative to the second quarter. And Vince, did you want to take the question about consumer implied growth in 2017 and 2018? Vincent Roche Yes. I think as Ali said, we experienced fundamentally shorter lifecycles in the consumer markets. And we have been working very, very hard over the last couple of years to diversify our product base and our customer base, the application base within consumer and we are making good progress of that. I think as we look into the third quarter, as Ali said, we are seeing modest sequential revenue growth, but nonetheless below what we would consider to be seasonal norms. So we are probably in a slower growth environment in the consumer business for the near-term here. Ali Husain And I’d say, C.J., if I could just add two points. One is we do expect as a result, our B2B markets to expand as a percentage of total revenue. And I think as you look into 2018, the accretion from the Linear Tech deal is very strong here in the third quarter, about 15%. And given some of the synergies that we have talked about, we expect that EPS accretion to accelerate into 2018 and I think that would be a very strong result. So, can we get to our next caller? Operator Our next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Harlan Sur Good morning. Congratulations on the strong results. Given the stronger industrial demand flow and outlook for continued growth, just wondering if you guys are seeing any component tightness or lead time stretching out? I know a few of your peers have highlighted some tightness. I am just – it sounds like you guys still have more room to grow on utilization, but wanted to get your views on the supply side situation? Ali Husain Thanks. Good question, Harlan, one that we obviously think about a lot as well. But I would tell you, we are delivering the vast majority of our products within our stated lead times of 4 to 6 weeks. That frankly hasn’t changed all that much over the last several quarters. I guess, what I would tell you is that ADI we are very focused on providing the highest levels of customer service and support and part of that service and support model is to deliver products when we tell our customers that we are going to deliver them. And so we tend to keep our lead times pretty short, 4 to 6 weeks delivering the vast majority of our products within those stated lead times. And I guess, I would also tell you that we are carrying 3.5 months worth of inventory in our balance sheet, which I think is a fair amount of inventory to help supply our customers with the products. The only one other point I perhaps make in this front is that if you recall back in 2016, we did bring our utilization rates down pretty hard. And the reason we did that is we wanted to manage our DSI or days of inventory down. And we managed the impact on gross margins by making permanent improvements in our cost structure. And I think as you now look out to 2017 and 2018, I think what investors should expect from ADI is a nice benefit on the drop-throughs, because as we are building the inventory, the drop-throughs are certainly better. But I guess, just coming back to your earlier point on the lead times, vast majority delivered within 4 to 6 weeks and we are keeping up high levels of service to our customers. Did you have a follow-up? Harlan Sur No, I’m good. Thank you. Ali Husain Okay. Operator Our next question is from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Craig Hettenbach Yes, thank you. Question for Vince, I just wanted to follow-up on your comments around automotive with Linear Tech. And more specifically, can you talk about how expansive your opportunity set is, so if there is any examples of things that you think they will help you expand the content within automotive? Vincent Roche Yes. So automotive for us is a story of continuing content gain here for both LTC and for ADI. So, we see it as a key growth market for the combined companies. So I think we have talked before about ADI having great strength in emerging applications like, for example, 77-gigahertz radar, LIDAR infotainment with our A2B technology, for example, bringing new technologies into the powertrain, such as the rotationals and Linear sensing, magnetic devices. And as the powertrain electrifies being able to get our battery management technologies in there as well. So, I think both LTC and ADI have a lot of complimentary capability, for example, to the ADI signal chains that I have just talked about here, we are adding LTC power management capability. And the outcome of that is we can architect an optimized solution for each of the sub-applications here for the automotive customers. And there is great complementarity between the signal chain and the power chain. So I think that’s looking very, very good. And also, there is a lot of new power management things that we are looking at independent of signal chains that LT will be instrumental in helping us nail down over the coming few years. So, there is a tremendous amount of benefit in coupling power management with the signal chain. And every single application which we play within the transportation automotive sector requires both signal chain and power management. And what I am seeing so far is the tremendous level of collaboration between the applications teams, the design teams and really grabbing the opportunities here with both hands. Ali Husain Great. Thanks, Craig. Did you have a follow-up? Craig Hettenbach Yes. I guess just a brief one, just on the integration, good to hear that it’s on track and kind of good start out of the gate. Just any comments in terms of culture, key people and kind of milestones we should be aware of? Vincent Roche Well, we have known that LT is a very, very high-quality company. And I have been obviously hands on involved in the integration of the two companies. I am very, very impressed by the quality of the people throughout LT and I am also very impressed with just how fast both companies are coming together to create something better than the sum of the parts. So right now, we are laser focused on leveraging the combined strengths of both companies to generate this long-term profitable growth possibility that we know is there. And we are taking our time to really figure out – we have been very, very patient at figuring out how to combine the leadership – we have combined the leadership teams, but we have been very patient in trying to figure out what the best of both really means here. So I think to answer your question, very directly here Craig, we are culturally I think in good shape. Our values as I have talked about many times before, the values around technology and business and customer are very, very similar. And in creating this best of both, we are actually leveraging the differences in the way the operating routines of both companies to draw from, to create something greater than some of the parts. So we are focused as I said on delighting our customers, ensuring that we are capturing the upside demand here. And I think overall the – once the values are compatible, as I said I am using the cultural differences to create something greater than the sum of the parts. And the LT leadership is playing a key role. I have got two members of the senior LTC staff and my staff. And the LT leaders are contributing to this new company multiple levels down at this point in time. Craig Hettenbach Great. Thanks. Ali Husain Thank you. We will get to our next caller. Operator And our next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Vincent Roche You are back, good. Ambrish Srivastava Hi. Thank you. I had my follow-up keyed up. For some reason I got dropped off. Thanks for accommodating me back. I wanted to get back to the capital allocation and the free cash flow, it seems like the free cash flow generating ability might be higher than at least what our models were suggesting. So could you please remind us just in terms of capital allocation and the timing for the pay down, obviously the leverage ratio was lower than what you had communicated and what it was at the deal close, so any light on that would be very helpful? Thank you. Ali Husain Okay, fair enough. I will leave the key take away for next month when we present to you at the Analyst Day, because I think we want to save a little bit of dry powder for that. But what I would tell you is since we announced the acquisition, there is a couple of things. One is we set out this target of 3.8x net debt to EBITDA. And then a typical ADI fashion, we put out targets and we had executed extremely aggressively against those targets. And part of it is just coming out at a lower leverage ratio is just a function of the mindset at ADIs. We execute extremely aggressively against the targets that we lay out. Part of it is like business conditions have been better and as a result, we have generated more cash flow. And part of it frankly is just having a laser focus on operational efficiencies. And so that’s driven a lot of good cash flow as well. The good news I guess from a leverage perspective as we have talked about is we are certainly well ahead of schedule in terms of the de-leveraging plan. The bogie we are shooting for is 2x net debt to EBITDA and I would say we are probably ahead of schedule in trying to hit that number. Once we get to that number, I think we have been pretty public in terms of saying, look we are going to turn the share buyback program back on. In the meanwhile the dividend remains a cornerstone of our capital allocation strategy. And then the only other last point I would make is and again this kind of supports the notion of that we are ahead of schedule is after the quarter ended, we did pay $200 million down on the $5 billion term loan balance. So I think we are certainly ahead of schedule and in very good shape on that front. Ambrish Srivastava Okay. Thank you very much. Ali Husain Okay, great. Operator Your next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. So the industrial market is growing very strongly, I believe you mentioned 20% year-over-year, how much of that is the market coming back versus perhaps more electronic content or even some share gains? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. I think it’s true to say that first off we are recovering from a relatively weak environment in the prior year. So the compare is kind of easy from that perspective. From everything that we can tell right now, the growth is broad based across all the industrial sectors and in fact across all the geographies as well. And I think that’s just a function of the better business environment versus last year overall. And if you just paying attention to our own customers as well, they are all guiding for low to high single-digit growth in 2017. As a company, several years ago, we made a strategic pivot in terms of where we placed our R&D, putting more into B2B applications. And industrial has been a great beneficiary of that. So I think just given the cycles in the industrial sector in general, we are beginning to see some of those products really contribute in a meaningful way across factory and process automation, aerospace and defense, the instrumentation ATE business. And so I think the business environment is overall better, but we are also doing better in terms of grabbing share through the effects of our new product investments over the last several years. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Tore Svanberg Yes. Thank you. Vince, you also mentioned earlier that you plan to leverage Linear Technology into the wireless infrastructure market, I was just hoping you could elaborate just a little bit more on that because certainly, that’s a market that’s been weaker the last 2 years, but I assume with 5G coming on, your plan is to leverage both entities to participate in that market? Vincent Roche Yes. Thanks Tore. Well, we are – as ADI organic, we have been doing better and better in terms of building solutions for our customers from antenna right down to bits, leveraging the strength of ADI and Hittite combined. And we know that as customers put greater and greater pressure on for more integration, to be able to solve the noise problems more effectively in these radio systems, that power management is going to be a great help to us. And already, I think in the shorter term, we are being actively engaged in discussions to use existing products with ADI solutions, for example, in the transceiver space, in 5G systems, leveraging LTE’s power technology. And that’s only the beginning because over the coming generations when we can start to architect the radio solutions now with the new advances in power management technology that LT has been making, I think we can have several generations here of success in both the wired and the wireless business in the years ahead. And there is no doubt there is tremendous symbiosis between the signal chain technologies that ADI has been so strong in over the years with the power technologies that LT now brings to the table. So the conversations with our customers are very active and with existing products and we are now plotting the next new architectures based on the combination of the two companies. Tore Svanberg Alright. Thank you. Ali Husain Thank you very much. Next question please. Operator Your next question is from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks for taking my question. I am hoping you can expand on something you touched on earlier, the cultural differences, however may be they are not as great as some people perceive, but I think one of them is that Linear was known for having an intense focus on gross profit margin and perhaps that limited that business’ revenue growth and I think ADI has a more growthy sort of outlook. So I am wondering if you can sort of highlight any initial opportunities to expand the growth rate on the Linear business? Vincent Roche Yes. It’s a good question. It’s true that both companies have had very, very strong focus on gross margin. I think it’s a great kind of proxy for the quality of the innovation that you are developing, the price you can command and ultimately, the gross margins that you can get. So what I will say is that ADI has probably just – given our buying power, their operational focus. We have combined now with LT we have got more buying power. So we can be more flexible in terms of taking some market share with products already available without sacrificing the margins, just giving the signings of the so called bill of materials that we are now sourcing across both companies. So we don’t intend to drop our standards, but we do intend to be aggressive in terms of leveraging all the available products and technologies that we have to grow our business profitably. I think that’s the way to think about it. Ali Husain And did you have any follow-up, Will? William Stein I did. One of the issues from the integration that’s always important in any of these transactions is ERP, and by the disclosure around end markets that sort of lumps the Linear Tech revenue in its own category maybe a sign that perhaps that’s going to take a bit of time to reflect their revenue across your end markets. Any guidance or commentary as to when we should see that disclosed sort of on a combined basis and just in general the update on that aspect of the integration? Ali Husain Yes, fair enough. I can take part of that. Look, from an ERP’s perspective and frankly from an integration perspective, we are generally keeping Linear Tech on a standalone basis for the first year. And then we will converge. With regards specifically to the end market question, we actually have the data. I just didn’t feel like it was that meaningful for a stub quarter and I can certainly talk to it right now in the call. But you should expect from ADI next quarter that we have all of the disclosures by end markets mapped out and that’s absolutely no issue to do. What I would tell you in the quarter, had Linear been part of ADI for a full quarter, they would have seen their industrial business grow and they would have seen their automotive business decrease sequentially given their exposure to the powertrain market, specifically in transportation in China, which has been a weaker market. But the good news there I’d say well is that, that market is actually pretty stable right now and that gives us a fair amount of confidence guiding into the third quarter, then automotive will be pretty seasonal. William Stein Great. Thank you. Ali Husain Yes, no problem. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from Chris Danely with Citigroup. Chris Danely Hey, thanks, guys. Congratulations on the good quarter and good guidance. Now that Linear is kind of lumped into the mix, how, if you could, frame the October quarter for the combined company just in terms of where combined OpEx could go? Could it go down again? And then also what should we expect for seasonality for revenue for the combined company for the October quarter? Ali Husain Yes. Okay, so let me try and parse that out a little bit and may be Vince can help me as well. But look from a – Chris, we have absolutely no visibility into the fourth quarter, the October quarter at this stage. So in the absence of any orders, all I can rely on is what seasonal trends tend to do and seasonally speaking industrial tends to be a little weaker in the fourth quarter. Automotive generally increases. Communications is always a wildcard just frankly depending on how the builds and the deployments are going. And then consumer generally has a pretty good growth quarter sequentially, because you start to see more of the builds taking place. So, that’s all I can tell you today, with absolutely zero visibility into the fourth quarter. What I would tell you on the OpEx side and I’d say it’s a fair point is on a standalone basis this quarter ADI had OpEx of $318 million. Linear Tech contributed $62 million in the quarter. I guess I would caution you on that number. One is obviously it’s a stub period and so it’s a partial quarter. And number two, there were public company costs that did come out of that number, which we have always talked about public company costs being somewhere in the range of $15 million to $20 million annually. And so the quarterly run-rate that we have guided to for operating expenses in the third quarter of $430 million to $440 million already includes those synergies embedded. Now to your other point, there are more synergies on the comp. We will start to see some of them. It will be very back end loaded there, Chris in the third quarter, but you will start to see more of them play out in the fourth quarter. And I would expect them to be then pretty linear back into the fourth quarter of 2018. If you recall, we have always talked about $100 million of OpEx synergies achieving that run-rate by the fourth quarter of 2018. I guess, what I am saying is $20 million of that is now baked into the third quarter run-rate number and there is still another $80 million to come, again on an annualized number as we go into the fourth quarter of 2018. Chris Danely Great. Do I get a follow-up? Ali Husain Of course. Chris Danely Thanks. Any update on the CFO – new CFO? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, let me tell you, Chris, we have – obviously we have retained a search firm. And what I can tell you is that we are making excellent progress right now. My expectation is that we will have the replacement named by the end of the fiscal year at the latest. But I am quite optimistic that we will be able to announce something quite well before then. So in the interim, I am taking a very hands-on approach with the integration of LT. And I am also relying with a terrific bench of people at ADI across all the facets of the management of the finance function of ADI. So, we can – we are very, very well positioned to ensure that we hit our targets in terms of the ongoing operation as well as the synergies. So, synergies are on track and we will update you on where we are at the Investor Day in the latter part of June here. Chris Danely Great. Thanks, guys. Ali Husain Thanks, Chris. Next caller, please. Operator Your next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani Thanks a lot. I guess just a question on the Linear side you have had this under your belt for a few months now. So I am curious when it comes to revenue synergies, where are you guys more focused on to drive revenue synergies, because I would imagine consumer might be the easiest place to get it or the quickest place to get it, but perhaps not the most ideal one for you. So, how do you think about the end markets and revenue synergies as you go forward? Vincent Roche Yes. Well, I think as we have talked about earlier on, the various markets, all of different cycles in terms of uptake, design cycles and adoption cycles. But I think obviously every sector in which we play, including consumer, has an opportunity for ADI to draw Linear Technology power management for additional revenue opportunity and growth. I would say it’s a medium-term to see the effect anyway of leveraging existing products and getting any meaningful revenue growth from those products is probably a 2 to 3-year proposition as we have experienced as well with Hittite. But I think the areas that we will see meaningful growth in the medium-term here will be automotive for sure. I think the communications sector will see a good uptick in the medium-term. Very judiciously as well, we are looking at some consumer opportunities. So obviously, those hit probably sooner than any other sector of the portfolio we manage. And I think industrial is 3 years plus from here. So I think that’s the way to think about the adoption of existing products and new sockets and the effect that we should see on revenue growth here. Ali Husain Did you have a follow-up? Amit Daryanani I do, sir. I guess your consumer guide for July, modest sequential growth. I think last couple of years it’s been triple-digitish kind of number in the July quarter. The delta, do you think it’s due to later product launches in that segment or a change in the content that you guys have or maybe the OEMs that have more comfort around your ability around these products of asking you to do it a little bit later? It seems to be a fairly big delta, which we have seen the last 2 years at least. So, perhaps help us explain what’s driving that? Ali Husain Yes. So, I guess I will take that. I think we answered the question earlier in the call. I think this is definitely something that is, I would say more related to ADI. And we just have our content in various products are very much SKU dependent and we just think we will have a different kind of a mix this year relative to previous years. But I’d say as we progress into 2018, my expectation is that our B2B mix – our B2B markets expand as a percentage of total revenue as a result. Amit Daryanani Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter guys. Vincent Roche Thank you. Operator Your next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Craig Ellis Yes, thanks for taking the question and congratulations on your execution as you get started in the new area with Linear Tech. My question is regarding the synergies for the combined company. It’s clear, Vincent, that the company is quite happy with the way the early combined work is going. The question is does the progress on synergies thus far cause you to think differently about the linearity with which you expect to realize the $150 million in cost gains from the two companies? Vincent Roche No. I think when we have talked about synergies, we have been very clear that we have acquired LT for all its capabilities in terms of technology and customer management channel, channel management, operations and so on to drive revenue synergy over the long-term. But no, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, I am very pleased with the progress that we are making. We have – we had actually executed a lot of the decisions on the $150 million of synergies in advance of combining the companies. And the synergies are well-identified and the actions are in place to get the synergies executed. So my sense is it will take us, during the coming year, to really see the effects of the synergies in our P&L from a cost perspective. And a little bit longer than that I think as I have just been talking about to get the synergies from the cross-selling opportunities. Ali Husain Right, Craig, another follow-up? Craig Ellis Yes. Thanks for that Ali. And I follow-up on an end market, communications Vincent, I think you have mentioned 5G a couple of times and it seems like relative to 4G, the bigger picture is that, that seems to be more on track or maybe pulling in a little bit earlier versus what we had seen with some of the prior interface changes, but with regard to that opportunity, when would ADI expect 5G related infrastructure revenues to start to become a material part of its communications segment? Thank you. Vincent Roche I think your point is well taken. I think originally when we began talking about 5G, we were talking about it being a facet of our business in kind of 2020-plus. It now seems that we are obviously in trials right now with 5G, all the major application areas, all the major customers globally. So my own sense is that we will begin to see, I think a meaningful ramp in revenue in the 2019 kind of area. Maybe it’s a little sooner, maybe it’s a little later, but that’s my sense at this point in time that there is an aggressive pull in at the carrier level as well as the OEMs to make faster progress in deploying 5G. Ali Husain Alright. Craig, thank you. And we will get through our next caller. Operator Your next question is from Tristan Gerra with Baird. Tristan Gerra Hi, good morning. You had mentioned that you recently that you have seen the small cell business finally picking up, what’s your market share in that business, which I am assuming has been fairly small and what type of growth are we looking and what type of revenue contribution can we get in the next say – in the next 12 months to 18 months? Ali Husain Yes. Hi Tristan, let me try and take a crack at that. I am sure Vince would be much more eloquent than I could ever be. But in any event, I would say on the small cell side, it’s been a relatively small contributor to our growth. I guess what we are particularly proud of are our integrated transceiver solutions that are picking up content both on macro base stations and in small cell base stations. So to be perfectly candid with you, we are pretty agnostic as to where these platforms end up. What is really important for ADI is the channel count. And so as long as you got more and more things that are connecting up, we tend to do extremely well when that happens. And so that could be a small cell, that could be a macro base station, but we are doing extremely well in the marketplace. We had another record quarter on top of our record quarter in the prior quarter in our integrated transceiver solutions that are just sucking up a lot of bill of materials and allowing us to gain share in this market. So interestingly you saw our results this quarter. And again it speaks to the diversity of our communications infrastructure market and our business. But our sequential revenue growth was led by wireless infrastructure and our year-over-year growth was led by wireline infrastructure. So you can see the diversity there. The other point I would make is with the addition of Linear Tech, our communications infrastructure business is more diversified than ever. In the past, about two-thirds of our calls business was wireless. At the current time, it’s more like 50-50. So I think we have the full suite of technology and we are pretty agnostic as to form factor. We have got the products and I think really it’s a question of as the market percolates, we are going to do extremely well. Vincent Roche Yes. I think just to add a little bit of color to what Ali has said, small cell is still a small activity from a market perspective. We are very, very well positioned. And I think it will start to accelerate so much during the course of the next 12 months to 18 months and become a more meaningful part of the overall wireless story in communications infrastructure. Ali Husain Alright. So you answered it better than I would. Thanks Tristan, do you have a follow-up? Tristan Gerra Yes, if I could. And thanks for the very useful answer. It looks like your Hittite business has grown fairly significantly since the close, could you provide some color on what’s been driving that growth, has it been share gain, new products or just distribution synergies and the question really relates to how should we look at Linear Tech in terms of the experience that you have gained with Hittite and the revenue growth achievement that you have done with Hittite? Vincent Roche Okay. Well, let me try and unpack. There were a couple of key questions there. I think with Hittite, we knew that the technology was very, very strong. And ADI, one of the big synergies we got from acquiring Hittite was just the channel reach, the customer reach and the channel reach that ADI had, that Hittite didn’t have. So we have been able to leverage that to tremendous effect. We knew that the portfolio products, was very, very strong. So, that’s been a huge help to us. Obviously, we have been able to architect. We have been together now almost 3 years and we have been able to architect some really new creative solutions in areas like aerospace and defense, phased array antenna, for example, these new radar systems that are being deployed as radar systems digitize across the globe. Even in instrumentation where a lot of the high-frequency systems require the combination of mix signal and microwave technology. Obviously, in the automotive sector where all these microwave technologies are being deployed, we are having the combination of ADI and Hittite there has been really, really powerful. So, I think it’s – it was a case of a lot of products that needed a new channel and a lot of re-architecting of customer systems based upon ADI’s signal processing mix signal strength and Hittite’s microwave strength. So what was the second part of that question? Ali Husain How would you leverage that to Linear? Vincent Roche So, leverage to Linear, I think the approach we have on the best of both was also true with Hittite. We tried to figure out how to be patient, understand the world class capabilities that Hittite had in terms of people and technology. And we have taken the very same approach with LTC. LTC is obviously a world class company as well. So just being patient, listening to create something greater than sum of the parts, build a whole new operating system across the company for speed and simplification. That’s what we did with Hittite and that’s what we are doing with LTC x5. Ali Husain Great. Thanks for the question. And we are zooming into the 11 o’clock hour here, so we are going to do our best to get to everybody. In case we can’t, feel free to call our Investor Relations phone at 781-461-3282. So we will continue until 11:00. Next caller please. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. You talked a bit about the trajectory of synergies on OpEx. What about on the $15 million in COGS? Can you give us fueling for how much of that, if any, is embedded in the Q3 guidance or where might we see that by the end of the year and should we expect a different trajectory of capturing those gross margin synergies versus what you are suggesting we should think about for the OpEx side? Ali Husain Yes, I know I’d say on the gross margin side, we are very early in the process. I’d say those are all very much on the comp. I wouldn’t expect to see those in Q3 or Q4 this year. Did you have a follow-up? Stacy Rasgon I did. On the OpEx or just on the cost synergies, in general, it doesn’t sound like you are quite ready to take the target up. But can you give us a feeling given how far you are in the planning phase and which areas have proved maybe easier than you might have thought initially as well as more difficult? And if we were looking for potential upside, where do you think it might be easiest to squeeze more out? Vincent Roche Well, clearly we have been able to reduce the public company cost of the combined company. That’s one of the things that’s been executed pretty much straight away. I think we had talked before as well about an early retirement program that we had put in place at ADI and we begin to see the benefits of that fettering in over the next couple of quarters. But the – and obviously, distribution channel optimization as well that we had talked about before that will start to show benefits to us, I think towards the back end of this year and the early part of the coming year. So, there are just three or four examples of the things that we have already got in play that we will start to see the benefit of. And all the other synergies are identified. And we have got the actions in place and we are now just ready to realize them. Ali Husain Yes. And Stacy, I will just add we have talked about it before, but the EPS accretion in the third quarter is expected to be 15%. And I think if you start baking some of these synergies in the 2018, I think you get a number well north of that. So, we look forward to updating you on the model and any potential updates on the synergy target next month at the Analyst Meeting. Alright. I think we just hit the 11 o’clock hour. So listen, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. A copy of this transcript will be available on our website and all available reconciliations and additional information can also be found on the Quarterly Results section of our Investor Relations site at investor.analog.com.

My name is Crystal, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I\'d like to welcome everyone to ADP\'s Third Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded, and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Christian Greyenbuhl - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. This is Christian Greyenbuhl, ADP\'s Vice President, Investor Relations. I\'m here today with Carlos Rodriguez, ADP\'s President and Chief Executive Officer, and Jan Siegmund, ADP\'s Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2017 earnings call and webcast. During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their comparable GAAP measures is included in our earnings release and in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. I\'d like to remind everyone that today\'s call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current excitations. Now, let me turn the call over to Carlos. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you, Christian, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. We appreciate your interest in ADP. Today, we released our third quarter fiscal 2017 results, with reported revenue growth of 5% to $3.4 billion. This revenue growth includes about 1 percentage point of pressure from the second quarter disposition of our spending accounts in COBRA businesses. Our diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31. Jan will take you through the key contributing factors to our performance in more detail shortly. Our new business bookings this quarter declined by 7%, as we continued to overcome the strong fiscal 2016 sales of solutions that assist our clients in complying with the Affordable Care Act. I\'d like to remind you that the Affordable Care Act factor was quite unique and that it helped accelerate various buying decisions across our mid- and upmarkets, both from new client share and our existing base. Nevertheless, our pipeline of HCM opportunities continues to be strong, as we leverage our investments in our strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now. Now, let me discuss client retention. As we reported, retention declined 170 basis points for the quarter. The losses that contributed to this decline were concentrated on our legacy platforms, and we believe some of these losses were triggered by our upgrade activities in the mid- and upmarket. We maintain our core belief that these migrations are the right thing to do for our clients as well as for ADP. Our midmarket migrations are anticipated to be completed by the end of this calendar year, while the migration efforts upmarket will be phased in over time in partnership with our clients. Client satisfaction and retention remains high on our strategic platforms, and we are seeing that with our midmarket Workforce Now platform. The feedback from clients on this platform has been positive. In fact, a report from G2 Crowd, a leading business solutions review platform, recently added ADP Workforce Now to its Best Software 2017 list in the Core HR category. This list is based exclusively on feedback from users of the product. We ranked highest for ease-of-use, quality of support, which is especially gratifying given our focus on service and the user experience. ADP\'s success over the past 68 years is tied to our ability to keep pace with our clients\' evolving needs across economic cycles. As our recent workforce vitality report indicated, the labor market continues to be robust, and we see our clients becoming increasingly focused on talent, finding, retaining and engaging critical staff in a much more competitive environment. Our recent acquisition of the Marcus Buckingham Company, which we completed in the third quarter, is an example of our commitment to assist clients in meeting their talent needs. When it comes to talent and performance management, we know the needs of each client and each team are unique. By adding TMBC\'s content, coaching and technology solutions to the ADP portfolio, we now offer a suite of proven products to help leaders unleash the talent of their teams and create value for our clients. We\'ve talked before about our focus on the user experience and delivering solutions that our clients and their employees find easier and more intuitive to use. We\'ve applied that same thinking to our channel partners with the introduction of ADP Accountant Connect. We\'re particularly proud of the continued strength and robust growth of our downmarket, where we now have over 500,000 clients on our RUN platform. And this unique solution provides our accountant channel partners with a unified view of payroll as well as reporting and tax information for all our shared clients. This solution was developed in collaboration with our accountant channel partners to meet their needs and has already been recognized by Accountant Today (sic) [Accounting Today] (5:41) as one its 2017 top new products in the accountant resources category. We believe solutions like ADP Accountant Connect will help further enhance our relationships with this important referral channel while creating a better experience for our shared clients. We are also pleased to recently receive recognition from NelsonHall, a global BPO analyst firm, who identified ADP as a leader in payroll services for the fourth consecutive year. In naming us a leader, the NelsonHall report highlighted our global reach and the breadth of our service offering, allowing clients ranging from small businesses to global enterprises to choose how much expertise they wish to retain in-house or to outsource. In its report, NelsonHall also recognized ADP\'s ability to help clients benchmark their workforce metrics against industry averages using the ADP data cloud. And they also recognize the ADP Marketplace, which helps clients access an ecosystem of enterprise applications from ADP and our partners to extend the value of their HCM solutions. It\'s great to be recognized in the industry, but it\'s also great when we see our company recognized more broadly, which is why I was especially proud to see Fortune magazine name us to their Most Admired Companies\' list for the 11th time and rank us number one in our category for the fifth straight time. I\'m particularly proud of this because it\'s a testament to the confidence our stakeholders place in us and to the continued dedication of our 57,000 associates. In closing, despite the pressure on new business bookings and retention, we remain confident in the enduring qualities of our business. We are pleased with the continued strong performance of our PEO and multinational solutions and with our improving service metrics within the midmarket. We are especially pleased with our success in the downmarket, which continues to demonstrate the value of our strategy to deliver great technology and great service. We are confident that this strategy is the right one to help our clients succeed, which will in turn drive sustained growth for ADP. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Jan for further review of our third quarter results and an update on the fiscal 2017 outlook. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you very much, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. ADP revenues for the quarter grew 5% on a reported basis, 6% organic. Our revenue growth this quarter experienced pressure as we began to lap our fiscal year 2016 ACA-related revenues. Pre-tax earnings from continuing operations before taxes grew 4% on a reported basis to $828 million, despite almost 2 percentage points of combined pressure from our second quarter business disposition and our fiscal year 2017 acquisitions. Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes or adjusted EBIT grew 4%. Adjusted EBIT margin decreased about 20 basis points, compared to 24.8% in last year\'s third quarter. Our margins this quarter were impacted by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations cost related to our service alignment initiative. Our net earnings grew 10% on a reported basis to $588 million and benefited from a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate this quarter was aided by an incremental tax benefit related to prior period software development efforts, $0.04 of which was not previously anticipated and $0.02 tax benefit related to the adoption of new stock-based compensation accounting guidance. Diluted earnings per share grew 12% to $1.31 and benefited from fewer shares outstanding compared with a year ago. Our new business bookings performance this quarter was disappointing. However, we have continued to make investments into our sales organization to better position us for growth. We\'re confident in the competitiveness of our portfolio and the strength of our distribution capabilities, and in turn, our ability to execute on our pipeline of market opportunities. In our Employer Services segment, revenues grew 2% on a reported basis for the quarter and included 1 percentage points of pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses earlier this fiscal year. Our same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.5% in the third quarter. Average client fund balances grew 2% on a reported basis, or 3% on a constant dollar basis compared to a year ago. As a result of improving employment, we have continued to see pressure from lower state unemployment insurance collections impact client fund balances. This pressure was offset by a combination of wage inflation and growth in our pays per control metric. Employer Services margin decreased about 40 basis points in the quarter. This decrease was driven by slower revenue growth as we maintain our investments and product sales and service, including dual operations related to our service alignment initiative. PEO revenues grew 12% in the quarter with average worksite employees growing 12% to 471,000. The PEO continued to experience slowing growth in the benefit pass-through costs, resulting from lower health care renewal premiums, which outweighed growth from higher benefit plan participation of our worksite employees during the quarter. The PEO margins continued to expand through operational efficiencies, which helped drive approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. New business bookings this quarter were down 7%. And as a result, we now expect new business bookings for fiscal year 2017 to decline about 5% to 7% compared to the $1.75 billion sold in fiscal year 2016. We have also updated certain other elements of our fiscal 2017 forecast, which I will now take you through. Despite our revised new business bookings guidance and this quarter\'s revenue retention decline, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at about 6%. This forecast continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. While Employer Services segment consistent with our prior forecast, revenue growth is anticipated to be 3% to 4%, which continues to include 1 percentage point of combined pressure from the sale of our CHSA and COBRA businesses and the impacts from foreign currency. For the PEO, ADP continues to anticipate revenue growth of 13%. We continue to expect our consolidated adjusted EBIT margin expansion to be about 50 basis points, which includes about 20 basis points of pressure from dual operations pertaining to our service alignment initiative, which was not part of our non-GAAP charges. On a segment level, we continue to anticipate margin expansion in Employer Services of 25 basis points to 50 basis points. For the PEO, we expect continued operating efficiencies and slower growth in our pass-through revenues as compared to fiscal year 2016 to help drive margin expansion on a full year basis. Accordingly, we continue to expect fiscal year 2017 PEO margin expansion of at least 100 basis points. We are also now expecting growth in client funds interest revenue to increase to about $20 million compared with our prior forecasted increase of about $15 million. The total impact from the client funds extended investment strategy is now expected to be up about $15 million compared to the prior forecast of about $10 million. The details of this forecast can be found in the supplemental slides on our Investor Relations website. As a result of the software development related tax benefit, some of which was not previously contemplated in our prior guidance and the additional benefit related to the stock-based compensation accounting change, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be 31.4% as compared to our prior forecasted rate of 32.4%. Based upon our revision of our effective tax rate guidance; adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow 13% to 14% compared to our prior forecast of 11% to 13%. Our forecast also continues to contemplate a return of excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1. 4 billion, subject to market conditions during fiscal year 2017. This forecast includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans. So, with that, I will turn the call back to our operator to take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.

We will take our first question from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Thank you. Good morning. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good morning. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Last quarter – I\'m thinking of it as the December quarter – you showed an improvement in client retention, I believe, 10 basis points; in this quarter, the March quarter, down 170 basis points. What was the major change between the December quarter and the March quarter that led to that decline in client revenue retention? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think as we mentioned, I think, in our opening comments, it was concentrated in our legacy platforms in the midmarket and in the upmarket. It was particularly skewed towards the upmarket this quarter. Some of the losses, as you know, we don\'t provide guidance. And in the December quarter, we wouldn\'t have talked about forward-looking retention. But some of the deterioration that we experienced in the quarter was anticipated as a result of some known large losses. We typically have reasonable amount of visibility, sometimes several quarters, if not a year or more, for very large clients when they are moving off of one of our solutions. But I guess the core message we are trying to deliver in our comments is that it continues to be concentrated in our legacy platforms. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. And just as a quick follow-up, it would seem that the decline in new bookings this year and some of the pressure on client revenue retention would be more consequential for fiscal 2018 given the way your revenue model works. Can you give us some preliminary thoughts about fiscal 2018 based on the retention trends and the booking trends you\'re seeing in FY 2017? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think you\'re right about the way the math works for our business. And I think that\'s why Jan was very clear in kind of reaffirming our guidance for, obviously, the rest of the year, because we\'re so far into the year that these variations and retention in sales have very low impact on the current next quarter and even maybe one quarter after that. But clearly, going forward, for the next fiscal year, it does roll into the math in terms of that waterfall chart that we\'ve shared with you. As you know, we don\'t provide guidance for fiscal year 2018 until our August call. So we\'re really in the middle of our operating plan process and we\'ll obviously have better information then in terms of how that waterfall chart exactly falls through in terms of the various factors that impact our revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that\'s true. But, David, you\'re mathematically correct that our new business bookings get implemented and turn into revenue after six months approximately and so some of the impact of our lower retention and lower sales will be seen in the revenue growth next year, as you roll it forward. David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC Understood. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Eskelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Just the first one, if I heard you correctly, it sounded like the midmarket client migrations have been pushed out by two quarters. The question, I guess, is why have you pushed that out? And then expanding on that a little bit further, as you\'re starting, it sounds like with the upmarket – how has what you\'ve seen in midmarket colored your expectations and how you are going to approach the upmarket? Thank you. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think, you\'re right about the timing that we were hoping that we would be done. I think our wording was that we would be done somewhere around the end of this fiscal year. And so, now we\'re saying by the end of the calendar year. Realistically, we really don\'t do migrations in November and December because we have year-end and a lot of activities going on. So it\'s really a few months and its a few clients or a few thousand clients, because in the midmarket, we\'re talking about clients in the thousands. And just as a reminder, there were tens of thousands. I think the total number of client migrations was somewhere around 50,000 or 60,000 clients. And so what we\'re talking about is, I would say, a couple of thousand stragglers that we felt, in order to just meet an artificial deadline wasn\'t worth. We learned our lesson, I think, a year-and-a-half ago around when we had to accelerate, in some cases we were forced to accelerate migrations as a result of ACA to get clients on our new platform in order to be able to give them that solution. We learned through that process that you want to really truly upgrade the clients and have them feel that it\'s an upgrade, not a forced march or a negative experience. And so we\'re just focused on making sure that it\'s the right kind of experience and we felt like a couple of thousand clients falling over from one fiscal year to the other is really not that big of a deal in our minds. And I think it\'s the right thing to do. And I think, to answer your question about how that experience colors our approach in the upmarket, again, I think we learned some lessons in terms of making sure that we do things at the proper pace, and that we do it in partnership with our clients. And I think that becomes much more important in the upmarket where it\'s much more complex, and clients have, in many cases, provide a lot of their own internal resources in order to make a migration happen. In the small market, when we did those migrations, there was very little effort and very little need for clients to be involved. In the midmarket, there was a little bit more effort and a little more involvement by the clients. And in the upmarket, there\'s quite a lot of involvement. And hence, it has to be much more carefully planned and, hence, you\'re probably hearing from us that it\'s going to be a longer process in terms of getting those upgrades completed. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. Then just a follow-up, as you\'ve had a little more time in the new service delivery geographies, how was the ability to find talent then? How is it compared to your expectations for shifting to those locations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think it\'s fair to say that we are – and again, we\'re early in our goals here. But really, we\'re on track. So we\'re actually quite pleased. We\'ve got several thousand people already hired in our new locations in Orlando, in Maitland, which is near Orlando; in Norfolk, Virginia; and we\'re already hiring also in Tempe. And it is in addition to Augusta and El Paso where we already had two strategic locations. And we have a couple of other key locations, but those are the ones that we\'ve been talking the most about regarding our strategic alignment initiative. So I\'d say we\'re pleased with the talent, we\'re pleased with the pace. I think we\'re on plan in terms of the number of people we were intending to hire. We\'re on plan in terms of the wage levels and the quality of the talent. I have obviously visited, and I think Jan, we\'ve all visited these locations. In fact, we had a very large associate town hall meeting in our Norfolk, Virginia location. And it may be a honeymoon phase but it\'s an incredibly energetic environment. People are very positive and very bullish on ADP. I think we\'re considered a great employer in the markets that we are entering. And we\'ve got a lot of help from other parts of the organization getting these folks trained and ready to be able to actually deliver service, and in some cases they obviously already are. And that\'s why we have some of these dual operations cost that Jan has referred to a couple of times, because we\'re trying to make sure that we do this in a very careful and methodical way. Rick M. Eskelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning. Thanks as always for all the disclosure. Just a couple of questions. Just on the pricing front, on successfully migrating clients to the new strategic platforms, any surprises there? Did that contribute at all to the bookings forecast? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just to be clear, when we migrate our clients, the migration itself is not counting as a new business booking because business bookings account only incremental recurring revenue that we report. So the migration is generally cost-neutral to our clients, and they have enhanced feature functionality with a new product that they get. In the process, clients continue to make buying decisions and buy incremental modules as they do, and we have seen that trend continue in particular in the midmarket. But the actual migration is revenue-neutral, as we approach it, and that will be the same for all upmarket clients. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah. Thanks for that clarification. I wasn\'t sure if the change might get captured in the (24:26) business bookings. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. So the change – if a client buys more, I don\'t have the most recent statistics here, but I think the trends continue that a number of clients purchases incremental modules as they see the power of the integrated platform. And so there is some slight revenue uptick that we do see for the clients who choose it and only that incremental revenue would be reflected. But it would be immaterial for the new business bookings number in total. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. One more quick follow-up. I know Jan because you\'ve been sort of, I guess, signaling or suggesting that some of these things could happen with ACA. But I\'m just curious, just looking back now, is some of the reduction in this bookings outlook – is there a way to quantify how much might be related to the weak follow-through on ACA module sales and the related tough comp on ACA modules versus maybe a pull-forward of broader payroll HCM sales related to ACA? Do you follow my question? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I do. And I think that it is – as I think we\'ve been trying to signal for, I think, probably three years if you go back to my notes, it\'s very hard because we\'re obviously in uncharted territories, because we were in something completely new. And it was a very comprehensive regulatory framework that required a lot of information from HR platforms, payroll platforms, benefit platforms, et cetera. And when you look back, we had two years of more than 12% new business bookings growth. And this is why we were cautious all along because that is a little strong. We were happy with it and we take it. It\'s good for our shareholders. It\'s good for ADP. It\'s good for our revenues. But it definitely felt like a fairly significant tailwind. And I think, in hindsight, it was obviously a big tailwind. Now, what has now added, I think, potentially to that pressure, which again we can\'t quantify scientifically is that we have, I think, a different environment politically that\'s creating some uncertainty, that certainly has impacted our new business bookings. We just can\'t put our finger on exactly to what extent. So as an example, we knew we had a grow-over issue just for ACA itself because we had already sold 50% of our addressable client base. But we did have some planned sales of ACA this year. And even though we\'ve gotten some, it\'s significantly lower than plan, which is not surprising given the headlines and the frequent votes on repeal and replace of ACA. And so I think that\'s a second factor that I think was not certainly anticipated as we entered into this fiscal year in terms of our planning process. We knew we had to grow over the mathematical grow-over issue. Now we have what I would call the political issue. And then the third one that you mentioned, which again, is very hard for us to put our finger on, but I think you\'re onto something because we experienced the same thing back when we had the Y2K phenomenon in year 2000, where you do have some amount of pull forward, if you will, of business because we\'ve seen this particularly on some of our wins last year from ERPs were quite high and elevated. And I think some of that, it appears, with the benefit of hindsight is, people on kind of older legacy technology trying to find a new solution for ACA. And by the way, some of that happened to us. So as we mentioned, before we think some of our retention issues last year may have been related to the same factor of people kind of just out looking for new solutions as a result of what I would call an event, which is a significant event called ACA. So I think all three things are a factor. We really wish we could put our finger on exactly how much each one is accountable. But unfortunately, we can\'t. Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC Got it. Thanks so much for the insights. It\'s helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow-up on the prior question. On the new bookings weakness you\'re seeing and specifically the revision to guidance. Obviously, going from flat to down 5% for the full year. I think you had talked the last quarter about seeing confidence in improving bookings rates as you head through the end of the year. I guess, maybe you could talk anecdotally about what changed from three months ago to today in terms of specific client conversations you\'re having, is it simply the regulatory environment, uncertainty, seizing things up in terms of purchasing decisions? And then if you got any color on what clients are telling you about what they have to see to get more confidence to book? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think that a couple of comments and maybe Jan can add in terms of his observations. We\'ve obviously been meeting frequently with our sales leaders, and I\'ve been going around sales meetings trying to get to put my finger on the pulse. And it doesn\'t appear that it\'s the economy, because we have very robust and strong results in our downmarket. Our PEO is still doing well. Our MNC business had a great quarter. A lot of the channels that we sell through small business like our Insurance Services products and our Retirement Services products are also doing quite well. So it\'s really not an across-the-board weakness. It does appear to be concentrated in places where we had the ACA phenomenon, if you will. And then how much of it is related to just the grow-over itself versus uncertainty about the political environment, and the fact that the people maybe are sitting and waiting. We do have some information around our pipeline, which is not the same as bookings. So bookings are bookings, and we are very clear about how we count revenues. And I think Jan just went through the math. But we do have pipeline reports like any sales force would have pipeline reports. And in our midmarket and our upmarket, we feel pretty good like we did last quarter about our pipeline. So if we say we feel pretty good and the sales are not materializing, that can only lead to only one conclusion, which is the decision-making is getting elongated or slowing. And we can\'t quite put our finger on why, but that\'s exactly the math is showing versus our pipeline right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think the only thing, Jim, just keep in mind our new guidance is down 5% to 7%, is our expected new business bookings guidance and I think Carlos captured it. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Understand. And then maybe as a follow-up. Can you maybe just talk about the regulatory environment changes and what impact that could have on the PEO business? And specifically, what\'s your confidence level in that PEO business kind of sustaining double-digit growth for the foreseeable future? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Good question. Actually, let me finish also. I think you mentioned about like tone in the sales force. And one of the kind of surprising things for me at least is the tone in the sales force is still very positive. Like, we\'ve done some things to try to "encourage people not to throw in the towel" because this is another factor that I have to worry about, right, that we are close to our end of our fiscal year, and the way our incentive systems work, there\'s a big incentive when you\'re exceeding plan to over exceed it. And, likewise, there\'s a bit of an incentive to throw in the towel, if you will, if you\'re having a bad year. So we\'ve done some things to try to – and that may be why the sales forces still remains upbeat, or maybe because they think these issues are transitory. It\'s very, again, hard to put a scientific answer on it. But it feels positive in terms of the tone in the sales force. On the question about PEO and the regulatory environment, I think I mentioned multiple times also in the PEO over the last couple of years that it felt like we were getting some tailwind as a result of ACA, if for no other reason because it was creating conversation opportunities, right. Because people are looking for a solution and they\'re looking at maybe different alternatives and someone is able to talk to them about the PEO, and I think it\'s compelling value proposition they\'re able to close the business. So I would put the PEO in the same category that we were watching, if you will. It\'s not quite the same in the sense that many of the clients in the PEO are not necessarily buying only ACA. And we\'re not rushing to make a decision of that magnitude only because of ACA. So I think there\'s a subtle but important difference. So I\'m not convinced and we certainly aren\'t seeing it in the numbers yet that the PEO will have the same kind of difficulties, if you will, growing over. But it\'s definitely a more difficult sales environment for the PEO. But having said that, just again we\'ve said this multiple times that the PEO has grown double-digits for, I think, its 17 years now. And so it\'s just a very compelling value proposition. And if, for example, there are changes in the regulatory landscape, some parts of our business may be affected like our direct ACA product, if the entire thing gets repealed and the whole thing goes away, that would not be good news for that part of the business. But, as we know now from what we\'re hearing of what\'s growing through Congress, there\'s not going to be a complete repeal. There\'s going to be some kind of new framework. Those types of new frameworks are always good for the PEO because they intend to be more state-based regulation, which is what the PEO is really good at and what small companies are not very good at in having to deal with. And so I think that I would remain generally optimistic and positive – more optimistic and more positive about the PEO. James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from James Berkley from Barclays. Your line is open. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first, just wanted to start off, I know you just touched on this a little bit, but a little more color would be helpful. I mean, I understand why businesses are holding off with regards to ACA solutions, just given the uncertainties that you mentioned around healthcare in the U.S. as a whole. But at the end of the day, the law is the law, right. So kind of like at what point, if reform keeps being delayed, do you think employers will start to demand the solutions you\'re offering around ACA and just make other buying decisions in general that they may have been holding off because of the uncertainty? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. We were hoping that that would happen two weeks ago or three weeks ago when President said that he was done with it and that we\'re moving on to tax reform. And unfortunately, that was not – it appears not to have been the case. So I think we\'re watching the same news you\'re watching. We do have obviously some access to and some information that we get from people in Washington about what\'s happening on the Hill and the regulation and so forth. But we have kind of similar information to what everyone else has. And these things always, when you\'re in the middle of them, feel like your feet are in cement. And that\'s how it feels like to us right now. It\'s very frustrating but these things pass. We will look back a year or two from now and there will either be the existing ACA or some other version or some more complicated state regime or complex regulatory framework at the state level. And we\'ll hopefully be looking back and seeing this as yet another opportunity for ADP to shine and to help our clients. But right now, it is what it is, and it doesn\'t feel great. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And then just to follow up, when you think about the slide that you guys put out, just your long-term growth driver, the 7% to 9% that you think of the longer term and I think you have like a 14% to 15% new business bookings and 7% to 8% reduction from client losses. Just how does that math change given the bookings guidance that you\'re seeing right now? And I know 2018 is a little early, but just any color you can give us on how to think about how that 7% to 9% growth might be impacted for fiscal 2018? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. Our longer-term expectations for organic growth is 7% to 9%, as you correctly quoted. And it\'s driven by growth of new business bookings in the range of 8% to 10% growth. And it always was meant to cover multiple year type of cycle elongated and it was not a commitment obviously, as you see realistically – not a commitment to perform every single fiscal year. So we are not updating our long-term growth outlook at this point in time. But, clearly, our new business bookings have fallen a little bit behind, but relative to a three- or four-year cycle of new business bookings, we still feel good about our growth opportunities. James Robert Berkley - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Danyal Hussain from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thanks. I just want to understand the bookings a little bit more. So a two-part question, part math, part more subjective. So the math is just to get the full-year guidance. Seems like you\'re implying potentially further deterioration in the fourth quarter, unless maybe the weighting from the third quarter is disproportionate, so maybe some clarification there. And then the second part of that is maybe you can just talk about the cadence exiting the selling season and into April? Carlos, you already talked a little bit about hoping to see some change as of two weeks ago but not seeing it but maybe just a little bit more color. Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think you\'re right that the third quarter is disproportionate. So we have a lot of – disproportionate number of dollar sales in the third quarter compared to the entire year. And that\'s just the way the seasonality has always worked. So the fourth quarter would not be materially different in terms of the momentum or this kind of the 5% to 7% down range. It\'s in that ballpark. So there is really no real news I think there. I think the cadence in terms of the exit for the – the one thing that we\'re grappling with is, obviously, we have the realities, right, of the political environment and we\'re hoping that there will be resolution here relatively soon. Our fiscal year, obviously, starts on July 1. We\'re hoping to have some kind of – we thought two, three weeks ago, we had clarity. So we\'re hoping that we get that behind us and we get some clarity, because we have lots of other products. We have lots of other parts of our business that are performing well. And we just want to get on with it, right, and be able to continue to sell the other suite of products that we have available both in the midmarket and also in the upmarket. So I think, as I mentioned before, it feels like exiting the year, our pipelines are robust. It feels like the tone and the confidence in the sales force is high. But the results are the results. And I think Jan and I live in a world of reality, not in the world of make-believe. And so we\'re being cautious and careful, but it\'s hard not to be optimistic because the economy is picking up it feels like. The labor markets are tightening. And we have some very compelling value propositions in that kind of environment where employers now are going to be "engaging" in a war for talent again, which we haven\'t seen. We forget that 10 years ago there was real issue in terms of finding people. And we benefited back then from that kind of environment in terms of our HCM solutions, and we\'re hoping that we\'re entering a period here where all of our solutions, the entire suite becomes very compelling as clients become focused on attracting people and holding onto the people that they have. And we see all kinds of metrics in our own numbers and in the government data around higher voluntary turnover, higher wage growth, lots of signals that the labor markets are tightening. And I think our value propositions are very compelling in that kind of environment. So we just want to get this uncertainty and these delays and this slow decision-making behind us so that we can get on to the business. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe just... Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. ...a little comment to this on the outlook, which Carlos described correctly kind of roughly in line with fourth quarter and the full-year guidance. But we\'ll also continue to put our dollars where our statements are and the investments into the sales force, the incentives that we\'re bringing out to get the sales force ready, and the hiring and preparing for growth in the next year are actually fully underway and have actually to some degree impacted our third quarter and fourth quarter results because we believe we have that opportunity going forward. So we\'re preparing for growth in the future. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. And then just a question on retention. I just wanted to clarify. So it sounded like some of the higher attrition was in the upmarket and was partly related to migration. But at the same time, you\'re taking a more measured pace with your migration relative to what you do with Workforce Now. So just trying to square that and see maybe where any surprises came versus expectations? Thanks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Maybe one is connected to the other and maybe not. Because I think the reality is that the variability and I think we\'re very sensitive now obviously to retention for all the right reasons because we went through a really difficult last year, but we\'ve had variability in our retention forever at ADP because it\'s a different metric than our other metrics and it can be volatile. And as an example, in the upmarket, you can have one or two large clients that can actually move that number – one or two clients in the upmarket that can move the number for the upmarket and for ADP. And you saw a little bit of that in the first quarter where we lost that large government contract and the business that we ended up selling or were in the process of selling that had a material impact on our overall retention for the first quarter. So this wasn\'t one large client like that, but it was a handful of clients. And so our upmarket business is a little less than 20% of our overall revenue, so just to kind of put things in context and it\'s 2,000 to 3,000 clients. And a couple, literally, three, four client losses in a particular quarter can really move the number. So I was just trying to help kind of frame the discussion because at least for now I\'m not ready to conceive that we have a permanent – we don\'t talk about forward guidance on retention, but this is a third quarter issue for now. Danyal Hussain - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. All right. One more on the topic of the day, retention. So the upmarket dynamic you\'re describing, I guess, does feel like it\'s a little bit new. Is there a change in the competitive landscape in the upmarket? Or is there anything you can identify that triggered I guess this handful of clients this quarter? Or is it just somewhat anomalous? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s a good question. And I think that you\'d be generally I think right that despite the fact that we do have volatility across quarters, we have generally not paid a lot of attention to it because over the course of kind of rolling 12 months or even in terms of years, calendar years or even fiscal years, our retention in the upmarket has been pretty stable. I mean it\'s a sticky business. It doesn\'t change a whole lot. So I\'d say this quarter was – I\'d say it\'s fair that it\'s a little bit anomalous. And I think the answer to your other part of question; we don\'t see it as being related to any change in the competitive environment. Now, as always, in two to three years or in two to three quarters, I may be singing a different tune, but we have a lot of data around the reasons for the losses, what platform the losses were on, were they new technology, old technology, and what types of product the client had. And I think when we put all that information together, which Jan and I, obviously, spent a lot of time anticipating this being one of the topics of the day, we\'ve spent a lot of time on this issue and looked at the names of the clients, who they are, what platforms they were on, and we don\'t see any change in the competitive environment. I think we\'ve said before that there isn\'t any one competitor that causes us a majority of our losses, and likewise there isn\'t any one competitor where we take the majority of our business from. It\'s spread out all over the landscape and it remains that way. For some of our competitors that might be different because of their size where they may have a heavy concentration of taking clients from one particular company. In our case, that is not the case. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And maybe a tiny bit of further detail, Lisa, is when we look at our competitive position against this multitude of competitors in the quarter, some competitive positions have improved and some have not. And that is a fairly typical thing we see each of these competitors evolving quarter-by-quarter up and down. So when we say the general competitive dynamic we feel has not changed, it\'s rooted in this analysis, and we see in some cases we have improved and some cases we have not. So it\'s a mixed bag obviously, but we believe it hasn\'t changed. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. I think I didn\'t maybe answer directly your question about how does this square with our upgrade or migrations strategy. And I think the things really are somewhat connected in maybe an odd way that we think that because we know what clients we lost and what platforms they were on that it makes it even more compelling for us to move our clients onto our newer technologies. On the other hand, we know that these movements are complex and that the clients need to help us and they need to be involved, they need to cooperate. And so finding the right clients in the right place at the right time is just different than it was in the midmarket and in the down market. But it think it heightens our confidence that it\'s the right thing to do over time. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. And then I guess the follow-up, as we\'ve been living with you through the Workforce Now migrations in the midmarket, I know you\'ve consistently said that the retention levels are higher on the migrated clients and so there\'s sort of this nirvana we are going to get to when the migrations are done where retention should naturally go back up. Are we though now facing a more protracted period in the upmarket kind of going to the same thing? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the nirvana, it does from what Jan and I were looking at just over the last couple of days, their retention rates on our current version Workforce Now strategic platform are extremely high, and we\'re very happy with them and we have a lot of volume on it already. So that feels like it worked out the way we had hoped and we had anticipated. And with now the down-market on our new strategic platform with potential rates that frankly have improved dramatically over the last couple years and with our Workforce Now migrations being completed by the end of this calendar year and with 20% of our base remaining in the upmarket, we\'re feeling good about where we are. But the answer to your question is, yes, we have a protracted migration effort in the upmarket. It\'s the right thing to do. We\'re going to do it, and we\'re going to do it as well as we can and as quickly as we can without causing damage and disruption to our clients. But we\'re in a very different position from where we were four or five years ago when we had 10% of our clients on our strategic platforms that are version-less in cloud where there is no further migration and there is no further disruption. So it\'s a very, very different place and it hasn\'t felt good getting here but it feels pretty good now. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Maybe quickly just on a more positive note. I know you\'ve had the reporting and benchmarking modules out in the market now at least for a few months. How are they doing? How is the uptake? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. It\'s going well. Again, that\'s another one back to the discussion about what\'s happening with the labor markets and the economy in general. Those are products that are useful no matter what, but in the kind of environment that we\'re entering into like helping people make sure that they\'re paying people the right amounts, that they know where their turnover is in comparison to benchmarks, that type of information is very, very useful to an HR leader or to a CEO in making good people decisions on a go-forward basis. So that\'s another example of something that the conversations for the last two or three years were about ACA. I think the conversations for the next two or three years are going to be about what\'s happening with your workforce, what\'s the turnover rate, how are you paying people. And I think these benchmark and analytics tools are going to facilitate those discussions, and hopefully, those sales because those are conversation openers or starters in order to convince clients to come to our product suite, which is I think unique in a sense that it has these data and analytics benchmarks. Lisa Dejong Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Terrific. Thank you. Thanks for all the transparency as usual. Operator Thank you. And our next question will come from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thank you so much. A few times you mentioned the uncertainty and you thought it might have dissipated a few weeks ago when we had a little bit more clarity on ACA. Is the client uncertainty and the elongated decision-making you think it\'s solely related to ACA issues? Are there just other things going on in the current environment that clients are worried about? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Again, I\'ll just say one more time. It\'s impossible for us. We don\'t really have like a chart that kind of follows that. So this is really more on intuition, and I\'ll let Jan comment as well. But it\'s not just ACA that\'s creating uncertainty. I think the administration has asked the Labor Department to review the overtime rules, for example, that were about to be issued. I think there were pay equity rules that were coming out around EEOC reporting that are now under review as well. The fiduciary rule, which was intended to go through the – which would have affected our Retirement Services business has also been put under review. And so I think there are pockets of uncertainty in addition to ACA. And some of them happened to be related to our core business, which is HCM. And so if you\'re selling, for example, an ERP suite, some of that uncertainty may not really affect that decision-making. But if we were involved in a sales process where you had a large hourly workforce and many of them – sorry, a large salaried workforce because of the new rules was going to now be hourly and those hours needed to be tracked and you needed to be in compliance with the FLSA, that sales cycle has probably been elongated as a client stops and goes back to focusing on whatever they were focusing on before that trigger event. So I think there are a few other things that are probably not helpful, but again, it\'s hard for us to put a specific measure on each one of them. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. I understand and I appreciate the color. And then just one, I guess, numbers or model-related question. When do we anniversary the bump in bookings from all the ACA-driven business? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, next fiscal year, we are clearly half – still a little bit of grow-over but not that material. So next year should be a clean year relative to the ACA-related grow-over. Just a further clarification, we have tried to illustrate this a few times. With the ACA core module that we have sold came off an incremental fuller bundled sales that particularly included benefit administration module. So the impact of the Affordable Care Act have been broader than the direct impact of the ACA-related sales, which makes it a little bit harder to predict. And as a consequence, our clients (54:35) typically provides ADP-wide about 50% of our incremental new business bookings, however, come from selling more to existing clients. And that dynamic has now changed because we have fuller bundles now in particular in the midmarket. And so we started to transition to drive new logo growth in the midmarket and those channels have to readjust a little bit as a consequence of the ACA surge that has driven a more complete bundle in particular in the midmarket. So that transition is still present obviously next year, but we feel that we have great strategies in place to replace basically that up-sell strategy with a more aggressive new logo sales. And as we have clarified, it is a disappointing quarter, but despite our down guidance for new business booking sale, it will still be our second highest sales year ever for ADP. So keep that in mind. Jeffrey Marc Silber - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital. Your line is open. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, guys. This is actually Jay Hanna on for Gary today. Kind of going off that last comment, going forward, given the struggles with the client retention this quarter and the now expected decline in bookings, should we expect an even greater spend on sales force additions going forward? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, it\'s funny you should mention that, because I think Jan I think did address and I\'ll let him if he wants to give more detail, which we probably don\'t because we\'re not giving FY 2018 guidance yet. But we\'re definitely not taking our foot off of the accelerator. So we obviously could change our minds a quarter or two from now, but our position right now is I think we mentioned it in Jan\'s comments, we\'re maintaining our investments in service, implementation, et cetera. And in some cases we\'ve actually accelerated or increased some of our investments. And I think in the sales organization is a place where I would say we\'ve added expense. And the irony is that the underlying sales expense gets helped by weaker sales because our commissions are lower and so forth, but there\'s a lot of things that go into that sales expense bucket, including head count cost and commissions. And so it\'s safe to say that our commission expense and our variable expense is helping us from a cost standpoint. But instead of taking that all to the bottom line, we have chosen to invest because, again, we believe our story which is that nothing fundamentally has changed in the economy, which is typically what really affects ADP, which by the way affects us less than most because of the nature of our business model. But if we saw a recession coming or a slowdown coming, we would have to start thinking hard about our expense levels. And that\'s not where we are right now. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a quick reminder, as one of the advantages of ADP is that we serve such a broad range of segments and markets in the U.S. and globally and multinational, and so as we had our challenges in the mid and upmarket, we continue to perform tremendously in the down-market, in the PEO, multinational. So there\'s a broad range of products that are gaining share and really driving success. So obviously, in that balance, our investments into sales signal our confidence for ultimate success in distribution. Jay Hanna - RBC Capital Markets LLC Great. That makes sense. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Couple of product-related questions. With regards to the higher ratings in terms of the G2 for Workforce Now, at what point do you start pivoting from migration of existing clients to proactively selling Workforce Now to clients that aren\'t currently utilizing ADP at all in the midmarket? That\'s the first question. And then secondly, can you tell us where we are with regards to Vantage in terms of the optimization of that solution, and when you would feel really good about pushing that? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I think the answer on the Workforce Now question is, about three or four months ago because I think Jan just alluded to that that we\'ve kind of tilted our focus now more towards new logo growth and new share from kind of the traditional approach of – doesn\'t mean we won\'t take additional modules and incremental business. But this is a fairly significant change from a sales force mentality standpoint where we were for several years focused on upgrades and on incremental sales of other modules to the existing client base as we upgraded them combined with selling something called ACA, which to some extent was a significant tailwind. So we\'re moving into a different environment. Luckily, we have other tailwinds like great products like you just mentioned with Workforce Now, and we can see, for example, our client satisfaction scores improving. We can see our client retention scores on our strategic platform being very, very high, higher than we\'ve had overall for the midmarket historically. So there\'s a lot of positive signs that we want to step on the accelerator and proactively sell our solution just as you mentioned. And I think we kind of got that religion, if you will, I don\'t know four to six months ago. And we\'ve been retooling, right, in terms of – I think Jan alluded to channels. I think if we\'re going to go after incremental new logos, not just add-on business that requires channel partnerships. And I think there\'s a lot of effort underway to build the same kind of success we have in our downmarket now with our midmarket channel partners. And so, the answer is, we\'re on that and we believe that, that will get traction over time. On the question about Vantage, Vantage continues to do quite well. And there, again, our satisfaction scores, for implementation have improved dramatically over the last several quarters as we invested in that process of the implementation process. I think we have like almost 350 live clients, versus I think we were at 220 at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have I think 500 sold, so we have a decent pipeline that needs to be implemented. And I don\'t mean pipeline. Those are actually signed contracts, 500 signed contracts. And so, we feel pretty good about our Vantage platform. I think it compares really well and competes very well with our upmarket competitors. But you all see the same thing we see. It\'s a very competitive environment in the upmarket and there are a lot of solutions. But we like what we have, and I think we\'re competing very effectively. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. And next a quick follow-up. With regards to the dual service platforms, do you still think that by the end of calendar 2018 you\'ll have completed that transition to the new service platforms? Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. You\'re never complete on operations, Mark, but the majority of our work is actually this fiscal year and next fiscal year. So in next fiscal year I\'d still anticipate some dual ops. We haven\'t determined what that will be specifically, but there is still transitioning happening, but the vast majority relative to those three new locations and the two existing ones should be completed in 2018. But our service strategy is obviously organic and evolving and we\'re going to continue to drive improvements, but 2018 is a big year still for us. Mark S. Marcon - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Just two quick clarifications. Just on the retention. Do we know where these clients are going? Are they bringing it in-house, the service? Just curious. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Yeah. The sources of our business and the sources of our losses is something that we track. And both have very similar dynamics. It\'s a fragmented and there\'s no clear trend to it, and so they go to a variety of different targets. Some in the ERP space, some to our traditional competitors, some to other solutions, so it is a wide range. Some is driven by their M&A activity, moving to on (1:03:41). So the loss reasons and their targets is varied as the sources of our businesses are varied and as a consequence we feel the competitive dynamic has not fundamentally changed as we observe it. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And we did look at that. I happened to look at it last night. I asked for a little more detail in terms of our upmarket losses and unfortunately I didn\'t compare the same "top losses" to last year third quarter top losses, but when we looked at this year\'s third quarter losses, there were a couple that went back in-house. That we\'re using, for example, our COS solution, which is our BPO solution upmarket, and I guess they decided to go back and rebuild internal capabilities and use their internal technology. But I think Jan described it well, because I mean we sound elusive when we give you that answer, but it\'s really all over the board. And maybe that\'s because of our size because again, and just to continue to emphasize some of our competitors would have a different story just because of the differences potentially in terms of size. But in our case, it would almost be easier if we had one specific place or one specific reason, but it\'s not that way, neither in the upmarket nor for ADP overall. So there\'s no discernible pattern across – even in the place where we had the concentration of losses this quarter, we can\'t see discernible pattern. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No, that\'s helpful. And then, the other clarification is just on an environment where you guys are, let\'s say, seeing slower revenue growth. Can you still get operating leverage and increase operating margins? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Well, yes. And that\'s fully our intention. So obviously, it\'s much easier to get operating leverage and margin improvement when you\'re growing revenues faster. But we are who we are. So we know ourselves very well, and we know that we\'re a $12 billion-plus company. And so we are happy with 7% to 9% revenue growth. And it\'s easier to get margin when you\'re at 9%. Like when you back out disposition that we had with that AdvancedMD business, we were almost getting close to 10% revenue growth at one point. Now we\'re excluding, again, the dispositions this year, we\'re probably closer to 7% or so in terms of our revenue growth. And the reality is that it\'s harder. But we\'re a very disciplined company. And so, for example, you can see our head count growth for our own internal resources slowing down slightly, despite the fact that we\'re still investing in our sales organization, because we have lower volumes. And so we know that, we get that. We\'ve been doing this for 68 years. And so we will adjust appropriately because we still want to deliver great service. Retention is the most important thing for us. And so we don\'t want to cut too much or we\'re not cut because this is a matter of slowing the growth of expense, not cutting expense. But we are slowing the growth of expense in certain areas as our revenue growth slows in order to be able to continue to drive operating efficiencies because we believe there\'s still opportunity for that. We have a lot of process improvement initiatives underway across the company because we believe that the complexity that we have historically had, the number of platforms, all the things that we\'ve been telling you about that we\'re trying to simplify, all those things are margin opportunity for us without affecting our associates and without affecting our clients. Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Helpful. Thanks so much for the details. Operator Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi. Your line is open. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you. Hi, Carlos. Hi, Jan. I guess the first question is, if bookings growth recovers or as bookings growth recovers either because of easier comps or other factors, what is the relationship, the impact on the margins I would imagine would be negative. If you can talk about the specific quantification of that relationship, that would be helpful. And the other modeling question I have is with regards to the go forward tax rate? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. So I wish there was an easy answer to the question about margin and sales because back to, again, we want to be intellectually honest here. We had two or three years of very robust plus 12% sales growth, new business bookings growth and we drove margin improvement. So we clearly have the capability to drive margin. And some of that depends on the timing of when the investments and the expense go in. So as I think we\'ve mentioned, we\'ve I would say invested a little bit ahead of 2018 from a sales standpoint. If we had strong new bookings growth next year, there might be some incremental variable cost around commissions and so forth. But I\'m not saying it doesn\'t matter. It clearly matters. The math is very straightforward. But we have a lot of levers in our business and we make choices every day in order to balance our objectives, right? And one of our objectives continues to be margin improvement. But we also have an objective around growth. We have an objective around capital return. And we balance all of those things and I think try to do the right thing for our shareholders and our stakeholders. So I guess, the short answer is, we have the ability, I think, to drive margin when new bookings recover. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. And on the tax rate, Ashwin, this quarter was onetime unanticipated strong outcome relative to our tax strategies of the R&D credits. So this quarter is not a regular quarter, it was a onetime effect and so we\'re going to be returning to our – well, that said, we\'re not giving guidance for next year. But it\'s certainly not going to be at the level that you saw in the third quarter. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Got it. And the third question I have for you Carlos and Jan is really, as you reflect back on how this year sort of transpired and you think about the operating plan for next year, which you\'re in the process of doing. How does that affect, how you go about doing the operating plan, the fact that you\'re considering and so on? If you can kind of walk through the process, what changes, what doesn\'t change? Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. I think that, frankly, the things that we look at and the things we do, many of them, we learn every day. Like, Jan and I are learning every year and every day in our current jobs, and we\'ve learned from our predecessors for many years, and I think this company has a lot of deep experience and knowledge about economic cycles and about how we manage our sales force, et cetera. So we, frankly, would make changes around the edges. But we\'re very consistent in terms of the way we approach things. And so one of our objectives for 2018 is this is the kind of experience and environment that would lead you to be overly conservative. And we want to be very careful about that. And that\'s why we haven\'t "slashed" expenses or sales investment because we just don\'t see the sign that that is the appropriate move right now. And so in a strange way, part of our challenge for 2018 will be to not allow ourselves to become overly conservative because we want to take advantage of the market opportunity that we have in front of us. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. The tenets translate into what you have heard. Our belief that our core strategic platforms need to be funded and need to be innovative. So we have a belief in our core capability to develop those products. And we continue as we had in a prior question, our belief that the service alignment initiative is fundamentally positive for our business outlook going forward. So we need to continue to drive the execution of those core strategic initiatives, and we continue to believe that our sales force has opportunity to execute and we will be funding those appropriately. So those may be the core tenets kind of really executing around the strategy that we have laid out for the last few years, also on 2018 is a fair assumption to make. Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Okay. Thank you guys. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Jan Siegmund - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks. Carlos A. Rodriguez - Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Just a couple of quick closing remarks. Obviously, we acknowledge we had a very challenging quarter. But I think you can also tell from our tone that we still have a lot of confidence in our business model and in our continued ability, not just to grow our business but also to drive operational efficiencies. You probably also can tell that, in particular, I\'m hopeful and optimistic that the continuing labor markets are going to continue to drive value in our HCM solutions for the market. So I think the economic cycle and the tightened labor markets I\'m hoping will help us as we try to reengage our sales growth and our revenue growth. And I think as Jan just mentioned, we\'re going to continue to make the investments in our innovation and simplification efforts because we believe they\'re yielding the right kinds of results. We\'re going to continue to align our service model, so the strategic alignment initiative I think continues to move forward and I think is on plan. And as you also heard, we\'re going to continue to expand our distribution channels because we\'ve shown a historical ability to create opportunities and use our distribution channel to grow the company, which is ultimately our objective. And so with that, I thank you for joining the call and I thank you for your interest in ADP. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference.
