Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. We're in the middle of a very busy season for Apple, and on Thursday of this week, we're holding another event here on the Apple campus. All of us are excited and we think our customers are going to love these latest innovations. Our results for the September quarter were very strong. We generated $46.9 billion in revenue in the quarter, toward the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 38%, at the very top of our range. We sold 45.5 million iPhones, reflecting continued improvement in year-over-year performance compared to the last two quarters, as we forecasted in January. iPhone sales were up year-over-year in 33 of our top 40 markets. As you know, iPhone customers are the most satisfied and loyal customers in the world, and fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before. This is due to the superior customer experience we deliver with our products, and it's something no other company can match. We had a record-setting quarter for Services, with revenue growth accelerating to 24%, reaching $6.3 billion. App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music. In fact, J.D. Power recently announced that Apple Music enjoys the highest customer satisfaction rating in the streaming music market. Earlier this month I visited Japan, where Apple Pay went live yesterday. Japanese customers are already in the habit of making contactless payments where they commute, dine and shop, so we expect a strong response and rapid adoption of Apple Pay. Around the world, we're seeing very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay, which also launched in Russia and New Zealand this month and is coming to Spain in the next few months. Apple Pay transactions were up nearly 500% year-on-year for the September quarter. In fact, we completed more transactions in the month of September than we did across all of fiscal 2015. And with Apple Pay support now built into Safari, hundreds of thousands of websites are bringing Apple Pay to their customers. Our major partners tell us that Apple Pay shows the highest conversion rate of any digital wallet. We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our Services revenue in the last four years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017. As for our newest products, we're thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These are the best iPhones we've ever made, with breakthrough camera systems, immersive stereo speakers, and the best iPhone performance in battery life ever, thanks to the custom-designed Apple A10 Fusion chip. They feature the brightest, most colorful iPhone displays to date and come in gorgeous new finishes. Demand continues to outstrip supply, but we're working very hard to get them into customers' hands as quickly as possible. We're also off to a great start with Apple Watch Series 2, the next generation of the world's most popular smartwatch, packed with new features including built-in GPS, water resistance, a dramatically brighter display and a powerful dual-core processor. Individuals and businesses alike are recognizing the potential of Apple Watch to help people stay healthy, motivated and connected. One recent example is Aetna, which has announced a new initiative to revolutionize its members' health experience by subsidizing Apple Watch for individual customers and select large employers. In addition, Aetna is also providing Apple Watch to nearly 50,000 of its own employees to encourage them to live a healthier day. We've just rolled out new versions of iOS, macOS and watchOS and customers are loving the many great new features including Siri on the Mac, enhanced health and fitness capabilities for Apple Watch and a delightful new way to experience your photos on iOS with a feature we call memories. We've made massive advances in messages, making them more expressive and fun than ever with powerful animations, invisible ink and handwritten notes. We're seeing great offerings from developers in the all new App Store for Messages, and there has been a marked increase in our monthly active users. One of the great new features of iOS 10 is the Home app, which is making home automation easy to set up and intuitive to use. Customers can easily set up and securely control all their HomeKit accessories, from lights and cameras to the garage doors and air conditioners, all from their favorite iOS devices. We expect over 100 HomeKit-compatible products to be on the market by the end of this year, all reviewed and approved by Apple to help ensure customer security when using them. Our Apple stores are wonderful places to discover and learn about these great products for the connected home. With our latest operating systems, machine learning is making our products and services smarter, more intuitive and even more personal. We've been using these technologies for years to create better user experiences, and we've also been investing heavily both through R&D and acquisitions. Today, machine learning drives improvements in countless features across our products. It enables the proactive features in iOS 10, which offers suggestions on which app you might want to use or which context you might want to include in an email. Our camera and photo software uses advanced face recognition to help you take better pictures and object and scene recognition to make them easier to sort and find. Machine learning makes the fitness features of Apple Watch more accurate and even helps extend battery life across our products. Machine learning continually helps Siri get even smarter in areas such as understanding natural language. We've extended Siri to work in many new ways by opening it to developers and most recently by making Siri available to Mac users in Mac OS Sierra. We're already seeing great momentum in just the first few weeks from developers leveraging the Siri and speech APIs and we're very happy with the engagement it's driving with Siri. Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. Reliance Jio is rolling out a a first of its kind all-IP network in India with 4G coverage in 18,000 cities and 200,000 villages across the country. They're offering a free year of service to purchasers of new iPhones and we're partnering with them to ensure great iPhone performance on their network. Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year, and we believe we're just beginning to scratch the surface of this large and growing market opportunity. We're also very happy with the progress of our enterprise market initiatives, which continue to expand. Just last month, we announced a partnership with Deloitte to help companies quickly and easily transform the way they work by maximizing the power, ease of use, and security of the iOS platform. Deloitte is creating a unique Apple practice with over 5,000 strategic advisors focused on helping businesses transform work in functions across the enterprise. We're also collaborating on the development of Enterprise Next, a new Deloitte consulting service designed to help clients across more than 20 industries take full advantage of the iOS ecosystem and quickly develop custom solutions through rapid prototyping. As we close the books on another incredible year, I'd like to thank our talented employees for their hard work and passion for making the best products in the world, our amazing developer community for their relentless creativity and our wonderful customers, business partners and shareholders for their loyalty and support. Now I'll hand it over to Luca to share more details on the September quarter. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $46.9 billion, towards the high end of our guidance range. Our revenue grew very strongly in many emerging markets, including Russia, Turkey, the Middle East, Thailand and Vietnam, and we continue to see solid growth in Japan and in Latin America. Gross margin was 38%, at the top of our guidance range, thanks to favorable cost performance. Operating margin was 25.1% of revenue and net income was $9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.67 and cash flow from operations was $16.1 billion, which is a new record for the September quarter. For details by product, I will start with iPhone. We sold 45.5 million iPhones in the quarter, thanks to the very successful launch of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and continued strong demand for other iPhones. Including 2.7 million iPhones that were in transit at the end of the quarter, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 2.5 million units, and we exited the quarter well below our five to seven week target range of channel inventory. We experienced strong iPhone growth in many markets around the world, including Canada, Latin America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India and South Asia. iPhone sales in Greater China declined during the quarter, but the initial customer response to iPhone 7 and 7 Plus gives us confidence that our December quarter performance in China will be significantly better on a year-over-year basis than our September quarter results, even as we lap the all-time record period from a year ago. Worldwide demand for iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has significantly outpaced supply, particularly on iPhone 7 Plus, and we're working very hard to get the new iPhones into the hands of our customers as quickly as possible. iPhone ASP increased to $619 in the September quarter, which was above our expectations. That's up from $595 in the June quarter when we launched iPhone SE and we had a significant channel inventory reduction. We expect iPhone ASP to increase markedly on a sequential basis to a level similar to our ASP in the December quarter last year. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone remains extremely strong. In the U.S. for instance, the latest survey fielded by 451 Research found that among consumers planning to purchase a smartphone within 90 days, 65% plan to purchase iPhone, with the current iPhone owners reporting a 97% customer satisfaction rating. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the latest survey measured a 95% iPhone customer satisfaction rating and found that of those planning to purchase smartphones in the December quarter, 79% planned to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $6.3 billion in revenue with an increase of 24% over a year ago. The App Store growth rate has now accelerated for five consecutive quarters, reaching 43% in the September quarter. The App Store remains the preferred destination for both customers and developers. According to App Annie, it generated 100% more global revenue than Google Play in the September quarter. In addition to the great performance from apps, we saw strong double-digit revenue growth in several other service categories and Apple Pay transaction volume has grown dramatically, as Tim mentioned. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. We sold 4.9 million Macs, facing a difficult year-over-year compare, given the launch of new Macs in the spring of 2015. Despite this, our Mac installed base reached a new all-time high at the end of the September quarter and we'll have some exciting news to share with current and future Mac owners very soon. We ended the quarter below our four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, revenue was flat compared to last year. iPad ASP was $459, $26 higher than a year ago, with increase driven by the new iPad Pro line. We sold 9.3 million iPads, and we reduced channel inventory by about 80,000 units, exiting the quarter below our five to seven-week target range. We continue to be highly successful both in terms of market share and customer metrics in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad gained share in the U.S. tablet market in the September quarter and had 82% share of tablets priced above $200. And in August, 451 Research measured a 96% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad mini, 95% rate for iPad Air, and a 93% rate for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, 73% plan to purchase an iPad, more than eight times the purchase intention rate of the next highest brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 94% satisfaction rate for iPad and a purchase intent of 68% for the December quarter. In the enterprise market, we are seeing some great examples of iPad and Mac deployment. Our Mobility Partner Program continues to grow stronger, with over 120 partners around the world offering tailored solutions to businesses of all sizes. Revel Systems, a leading iPad point-of-sale solution partner, recently announced a global agreement with Shell retail to implement Revel's iPad based POS system services at 34,000 Shell locations worldwide, including support for Apple Pay in countries where Apple Pay is available. IBM has just released new data on the great results of its Mac rollout. With more employees choosing Mac than ever before, there are now more than 90,000 Macs across the organization in addition to 48,000 iPads and 81,000 iPhones. IBM reports that PCs have three times the cost to manage, drive twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $237.6 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $6.1 billion. $216 billion of this cash or 91% of the total was outside the United States. We issued $7 billion of debt in July, leaving us with $79 billion in term debt at the end of the quarter. We returned over $9 billion to investors during the September quarter as follows. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $3 billion on repurchases of 28.6 million Apple shares through open market transactions, and we launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 22.5 million shares. We also completed our seventh accelerated share repurchase program, with adding an additional 12.3 million shares. So total buyback activity during the quarter reduced our share count by 1.5%. We have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share repurchases. During the September quarter, we also completed four acquisitions and incurred $3.6 billion in capital expenditures. Our total CapEx for the year was $12.8 billion. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, slightly higher than the 25.5% we guided to because of a differential graphic mix of earnings relative to our regional expectations. Our tax rate for the full fiscal year was 25.6% As we move ahead into the December quarter, I would like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $76 billion and $78 billion. This represents a return to growth over the all-time revenue record set in the December quarter a year ago. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.9 billion and $7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2016. With that, I would like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow up. May we have the first question, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator First we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades? And second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment. And I'm curious about the car. There are a lot of rumors out there, and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that demand is very robust. But from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's sort of we are in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win. I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Just one quick follow up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter for iPhone supplies? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please? Operator Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory given all the major products are running below target? Just trying to get at whether you see revenue and in particular iPhone growth year on year on more of a sellout basis when you adjust for those two factors? And then I have a follow up. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes Katy, sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up for the December quarter. Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter. You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra days do help us this quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 90 days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year, so the cadence has moved more towards the Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago. And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC That's great color. Thank you for that. A follow up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history, or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Cross Research, Shannon Cross. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you about the demand in China? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock, and look at the full year of 2016, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the previous year. So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result. Also as you probably know, the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the underlying business performance was 14% down. And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. And so that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference. Now that spun or created another issue for us, because we didn't forecast that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us. And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so with the number of middle class – people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus significantly in China. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions? And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world. And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So I just, if you can give sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray. And yet from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single-digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitor's laying down, you have an enormous, you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward? And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the company? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right, we've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow. You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement. Is that still the case? And then additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content. Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple, or whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around the ecosystem and distribution. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. I have a question for Luca and then one for Tim as well. Luca, I wanted to dig into the Services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumption driven on a per user basis versus the base as a whole? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. The last time we talked about it, it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well, which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products and it's growing of course in total. When you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue has been accelerating during the course of the year during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly. So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. We've got customers that are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our Services business. It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. And then Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence, both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google but also in some of the home assistance, like the Amazon Echo. And you guys have obviously had Siri for a while as well. But I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. And then also how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a balance point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater. In fact, you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a lot of the energy into doing that. In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's sort of like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that at a high level is how we see it. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted ask you about the total deferred revenue which was down about $1.3 billion in June and I think down another $400 million in September. Those are rather large declines, even given the fact that your units are coming down and you had the accounting change back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that and what you might expect going forward? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. And again, I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do? I know you won't tell us what it us, but do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years? Or is it more a read the market and quickly react? And B, do you have any sense that we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we'd call the next job to be done haven't yet aligned? And so maybe in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match what people want to do, but it's not quite here yet? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it. But as usual, we're not going to talk about what's ahead. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC But in terms of your approach I guess to new products, do you have a strong sense of where technology is going and where you're going to play? Or is it still enough up the year that you are willing to react fairly quickly, which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of company you are? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We have a strong sense of where things go and we're very agile to shift as we need to. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20 and you're completely sold out. So clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great trade-off to get the best device out there. So as you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. With the iPhone 7 Plus, we put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. And so we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. And, but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is and so we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so that's how we look at it. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right. And that's something that we need to keep in mind as well. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And Tim, this year we saw carrier incentives come back to force post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus. Two years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn, thereby making the phone even more affordable? Thanks. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that'll happen every two years, I don't know. But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks, Tim. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citi. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a financial question for Luca. Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunity in India. And we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population being so large, can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could at some point be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appears that the legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India? And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going? Thank you very much, gentlemen. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. And the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. And so you have a very, very young population. The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people. And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the kind of infrastructure and the technology to do that. Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments in R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that. So what you've seen, for example in fiscal 2016, you've seen investments in R&D growing at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. And this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and remain efficient. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you, and congratulations and thanks for the details, gentleman. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one for Luca and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower and the Street it was I think 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that people are mis-modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first question. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yeah, Rod, let me give you some detail both on a sequential basis and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from, looking at the last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now and we've launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did, in Q1, we did 40%, around 40%, 40%, 41%, but there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we've got the FX situation, which I mentioned before, which is worth another 60 bps, 70 bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. It is very, very important I think for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we made very good trade-offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over time. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted you to ask you, this question comes up once in a while, but I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large company. It's getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works, it would be great. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. And so we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the company that we know really well. And so that thinking has I think proven out over time and I think been very good for our shareholders. And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Rod. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Okay, thank you.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator First we'll hear from Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey, good afternoon and congratulations. And Tim, now that we're a month in the iPhone 7, are you seeing anything measurable in terms of the growing trend of annual upgrades? And second is, historically in terms of new product categories, you guys have always looked for unique advantage before getting into a segment. And I'm curious about the car. There are a lot of rumors out there, and would like your perspective on how you think about an advantage that Apple could add in the auto space? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. In terms of iPhone 7, Gene, the carriers that had upgrade plans, the information that we have from them is that demand is very robust. But from a worldwide point of view, the truth is that demand is outstripping supply in the vast majority of places, particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus. And so it's sort of we are in a situation at the moment, it's difficult in the early weeks to be able to differentiate. But on an anecdotal basis, it's clear the upgrade programs are a win. I can't speak about rumors, but as you know, we look for ways that we can improve the experience and the customers' experience on different sets of products. And we are always looking at new things, and the car space in general is an area that it's clear that there is a lot of technologies that will either become available or will be able to revolutionize the car experience. And so it's interesting from that point of view, but nothing to, certainly nothing to announce today. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Just one quick follow up in terms of the supply. Do you think we'll be at equilibrium by the end of the quarter for iPhone supplies? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. It's hard to say. I believe that on iPhone 7 we will. On iPhone 7 Plus, I'm not sure. I wouldn't say yes at this point, because the underlying demand looks extremely strong on both products but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch. Eugene Charles Munster - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Gene. Can we have the next question, please? Operator Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Good afternoon. Luca, can you help us understand what's embedded in revenue guidance for the extra week as well as any rebuilding of channel inventory given all the major products are running below target? Just trying to get at whether you see revenue and in particular iPhone growth year on year on more of a sellout basis when you adjust for those two factors? And then I have a follow up. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes Katy, sure. Let me say a few things on the 14th week and revenue up for the December quarter. Keep in mind that December quarter a year ago for us was an all-time quarterly revenue record. We think we can grow this year. As Tim said, the interest from customers on iPhone 7 and 7 Plus is very strong. The strength of our Services business, you've seen we've grown 24% in September. We think we can continue to grow very well into the December quarter. You mentioned the 14th week, and the few extra days do help us this quarter. But I think it's important to keep in mind that there are other factors that go and offset these extra few days. As you know, the launch timing of the new iPhone is different this year. We had the first 90 days of sales this year hit Q4. There were only two days last year, so the cadence has moved more towards the Q4 this year versus Q1 last year. As you know, we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units in the first quarter of 2016. As Tim said, we are very supply constrained on iPhone 7 Plus this year. We're simply more supply constrained this year than we were a year ago. And then keep in mind that there were a couple of things that affect the compare as well, which is the fact that a year ago, we had an award for a patent infringement of $548 million, which is obviously a one-off item that is not going to repeat this year. And also the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter. So I hope that gives you a bit of a sense that when you take into account all these factors, we believe that this is a good guidance for the December quarter. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC That's great color. Thank you for that. A follow up for Tim. What should we read into the fact that R&D has more than doubled over the past three years while sales growth was sort of a fifth of that? Are R&D investments just less efficient than they were in the company's history, or should we think about that as incremental spend for products that haven't yet come to market? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There's clearly some amount of R&D that are on products that today are in the development phase that have not reached the market, and so that's a part of it. And we feel really great about the things that we've got. We've also put a lot of emphasis on our Services business as well and on making the ecosystem even better. And so we're very much, we're confidently investing in the future, and that's the reason you see the R&D spend increasing. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Cross Research, Shannon Cross. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. A couple of questions. The first, Tim, can you talk a bit more about China, just how you're thinking about it, where you're seeing pressure? I know you mentioned that you expect to see a significant rebound during the first quarter, but what are your customers telling you about the demand in China? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah, it's a good question, Shannon. So to sort of back up from our results for the quarter, the 90-day clock, and look at the full year of 2016, we were down 17% compared to the fiscal year 2015 which was up 84% from the previous year. So if you look at 2014 to 2016, the revenue grew 52% and the CAGR was 23%, which is really a pretty good result. Also as you probably know, the fiscal year 2016 performance was hurt by the devaluation of the currency which affected it about 3%, so the underlying business performance was 14% down. And so, why was it down? There's lots of reasons, but the largest one in our view is that when you look at what happened in 2015 in China, we had a surge of upgraders that came into the market for the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, and the upgrade rate increased relatively more in Greater China than elsewhere around the world. And so when that upgrade rate in fiscal year 2016 returned to a more normal upgrade rate, which would be akin to what we saw with the iPhone 5S as a point, it had further to fall. And so that's the main reason in our view that you see a difference. Now that spun or created another issue for us, because we didn't forecast that accurately. So in Q1 of last year, we put in too much channel inventory and had been resetting the channel inventory over the few quarters that came beyond it or came after it. And so those two issues, which really the main one is really the first one and the second one was a symptom of it, are in our views the main issue. Now looking forward, the response to the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus has been very positive. It's very hard to gauge demand, as you know, when you're selling everything you're making. And so we'll find out more through the quarter, but we're confident enough to give you guys guidance that we're returning to growth this quarter, which obviously feels very good for us. And from a longer-term point of view, out of the 90-day clocks and so forth, we are very bullish on China. We continue to see a middle class that is booming there. There might be some sort of a new normal in the economy, but a new normal there is still a good growth rate. And so with the number of middle class – people growing into the middle class and the LTE adoption rate being still fairly low, around 45%, 50% or so, then I think we continue to have a really good opportunity there, and so we continue to focus significantly in China. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC And then can you talk a bit about acquisitions? And I don't mean like the smaller ones that you've done sort of at a normal cadence, but there was clearly a fairly large one announced at least this week in the content world. And especially if you find a way to have repatriation of some of the cash at a low tax rate possibly with the next administration. So I just, if you can give sort of an overall view of how you think about acquisitions that might be a little bit larger than normal. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes. Thank you. I have a question and a follow-up, please. I guess a cynic could say Apple is benefiting from an extra week this quarter and is benefiting from Samsung being in complete disarray. And yet from your guidance, it's unclear that iPhone unit growth will be up or certainly not up more than low single-digits implied from your guidance. And I appreciate some of the issues around channel inventory build and the timing of the launch, but if I just stand back from that and say you have terrific new products, your major competitor's laying down, you have an enormous, you have a significant contribution from an extra week, arguably 7% or 8%, and yet the iPhone growth is sort of flattish, what does that really say about how investors should think about iPhone on a sustained basis growing forward? And is it reasonable to think that this is an ongoing growing business for the company? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Toni, let me take this one. I think you mentioned a number of the things that are affecting us in the December quarter, and I went through them with Katy just a few minutes ago. You're right, we've got an extra few days. You know very well the launch timing is different. You know that we increased iPhone channel inventory by 3.3 million units a year ago. I mentioned two issues that affect us, the one-timer from a year ago that you obviously need to exclude from the compare and the FX that is the reality of our business right now. But maybe the most important element of this is the fact that we are supply constrained on 7 and 7 Plus. And so when you talk about other competitors, it's not particularly relevant to us right now because we are selling everything that we can produce. And so when we look at all these things in its totality, we think that for the total company of course, we believe that revenue's going to grow. You know that we don't get into specific product from a unit standpoint giving guidance, and so we feel very confident about the trajectory for the company and for iPhone going forward. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay. Tim, if I could ask you one, please. You've talked in the past about television being an area of intense interest. I was wondering if you could reaffirm that statement. Is that still the case? And then additionally, given what's happening with acquisitions, how broadly you think about the role of content. Apple has started creating on a very limited scale some of its own content and whether you think content creation and ownership is important to Apple, or whether Apple ultimately sees its place in the value chain as being more around the ecosystem and distribution. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Goldman Sachs, Simona Jankowski. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. I have a question for Luca and then one for Tim as well. Luca, I wanted to dig into the Services business a bit more. As you pointed out, it accelerated again to 24%. How does that compare to the pace of growth of the installed base, just to help us decouple how much of it is consumption driven on a per user basis versus the base as a whole? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Simona, the installed base number is something that we talk about periodically. The last time we talked about it, it was in the January call. It is growing. Our installed base is growing very well, which is very important for us. It's growing on all major products and it's growing of course in total. When you look at our Services revenue, the growth of the Services revenue has been accelerating during the course of the year during a period when, as you know, our revenue came down slightly. So what that means in practice is that what we are seeing with our customers that consume our services is that the people that are actually taking advantage of our services over time tend spend more and more on our services. We've got customers that are very engaged with our products. They're very loyal, and so you see this upward trajectory of our Services business. It's not only with the App Store but there's several categories that are growing very well for us. Tim mentioned Apple Music, but we got other parts of the business that continue to do well, even as I said during a period of time when our sales have come down a bit. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. And then Tim, we've seen an increasing focus on artificial intelligence, both in smartphones like the new Pixel from Google but also in some of the home assistance, like the Amazon Echo. And you guys have obviously had Siri for a while as well. But I just am curious how you think about balancing AI with your focus on privacy. And then also how important it is to have a dedicated home assistant versus just having the phone as the home assistant? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I think to answer your second question first, I think that most people would like an assistant with them all the time. And we live in a mobile society. People are constantly moving from home to work and to other things that they may be doing. And so the advantage of having a assistant on your phone is it's with you all the time. That doesn't say that there is not a nice market for a home one. I'm not making that point. I'm just saying on a balance point of view, I think the usage of one on the phone will likely be much greater. In fact, you can just look at Siri today and this is now accelerating with iOS 10 and the Mac, but we've been getting 2 billion requests a week for Siri. And so it's very large and to the best of our knowledge, we've shipped more assistant enabled devices than probably anyone out there. Our focus is on this worldwide, and so it's not only a U.S. focus, but we want to deliver a great experience around the world and deliver it globally, and so we've put a lot of the energy into doing that. In terms of the balance between privacy and AI, this is a long conversation, but at a high level, I think it's a false trade-off that people would like you to believe that you have to give up privacy in order to have AI do something for you. We don't buy that. It may take a different kind of work. It might take more thinking, but I don't think we should throw our privacy away. It's sort of like the age-old argument about privacy versus security. We should have both. It shouldn't be making a choice. And so that at a high level is how we see it. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted ask you about the total deferred revenue which was down about $1.3 billion in June and I think down another $400 million in September. Those are rather large declines, even given the fact that your units are coming down and you had the accounting change back in September. Could you talk about some of the drivers of that and what you might expect going forward? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Steve, you mentioned by far the largest driver. The largest driver is the fact that we made the change, an accounting change to our ESPs exactly a year ago. So we are lapping the year where you see the effect. I think you're not going to see the same thing going forward. And then we tend to defer some revenue on some other categories, like for example gift cards or some AppleCare, but in general by far the largest element is the change in ESPs. And again, I don't think you're going to see the same impact going forward. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. And then, Tim, some investors are antsy that Apple has not acquired new profit pools or introduced a financially material new product in recent years. The question is, A, does Apple today have a grand strategy for what you want to do? I know you won't tell us what it us, but do you know what you want to do over the next three to maybe five years? Or is it more a read the market and quickly react? And B, do you have any sense that we're kind of in a gap period where the technology and arguably what we'd call the next job to be done haven't yet aligned? And so maybe in a couple years, we will see this flurry of new products and it'll sort of match what people want to do, but it's not quite here yet? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We have the strongest pipeline that we've ever had and we're really confident about the things in it. But as usual, we're not going to talk about what's ahead. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC But in terms of your approach I guess to new products, do you have a strong sense of where technology is going and where you're going to play? Or is it still enough up the year that you are willing to react fairly quickly, which arguably your organization allows you to do for the size of company you are? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We have a strong sense of where things go and we're very agile to shift as we need to. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Steve. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Bank of America, Wamsi Mohan. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Yes. Thank you. So, Tim and Luca, you saw that you could raise the ASP on the iPhone 7 Plus by $20 and you're completely sold out. So clearly this device plays a central role in our lives, so much that owners probably look at that incremental cost as a great trade-off to get the best device out there. So as you see more and more features being added into iPhones, do you conceptually expect that you are anywhere close to the point where raising ASPs further would be net disruptive to demand? Or do you see more rooms to raise ASPs over time as you add incremental features? And I have a follow up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. With the iPhone 7 Plus, we put an incredible amount of innovation into the camera and the overall photo experience, and customers are obviously using that and have discovered that they love it. And so we're getting an incredible amount of feedback there. We also get incredible feedback on the iPhone 7. And, but the mix that we projected on iPhone 7 Plus is short of what the reality is and so we are chasing supply there. In terms of the ASP, the way we think about it is we want to charge a fair price and so we don't want to charge more than that, and we think it's worth being fair. And so that's how we look at it. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. If I can add, Wamsi, keep in mind that in a lot of countries around the world, the reality is that our customers have seen some significant price increases because of the FX situation, right. And that's something that we need to keep in mind as well. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thanks. Thanks for the clarification. And Tim, this year we saw carrier incentives come back to force post the launch of the iPhone 7, 7 Plus. Two years ago there was a giant upgrade to iPhone from the iPhone 6, 6 Plus. Do you think every couple of years we are likely to see carrier incentives come back into play given worries around customer churn, thereby making the phone even more affordable? Thanks. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We clearly saw that this year. There's a lot of competition for customers in the U.S. which I think is the market that you're talking about. Whether that'll happen every two years, I don't know. But I suspect that any time there are large numbers of customers that have a phone that's in that two year kind of range that it tends to be a sweet spot, and I think you probably will see a lot of people trying to recruit those customers. Wamsi Mohan - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks, Tim. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Wamsi. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citi. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you very much. A strategy question for Tim and then more of a financial question for Luca. Tim, you'd mentioned in your prepared comments a little bit about India and we've been doing a lot of work talking about the opportunity in India. And we get a lot of pushback talking about disposable income metrics and lots of things like that, yet the population being so large, can you talk a little bit about, do you see that India could at some point be as big of an opportunity as China? And it appears that the legal rules have kind of prevented you from going in a lot, but it looks like that's changing. Can you just kind of give us a little more clarity on India? And then, Tim, for the clarification questions, is it fair to say that the OpEx has a disproportionate more expense side with the 14th week that we should kind of think of maybe as we go forward, that we shouldn't expect the OpEx to kind of be chugging along at that high rate? Or is it just kind of the rate of investing that you're going? Thank you very much, gentlemen. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah, thanks for the question. I'll let Luca talk about the OpEx piece of it. On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class sort of over the next decade. And the age of the population, if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. And so you have a very, very young population. The smartphone has not done as well in India in general. However, one of the key reasons for that is the infrastructure hasn't been there. But this year or this year and next year, there are enormous investments going in on 4G and we couldn't be more excited about that because it really takes a great network working with iPhone to produce that great experience for people. And so I see a lot of the factors moving in the right direction there. I also think the government is much more focused on the infrastructure and on creating jobs, which is fantastic, because you really need the kind of infrastructure and the technology to do that. Will it be as big as China? I think it's clear that the population of India will exceed China sometime in probably the next decade or so, maybe less than that. I think it will take longer for the GDP to rival it, but that's not critical for us to have a great success there. The truth is, there's going to be a lot of people there and a lot of people in the middle class that will really want a smartphone, and I think we can compete well for some percentage of those. And given our starting point, even though we've been growing a lot, there is a lot of headroom there in our mind, and so we are working very hard to realize that opportunity. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. And, Jim, on OpEx, our approach to OpEx is quite clear and quite simple. We want to continue to invest in the business in all the areas where we think is critical for us to invest. So you see that we make significant investments in R&D. You've seen the growth rates over the last couple of years. We are making important investments in data centers because we want to support our services business. We continue to open retail stores around the world. We continue to invest in marketing and advertising. At the same time, we want to continue to be efficient and lean. It's something that we've done very well over the years and want to continue to do that. So what you've seen, for example in fiscal 2016, you've seen investments in R&D growing at 25% and then our SG&A expenses to be about flat. And this is kind of the approach that we want to take and continue to take going forward. If you step back for a second and you look at our implied guidance for the December quarter, we got an expense to revenue ratio of 9%. This is extremely competitive in our industry and I would say in general. And so we want to continue to have this balance, make the right investments and remain efficient. James D. Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Thank you, and congratulations and thanks for the details, gentleman. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim. Can we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I had one for Luca and then a follow-up for Tim. So, Luca, I wanted to ask about the gross margin guidance. I think that the Street and we were expecting something a little bit higher. And again, that's about 50 basis points lower and the Street it was I think 70 basis points lower. And I'm just curious, do you think that people are mis-modeling that or is there something going on with pricing or mix there that you could provide us more color on? So that's my first question. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yeah, Rod, let me give you some detail both on a sequential basis and I'll give you also something on a year-over-year basis because maybe that's where the disconnect comes from, looking at the last year's gross margins in the December quarter. On a sequential basis, we are essentially guiding to some improvement in gross margins. We had 38% both in the June quarter and in the September quarter. We're guiding slightly higher for the December quarter because on the positive, we're going to have of course better leverage and the mix in the December quarter tends to be better. But we need to keep into account the fact that these positives are going to be partially offset by the cost structures of the new products that we are launching now and we've launched already a few during the September quarter and that will have an impact on our December quarter results. On a year-over-year basis, keep in mind that last year we did, in Q1, we did 40%, around 40%, 40%, 41%, but there's a couple of things that I think need to be considered before doing a year-over-year compare. And it's the fact that last year we had this award for a patent infringement of $548 million. That is, at the gross margin level, is 40 bps. And then we've got the FX situation, which I mentioned before, which is worth another 60 bps, 70 bps. And so you're left with less than 100 basis points deterioration on a year-over-year basis where again, we have the reality of new cost structures into our products. It is very, very important I think for investors to understand that what's happened during the last two years. During the last two years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal and we need to work with that. And I think over the years, we made very good trade-offs and our gross margins have been quite stable over time. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Great. Thanks, Luca. And then, Tim, I wanted you to ask you, this question comes up once in a while, but I just wanted to ask you if you could talk to us a little bit about the arguments on both sides of the dividend question. I mean, Apple seems to be perpetually undervalued. It's a very large company. It's getting harder and harder to grow. Your payout ratio is significantly below the S&P 500. I know you can't tell us what your intentions are here, but if you could help us understand how that thinking around the dividend works, it would be great. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We review the capital return annually, and we've established a cadence now to announce our thinking on that every April. And so we have a robust discussion around the dividend and the buyback. We very much believe that Apple is very undervalued, and so we're investing with confidence in the company that we know really well. And so that thinking has I think proven out over time and I think been very good for our shareholders. And in addition to that, we know that some shareholders really like a dividend and some ongoing income, and so we've provided a amount that we think is a good amount and have a good track record of raising it annually. And so we'll be able to say more on that I'm sure in April of next year. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Rod. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great. Okay, thank you.

Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Nancy, and good afternoon everyone, and thanks very much for joining us. I\'m very happy to share with you the outstanding results of Apple\'s December quarter. We generated the highest quarterly revenue in Apple\'s history along with all-time unit and revenue records for iPhone and Apple Watch, all-time revenue records for Services and Mac, and all-time revenue records for four out of our five geographic segments. The strong performance of our business also produced all-time record earnings per share. Revenue in the quarter was $78.4 billion, which was above the top of our guidance range. iPhone had a tremendous quarter thanks to exceptional demand that beat our own internal expectations. While iPhone 7 is our most popular model, we saw especially strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which was a higher portion of the new product mix than we\'ve ever seen with Plus models in the past. Demand for iPhone 7 Plus exceeded supply throughout the quarter, and we came into supply/demand balance in January. iPhone 7 Plus has earned rave reviews for its advanced new features, especially the dual camera system, which produces stunning portraits and high-quality zoom. This is a uniquely Apple feature that is surprising and delighting our users. Both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are empowering our customers to be more productive, more engaged, and more expressive than ever by integrating hardware, software, and services to create experiences that only Apple can deliver. It was our best quarter ever for Services, with almost $7.2 billion in revenue. App Store customers broke all-time records during the holiday quarter, including $3 billion in purchases in December alone, making it the App Store\'s single best month ever. Our innovative and vibrant developer community has created over 2.2 million apps for doing almost anything that you can imagine. Apple\'s developer community has now earned over $60 billion, including over $20 billion in 2016 alone. Revenue from our music business grew for the third quarter in a row, and our AppleCare and iPlus storage services had all-time record results. Apple Pay continued its strong momentum, with the number of users more than tripling over the past year and hundreds of millions of transactions and billions of dollars in purchases in the December quarter alone. Transaction volume was up over 500% year over year as we expanded to four new countries, including Japan, Russia, New Zealand, and Spain, bringing us into a total of 13 markets. Apple Pay on the Web is delivering our partners great results. Nearly 2 million small businesses are accepting invoice payments with Apply Pay through Intuit QuickBooks Online, FreshBooks, and other billing partners. And beginning this quarter, Comcast customers can pay their monthly bill in a single touch with Apple Pay. Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our Services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next four years. The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever. Our latest data shows that most Mac customers are buying their first Mac, with the vast majority of them coming from a Windows PC. The new MacBook Touch with Touch Bar is an outstanding example of the innovation made possible by integrating world-class hardware and software. We were supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and are just now coming into supply/demand balance. It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn\'t make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn\'t be more excited about Apple Watch. We\'re also thrilled with the response to AirPods. Customers love the magical experience AirPods are delivering. And if you haven\'t tried them yet, you\'ll be delighted when you do. They\'re far ahead of anything else on the market today, and we\'re working hard to catch up with the incredible demand. With AirPods off to a fantastic start, a strong full first year for Apple Watch, and Beats headphones offering a great wireless experience using the Apple-designed W1 chip, we now have a rich lineup of wearable products. Their design, elegance, and ease of use make us very excited about the huge growth potential for wearables going forward. Our ecosystem is broadening to more and more of the areas where people spend their time, at the gym, on the go, in the home, and on the job. For example, every major automaker is committed to supporting CarPlay with over 200 different models announced, including five of the top 10 selling models in the United States. There are well over 1 million people using CarPlay now, and this continues to grow rapidly. And we are leading the industry by being the first to integrate home automation into a major platform with iOS 10. With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch. The number of HomeKit-compatible accessories continues to grow rapidly, with many exciting solutions announced just this month, including video cameras, motion detectors, and sensors for doors, windows, and even water leaks. Perhaps even more importantly, we are unmatched when it comes to securing your home with HomeKit-enabled door locks, garage doors, and alarm systems. I\'m personally using HomeKit accessories and the Home app to integrate iOS into my home routine. Now when I say good morning to Siri, my house lights come on and my coffee starts brewing. When I go to the living room to relax in the evening, I use Siri to adjust the lighting and turn on the fireplace. And when I leave the house, a simple tap on my iPhone turns the lights off, adjusts the thermostat down, and locks the doors. When I return to my house in the evening, as I near my home, the house prepares itself for my arrival automatically by using a simple geofence. This level of home automation was unimaginable just a few years ago, and it\'s here today with iOS and HomeKit. We\'re making great progress in the enterprise market alongside our major partners. The combination of iOS and Cisco technology is giving companies everywhere the opportunity to vastly improve the user experience for their mobile employees. With enhanced networking performance, up to eight times faster roaming, better reliability for apps, and native voice experience, we\'re excited about how much more productive the workforce will be with these great capabilities. In fact, the total number of joint customer opportunities has grown over 70% since last quarter. Enterprises are using IBM\'s new Mobile at Scale design and development model to deploy multiple iOS apps with speed and efficiency. For example, Finnair is transforming aircraft maintenance, and CEMEX is revamping activities from attracting new clients to invoicing to after-sales support. And later this spring, SAP will be rolling out its SDK for iOS, providing its community of more than 2.5 million developers the tools to build powerful native iOS apps that leverage the SAP HANA cloud platform. We\'re delighted with how these partnerships are making it even easier for enterprise customers to transform how work gets done with iOS. As we reflect on a record-breaking December quarter, I\'d like to thank our developers, our business partners, and our employees for their incredible contributions and commitment. And I\'d like to thank all of our customers around the world for their excitement and loyalty, which ultimately drive these results. Now I\'d like to turn it over to Luca to talk about the quarter in more detail. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $78.4 billion, the highest quarterly revenue in the history of Apple and above our guidance range. As Tim mentioned, the strength of our results was very broad-based, as we set new revenue records for iPhone, for Services, for Mac, and for Apple Watch. We also established new all-time revenue records in most developed and emerging markets, with strong growth rates in many countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, India, Turkey, and Russia. We accomplished all this despite a very challenging foreign exchange environment due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. As we had expected, our year-over-year performance in Greater China improved significantly relative to the September quarter. Total Greater China segment revenue was down 12%, but revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago and grew in constant currency terms. In all other geographic segments, we generated all-time quarterly record results. We had the benefit of a 14th week during the quarter this year, but this was offset by four factors. First, this year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago. Second, iPhone 7 launched earlier in the September quarter compared to the iPhone 6s launch the previous year, creating a more difficult comparison for the December quarter this year. Third, the stronger U.S. dollar affected total revenue growth this year by 100 basis points. And fourth, our year-ago revenue included the benefit of a one-off $548 million patent infringement payment. Also, strong customer interest left us in supply/demand imbalance for several of our products throughout the quarter this year. Gross margin was 38.5%, at the high end of our guidance range. Operating margin was 29.8% of revenue, and net income was $17.9 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $3.36, a new all-time record, and cash flow from operations was $27.1 billion. We had a terrific quarter for iPhone as we sold 78.3 million units, a new all-time record and an increase of 5% over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8%. We saw double-digit iPhone growth in the U.S., in Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia, and even stronger growth in many emerging markets, including Brazil, Turkey, Russia, Central and Eastern Europe, and Vietnam. iPhone ASP increased to $695 in the December quarter from $619 in the September quarter, driven by the very strong product mix and the amazing success of iPhone 7 Plus. Despite stronger demand than last year, we added only 1.2 million units of iPhone channel inventory across the quarter, significantly less than the increase of 3.3 million units a year ago. And we exited the quarter near the low end of our 5 to 7-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are exceptional, not only with consumers, but also with business users. In the U.S., for instance, the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 97% customer satisfaction rating among all iPhone owners and a 99% satisfaction rating for owners of iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, the iPhone customer satisfaction rating was 94%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the March quarter, 78% plan to purchase an iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated an all-time record $7.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year. Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago. The App Store continued its impressive run, breaking all previous revenue records. Year-over-year App Store revenue growth was 43% through the first 13 weeks of the quarter. It\'s great to see that both average revenue per paying account and the number of paying accounts grew strongly during the quarter. And according to App Annie\'s latest report, App Store revenue continues to outpace the industry overall, with more than double the revenue of Google Play in calendar 2016. Next I would like to talk about the Mac. We sold 5.4 million Macs and generated our highest-ever quarterly Mac revenue. We were very happy to report double-digit unit growth in several countries, including Japan, Mainland China, India, the Netherlands, and Sweden, as well as in the U.S. education market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our 4 to 5-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 13.1 million units, which was ahead of our expectations. And we posted double-digit growth in both Mainland China and India, as we\'ve expanded distribution channels in those countries and we continue to attract a very high percentage of first-time tablet buyers. We also reduced channel inventory by about 700,000 units as opposed to an increase of 900,000 units last year, and we exited the quarter near the low end of our five to seven-week target range. iPad is incredibly successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete, both in terms of market share and customer metrics. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 85% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in November, 451 Research measured a 94% consumer satisfaction rate for iPad Mini, a 97% rate for iPad Air, and 96% for iPad Pro. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad is more than four times higher than any other brand measured, with iPad Pro once again the top choice for planned purchases. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 66% for the March quarter. In fact, businesses of all sizes are choosing iPad and iPhone to have them reimagine their everyday activities. We\'re seeing strong momentum in sectors such as retail, where iOS solutions are being deployed for everything from product development to logistics to mobile point-of-sale. Companies like Toys "R" Us, Coach, and Kate Spade are using iOS and our mobility partner solutions to dramatically transform their customer and employee experiences. Our retail stores experienced strong double-digit growth in visitors and revenue in the December quarter. And we continued to expand our global presence, with plans to open our first store in Singapore and our second store in Dubai soon. We are continually updating our stores and adding new and exciting outreach programs to educate kids on our products, entertain the community with fresh live music, teach future Swift developers to code, and empower entrepreneurs to start, grow, and evolve their businesses. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $246.1 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $8.5 billion. $230.2 billion of this cash or 94% of the total was outside the United States. We also had $77.1 billion in term debt and $10.5 billion in commercial paper outstanding at quarter end. We returned almost $15 billion to investors during a very busy December quarter for our capital return activities. We paid $3.1 billion in dividends and equivalents. We spent $5 billion on repurchases of 44.3 million Apple shares through open market transactions. And we launched a new $6 billion ASR, resulting in an initial delivery and retirement of 44.8 million shares. We also completed our eighth accelerated share repurchase program, retiring an additional 4.4 million shares. This led to a net diluted share count reduction of 65.3 million shares during the quarter. We\'ve now completed $201 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $144 billion in share repurchases. And we plan to provide investors with our annual update on the capital return program in the spring. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 26%, as expected. And as we move ahead into the March quarter, I\'d like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. This guidance range includes a $1.2 billion year-over-year headwind from foreign exchange. We expect gross margin to be between 38% and 39%. This guidance range includes an 80 basis points sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We expect OpEx to be between $6.5 billion and $6.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $400 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 26%. Also today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend up $0.57 per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2017 to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2017. With that, I\'d like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. And we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the first question, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow-up, thank you. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it\'s more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I\'ve mentioned that we expect – assuming that rates don\'t move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we\'ve got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we\'ll see where we land. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. And, Tim, there\'s a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion-plus of cash that\'s been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you\'ve noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, I am optimistic given what I\'m hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that\'s very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let\'s wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there\'s not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It\'s more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we\'ll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we\'re pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it\'s come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, with our toe in the water, we\'re learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that. Thanks for the question. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We\'ll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How much of that do you think is growth in your installed base versus increased monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those in two separate tranches? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. I think you\'re absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double-digits, and we\'re also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right. So it\'s a combination of the two. Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that\'s why we are excited about the future of the Services business. And that\'s why, as Tim said, we have a goal that – it\'s already become a very large business. It\'s going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up, there has been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what\'s happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you\'re seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah, I\'ll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it\'s an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6%. So it\'s a significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. Underneath that, what we\'ve seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we\'re pleased with. And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it in – I\'m encouraged with the significant improvement, but we\'re not without challenges there. And I wouldn\'t want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I\'ve seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Cross Research, Shannon Cross. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I\'m trying to figure out is I think the number was you\'re going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that\'s your expectation. So what gets you there? I don\'t know, maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies. And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yeah, Shannon, I\'ll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right. And what we like about the App Store is that it\'s truly a global platform. So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously now, by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn\'t have until recently, we\'ve been able to bring our music business back to growth. We\'ve grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We\'ve had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it\'s another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we\'ve explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It\'s much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We\'re also opening up several new markets because we are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it\'s easier particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate our Services business tends to have margins that are above company average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles, also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that drives different margin percentages. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you. And then my follow-up is just in terms of the elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were basically not able to – you weren\'t you\'re getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I\'m just curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you seeing, and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we\'re talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I\'ve mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it\'s incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn\'t help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Moving on, we\'ll hear from Brian White with Drexel. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC Luca, I\'m wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range. It looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter, please? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn\'t help us on that front. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC Okay. And, Tim, I didn\'t hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. That\'s a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It\'s still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it\'s a great move, and I feel really good about how we\'re doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it\'s a great place to be. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Goldman Sachs, we\'ll hear from Simona Jankowski. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Simona, it\'s Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we\'ve seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it\'s the highest that we\'ve seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it\'s similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk – I share all this with you for transparency\'s sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it\'s difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you, and then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you\'re going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus, I\'m curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. That\'s a big question, and I don\'t have the answer in front of me. If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we\'ve ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don\'t provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn\'t expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we\'ll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. And more specifically, I\'d just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they\'ve been extending – going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well. So I\'m wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has been over the last two years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. I think it\'s a good question, a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it\'s growing strong double digits, and that\'s very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it\'s a big driver for our Services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You\'ve been quoting an overall total company growth rate. But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance. The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn\'t help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we\'ve been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn\'t help us. But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we\'ve seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we\'re able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that I\'ve always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I\'m wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there\'s any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don\'t like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn\'t see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate. And so it\'s somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, this doesn\'t make sense, and we don\'t believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we\'ll see. I don\'t like litigation. And so if there\'s another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don\'t see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that\'s the way I see it. Thanks for your question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We\'ll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the Street\'s expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly. I don\'t know if it\'s a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there. If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we\'ve got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it\'s not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It\'s stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I\'m not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I\'m very bullish on iPad. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay, that\'s great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you said there\'s plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users, and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there\'s lots more to do. I think it\'s become – every year it becomes more important to people\'s lives and there are more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health. I could have talked more about CarPlay. The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we\'ve got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes.

First, Luca, what are the factors that caused you to widen the gross margin guidance for the March quarter? And what are the one or two factors that put you at the low end versus the tailwinds that might put you at the high end of that range? And then I have a follow-up, thank you. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Sure, Katy. If you look back at our history, 100 basis points range for gross margin is not unusual. Clearly during a period when foreign exchange is very volatile, we think it's more prudent to broaden the range a bit. I've mentioned that we expect – assuming that rates don't move too much, we expect foreign exchange to be a major negative as we move from the December to the March quarter. You know that the dollar has appreciated significantly toward the end of the December quarter, and so we've got 80 basis points of sequential headwind from foreign exchange. We also have the sequential loss of leverage, which is typical of our seasonality, but we expect to offset these two impacts with cost efficiencies and also with our mix of products and services. So obviously if the dollar is a little less strong than it is today, we could do a bit better on gross margins. Obviously, we continue to work very hard on our cost efficiency, so we'll see where we land. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. And, Tim, there's a reasonable probability that you may get access to the $200 billion-plus of cash that's been locked overseas. So I think it would be helpful to just get an update on your views around potentially larger M&A and some of the areas of interest that you've noted in the past like owning more original content to penetrate more of the TV opportunity that the company has long talked about addressing. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, I am optimistic given what I'm hearing that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there are people in both parties that would favor repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple. What we would do with it, let's wait and see exactly what it is. But as I said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years. And we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it. In terms of original content, we have put our toe in the water with doing some original content for Apple Music, and that will be rolling out through the year. We are learning from that, and we'll go from there. The way that we participate in the changes that are going on in the media industry that I fully expect to accelerate from the cable bundle beginning to break down is, one, we started the new Apple TV a year ago, and we're pleased with how that platform has come along. We have more things planned for it but it's come a long way in a year, and it gives us a clear platform to build off of. Two, embedded in the 150 million paid subscriptions that I mentioned in my opening comments, there are a number of third-party services that are a part of that, where we participate economically in some of that by offering our platform in selling and distributing. And then thirdly, we are obviously, with our toe in the water, we're learning a lot about the original content business and thinking about ways that we could play at that. Thanks for the question. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thanks a lot. Good afternoon guys. I guess the first question, I really appreciate the information you guys are providing around your Services business, which is up 18% year over year. Can you just talk about? How much of that do you think is growth in your installed base versus increased monetization on a per iOS to iOS basis? And so we are to think about those in two separate tranches? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. I think you're absolutely right, Amit. We look at it that those are the two key elements for us. And what is particularly interesting to us is to see that the number of people that are transacting on our stores is increasing strong double-digits, and we're also seeing that the ARPU per paying customer is increasing double digits, right. So it's a combination of the two. Obviously, the quality and the quantity of content that we make available in our services improves all the time. And we also see that as people getting to the platform and start transacting on the platform, and we keep track of their behavior over time, we actually see that they tend to spend more and more over time. And that's why we are excited about the future of the Services business. And that's why, as Tim said, we have a goal that – it's already become a very large business. It's going to be a Fortune 100 company this year, but we have a goal to double it over the next four years. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC Perfect. And if I could just switch gears on a follow-up, there has been a fair amount of discussions around your market share in China and what's happening over there. Your numbers actually look fairly impressive in Greater China, China specifically. So could you just talk about what are the demand trends you're seeing there on the ground, and how do you see that transpire through the year? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yeah, I'll take this one. If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12%, and about 4 points of that was currency related, so it's an 8 point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China, if you look at the PRC, our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter. And if you look at that on a constant currency basis, it was actually up 6%. So it's a significantly better performance on every way you look at it versus what we had experienced the prior three quarters. Underneath that, what we've seen is that iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter, according to Kantar. Singles Day, which is a huge day in China, as you know, we were the most popular U.S. brand on Alibaba. We set a new record for Services in China, as the company did. And Mac revenue was up double digit year over year. iPad units were also up double digit in Mainland China, which was obviously different than the trend that we saw in the balance of the world. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers, which is a very high number that we're pleased with. And obviously, our total installed base continues to grow there in the strong double digits. That said, the challenges that are there are, one, the currency has devalued 6% year over year. And two, Hong Kong remains a very, very difficult market. And so I look at it in – I'm encouraged with the significant improvement, but we're not without challenges there. And I wouldn't want to imply that, although I do like many, many things that I've seen and how broad-based the pluses were across our product line. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Amit. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Cross Research, Shannon Cross. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the Services business? And what I'm trying to figure out is I think the number was you're going to be doubling within the next four years, at least that's your expectation. So what gets you there? I don't know, maybe if you talk about geographies and how penetrated you are in certain geographies. And then, as you grow your Services business, is there anything we should keep in mind from a margin perspective? Would these be lower margin services or similar, just so we can think about the trajectory and the contribution to the bottom line. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yeah, Shannon, I'll take it. Obviously, within the Services business, we have a number of categories. The App Store is the one that is driving significant growth right now. I said in my opening comments that we grew 43% 13 weeks over 13 weeks, a little even more for the quarter, right. And what we like about the App Store is that it's truly a global platform. So we are seeing significant growth not only in the developed markets, where you expect to see a lot of transaction volume, but we see great growth in places like China, for example. And we know that there are parts of the world where we can do better. We can grow, for example, our developer community in a number of emerging markets. And so as we look, as I was explaining earlier, as we look at the number of people that transact growing double digits, we see the amount spent per paid account growing so well, we think that the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth. On the music front, we are the market leader in digital music. Obviously now, by having the combination of the download business with the streaming service, which we didn't have until recently, we've been able to bring our music business back to growth. We've grown over the last three quarters, and we feel very good about that. Tim has talked about original content. We've had very good success with exclusives. So we know that it's another business that we can grow. Our iCloud storage business is growing very quickly, and so that is a business that also at a geographic level we can continue to grow significantly. Our AppleCare business is growing very well. A lot of it comes from the fact that our install base of devices around the world continues to grow very well, strong double digits. And as we've explained in the past, the vast majority of the services that we provide is not driven by what we sell during the last 90 days. It's much more driven by the install base, and that gives us a tailwind. We're also opening up several new markets because we are accepting new forms of payment. And therefore, it's easier particularly for international customers to take advantage of our services. You were asking about the margin profile. We said many times, in aggregate our Services business tends to have margins that are above company average. They are accretive, so they help us quite a bit from a margin standpoint. Within the Services business, we have very different margin profiles, also because, as you know, we account for some of these services in different ways. In some cases, we transact on a buy/sell basis. In other cases, we perform as agents, for example, to our developers, and that drives different margin percentages. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you. And then my follow-up is just in terms of the elasticity of demand and some of the moves from a currency perspective. I think in the past there was some concern in some of the emerging markets the you were basically not able to – you weren't you're getting the volumes because you had to raise ASPs given the currency. But you talked about a lot of the emerging markets actually doing pretty well this quarter. So I'm just curious. You raised the price on the iPhone 7 Plus and that. What are you seeing, and what are your customers saying in terms of willingness to pay up? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, I was looking back. Since June of 2014, so we're talking about 2.5 years ago, the dollar has strengthened 25% against the basket of currencies where we do business. And so obviously, it is a difficult situation for us. I've mentioned that foreign exchange is a significant headwind for us, both at the revenue level and at the gross margin level. In emerging markets, it's incredible. The level of interest for our products continues to be phenomenal. The brand continues to be very aspirational. There are more and more people that can afford our products around the world. The middle class is growing in places like China, India, Brazil, but certainly the strong dollar doesn't help us. And therefore, when we make pricing decisions, we need to be very careful. We always want to find the optimal balance between units, revenue, and margin, and it becomes more difficult as the dollar appreciates. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Moving on, we'll hear from Brian White with Drexel. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC Luca, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about gross margins. Sales obviously beat the high end of your revenue range. It looks like gross margin was dead down the middle. Can you talk about the puts and takes in gross margins in the quarter, please? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Sure. We were actually at the high end of the range for gross margins. We had guided 38% to 38.5%, and we came in at 38.5% exactly. And really, the slight improvement over the midpoint of the guidance range was due to the fact that our revenue was ahead of our expectations, and so we got a bit more leverage out of the increased revenue levels. We felt very good about the gross margins for the quarter. Again, keep in mind the strong dollar doesn't help us on that front. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC Okay. And, Tim, I didn't hear much mentioned about India. How did India perform with the iPhone? And how should we think about it for 2017, especially with the 4G network going up? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. That's a really good question. Despite the demonetization move in India that created lots of economic pressure there last quarter, despite that, we had all-time record revenue results, and so we were very happy about that. The demonetization impact has not worked its way through yet. It's still definitely having some overhang. But I think in the longer term, it's a great move, and I feel really good about how we're doing there. We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country and believe it's a great place to be. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Brian. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Goldman Sachs, we'll hear from Simona Jankowski. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thank you. I wanted to dig in a little bit more into the iPhone upside in the quarter with record revenues in every region except for Greater China. I think you touched on the percent of switchers in China. But can you give a little more color on the split of upgrades and switchers in some of the other regions and overall as well? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Simona, it's Tim. We did have an exceptional quarter with iPhone, and that was with the backdrop of not predicting the demand very well on the iPhone 7 Plus and therefore being in constraint on it through the quarter. If you look at the absolute number of upgraders, it was the highest that we've seen in any quarter. And if you look at the switcher number, it's the highest that we've seen in any quarter. If you look at the upgrade rate, it's similar to last year. However, I think the big asterisk – I share all this with you for transparency's sake. I would tell you that the way we look at this is in a quarter where you have a supply constraint, it's difficult to draw too many conclusions from it. But I wanted to share that with you anyway so you have the backdrop. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you, and then just one follow-up on China specifically. As your comps get easier this year, I was curious if you think you're going to be returning to growth in that region. And then just to give us the context, I know you talked about the 6% constant currency increase in revenue in Mainland China. But curious if you strip out the double-digit increase in iPad and MacBook and potentially the mix shift to the iPhone 7 Plus, I'm curious what underlying iPhone units did in Mainland China. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. That's a big question, and I don't have the answer in front of me. If you look at iPhone 7 Plus, it was the most popular Plus model that we've ever had. It set a unit record, so that I can share. In terms of how are we going to do, we don't provide guidance at the segment level. But sitting here today, for Q2, I wouldn't expect the year-over-year performance to be dramatically different than the year-over-year performance in Q1. The real comp really begins in the following quarter to a more significant degree, and we'll have to see how that plays out as we get closer to it. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, Toni Sacconaghi. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I just wanted to better understand the upgrade rate dynamics. So I think iPhone units on a sell-through basis were up about 8%. You had an extra week, which gave you about 8%. I understand there were differences of the timing of the launch. So making all those adjustments, it looks like iPhone units were probably up low single digits. But, Luca, you alluded to the fact that your install base was growing double digits. So that would suggest to me that the upgrade rate, the upgrade percentage is actually declining. And more specifically, I'd just like your broader perspective on how investors should think about upgrade rates. It looked like they peaked in the iPhone 6 cycle, and it looks like they've been extending – going lower. Replacement cycles have been extending over the last couple years. I think some of the U.S. carriers alluded to that as well. So I'm wondering if you could step back and just talk a little bit more broadly about how investors should think about or what the trajectory has been over the last two years and how investors should think going forward. Do you believe there are opportunities for that upgrade rate to improve or replacement cycles to accelerate going forward? And what are some of the considerations we should think about? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. I think it's a good question, a number of points that I want to make. Starting with the growth in the install base of iPhones, yes, it's growing strong double digits, and that's very good for us for a number of reasons, including the fact that it's a big driver for our Services business. When we look at it geographically, I think we see different developments. For example, we felt very, very good about the unit growth that we had in many markets around the world. You've been quoting an overall total company growth rate. But when we look at a country-specific level, there were a lot of countries, I would say the majority of the countries, where iPhone units grew strong double digits, starting here in the United States, where for example, the fact that annual upgrade programs are becoming more and more popular is proving to be a positive for us. Same happened in a number of countries around the world, starting with Canada and Australia but also many places in Western Europe as well. Japan grew double digits in terms of units. So I think geographically we are seeing very, very good performance. The point that I think I need to make when you think about upgrade rates, clearly, this issue of the strong dollar doesn't help us. Could we sell significantly more and significantly faster from an upgrade cycle standpoint in places outside the United States, where we've been forced to increase prices by up to 20%, 30%, 40% in certain countries? And you think about the impact that this is having on local demand, obviously that doesn't help us. But overall, I would say as Tim said, when we look at the upgrade rate for and we look at it from the standpoint of the new phones, right, the new generation phones, the upgrade rate, the percentage of people that have upgraded to the new phone has been very similar to what we've seen last year. The 6 cycle was certainly a phenomenal cycle. There was pent-up demand for the larger screen phones. And certainly as we look ahead, we have a role to play. The more we're able to innovate with new generations of products, clearly that plays a role in the upgrade rate. Antonio M. Sacconaghi - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. Tim, I have a question for you. Back in April 2012, you said on one of these earnings calls that I've always hated litigation and I continue to hate it, and I highly prefer to settle versus battle. Yet you recently decided to initiate a lawsuit against Qualcomm. I'm wondering if you can comment on the ostensible change or departure from this viewpoint, and what would be a successful end result of this litigation, and whether you can confirm whether there's any potential gross margin risk in the future as a result of this litigation. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I feel the same way I did in April of 2012. I don't like litigation and view it as a last resort. And so you should take from our filing that we viewed it as we didn't see another way forward. They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate. And so it's somewhat like buying a sofa, and you charge somebody a different price depending upon the price of the house that it goes into. Just from our point of view, this doesn't make sense, and we don't believe it will pass muster in the courts. In addition to that, as a part of their increasingly radical steps they were taking to try to hold up that model, they withheld $1 billion in payments that they owed us. And so we felt like we had no choice was the net of it. In terms of where it goes, we'll see. I don't like litigation. And so if there's another way, then that would be great, but at this point I don't see it. I fully expect at this point in time that it will take some time, but in the end I think common sense will prevail and the courts will see it for what it is. And so that's the way I see it. Thanks for your question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. First, I wanted to ask about the iPad. It looked like it was about to turn possibly even positive. You said it was above your plan, but I think it was pretty well below the Street's expectations. And the ASP deteriorated pretty significantly. I don't know if it's a mix shift. But maybe you can talk about the iPad and what you see going forward. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. The iPad, Steve, we had a 1.6 million-unit swing on channel inventory between the years. In the year-ago quarter we increased by 900,000. In this quarter we decreased by 700,000. On top of that and from an ASP point of view, in the year-ago quarter we launched the iPad Pro 13 Edge. That would be the iPad with obviously the highest price on it. We would have done the channel fill plus the launch of the product, and so that would have bolstered the ASPs in that particular quarter. In addition to all of that, we did under-call the number of iPads that would be in demand for the quarter, and that compounded a shortage issue that we had with one of our suppliers. And so all in all, there were quite a few things going on there. If I zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad. I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching a penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. And so I see a lot of good things and hope for better results, but we are still currently in this shortage issue now, and I'm not projecting to get out of that totally during the quarter. And so it will damper this quarter somewhat. But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Okay, that's great, thank you. And then, Tim, investors tend to think of the iPhone as mature and technology improvements as incremental, yet I believe you said there's plenty of runway left in terms of appealing new features. Do you think there are future enhancements coming that will be viewed as material by users, and particularly changes beyond form factor, beyond the way the phone looks? Are there functional things coming over time that you think could surprise people? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I think the smartphone is still in the early innings of the game. I think there's lots more to do. I think it's become – every year it becomes more important to people's lives and there are more things people are doing with it. I talked a little bit about home automation, but I could have talked about health. I could have talked more about CarPlay. The use of it in the enterprise is growing significantly. And so when I look at all of these things, usage going up, app developers still innovating, we've got some exciting things in the pipeline, I feel really, really good about it. So this is one that we think different about a bunch of things, but maybe this is just one more. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Steve. A replay of today's call will be available for two weeks as a podcast on the iTunes Store, with a webcast on apple.com/investor, and via telephone.

Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Nancy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today we are reporting strong March quarter results, with accelerating revenue growth and earnings per share up 10% over last year. We feel great about this performance. Revenue was $52.9 billion, near the high end of our guidance range. Global revenue was up 5% year on year, with growth accelerating from our December quarter performance. That's despite a $1 billion year-over-year revenue headwind from foreign exchange in the March quarter and a larger iPhone channel inventory reduction this year versus last year. iPhone sales were line in line with our expectations, and we're thrilled to see the continued strong demand for iPhone 7 Plus with its beautiful large display and dual-camera system. Our active installed base of iPhones grew by double digits year over year. And based on the latest data from IDC, we gained market share in nearly every country we track. Late in the quarter, we released the stunning (PRODUCT)RED Special Edition versions of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in recognition of 10 years of our partnership with RED. This relationship has given our customers an unprecedented way to contribute to the global fund and bring the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation. We've seen wonderful customer response to these eye-popping new iPhones. For the second quarter in a row, our Services revenue topped $7 billion, and it's well on the way to being the size of a Fortune 100 company. We're very happy to see the deep level of customer engagement with the Apple ecosystem across all of our services. App Store momentum is terrific, with revenue growing 40% year over year to an all-time quarterly record. The number of developers offering apps for sale on our store was up 26% over last year, and we're thrilled to see their success. We also saw double-digit revenue growth from Apple Music subscriptions and iCloud storage and overall very strong growth in the total number of paid subscriptions for our own services and the third-party content we offer on our stores. Paid subscriptions now exceed 165 million. Apple Pay is experiencing phenomenal traction. With the launch of Taiwan and Ireland in the March quarter, Apple Pay is now live in 15 markets with more than 20 million contactless-ready locations, including more than 4.5 million locations accepting Apple Pay in the U.S. alone. We're seeing strong growing usage as points of acceptance expand, with transaction volume up 450% over the last 12 months. In the UK, for example, points of acceptance have grown by 44% in the last year, while monthly Apple Pay transactions have grown by nearly 300%. In Japan, where Apple Pay launched last October, more than 0.5 million transit users are completing 20 million Apple Pay transactions per month. And we're always excited to see our partners bring their customers new ways to use Apple Pay. You can now even send a Starbucks gift card via iMessage with just a touch. We're seeing great momentum from our powerful advances in Messages. In fact, at one point during the Super Bowl in February, customers were sending 380,000 Messages per second, more than double the previous year. A few weeks ago, we introduced Clips, a new app that's another great example of how we're continually making our products even more engaging, and it's off to a great start. With Clips, it's fun and easy to combine video, photos, and music on an iPhone or an iPad into great-looking expressive videos with great visual effects and titles just using your voice, then share your clips with friends through the Messages app or on social media. We had great Mac results during the quarter. Revenue grew 14% to a new March quarter record and gained market share thanks to strong demand for our new MacBook Pros. Our Mac business has generated over $25 billion in revenue over the past four quarters. We're investing aggressively in its future, and we are very excited about the innovation we can bring to the platform. We also updated our most popular sized iPad with a brighter Retina display and best-in-class performance at its most affordable price ever, and customer response to date has been very strong. iPad results were ahead of our expectations, and we believe we gained share during the March quarter in a number of major markets, including the U.S., Japan, and Australia. iPad remains the world's most popular tablet, and it's the primary computing device for millions of customers across the globe. Building on the momentum from the holiday quarter, Apple Watch sales nearly doubled year over year. Apple Watch is the best-selling and most loved smartwatch in the world, and we hear wonderful stories from our customers about its impact on their fitness and health. We're also seeing great response to AirPods, with a 98% customer satisfaction rating based on a recent Creative Strategy survey. Demand for AirPods significantly exceeds supply, and growth in Beats products has also been very strong. In fact, when we combine Apple Watch, AirPods, and Beats headphones, our revenue from wearable products in the last four quarters was the size of a Fortune 500 company. In Greater China, we were very pleased to see strong double-digit revenue growth from both Mac and Services during the March quarter. We also had great results from our retail stores in mainland China, with total store revenue up 27% over last year and comp store revenue up 7%. These results contributed to our improving performance in Greater China. Through the first two quarters of fiscal 2017, our year-over-year comparisons improved significantly over the last two quarters of fiscal 2016. First half revenue was down 13% year over year, about a third of which was attributable to FX. That's in contrast to a 32% revenue decline in the second half of last year. Our March quarter results were in line with our expectations, and similar to the year-over-year performance we experienced in the December quarter. We continue to be very enthusiastic about our opportunity in China. We set a new March quarter record for India, where revenue grew by strong double digits. We continue to strengthen our local presence across the entire ecosystem, and we're very optimistic about our future in this remarkable country with its very large, young, and tech-savvy population, fast-growing economy, and improving 4G network infrastructure. Apple Retail is entering an exciting chapter with new experiences for customers and breathtaking new store designs. With the opening of our newest store in Dubai this past weekend, we now have 495 retail locations worldwide. The new Apple Dubai Mall is a truly international store, with employees who collectively speak 45 languages, and are already welcoming customers from around the world. As Luca will discuss in a moment, today we're also providing an update to our capital return program. Given our strong confidence in our future, we're increasing the program size by $50 billion, bringing the total to $300 billion, and we're extending the timeframe through March of 2019. We're adding to our share repurchase authorization and increasing our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. We're very excited about our upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference taking place in San Jose next month. The conference is significantly oversubscribed, and we'll be welcoming thousands of attendees. We look forward to helping them learn about breakthrough technologies across all four of our software platforms – iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS – that enable developers to create incredible experiences for every aspect of customers' lives and improve the way they manage their homes, cars, health, and more. I'm very proud to mention that we recently released our 10th annual Environmental Responsibility Report, reflecting our amazing progress. In 2016, 96% of the electricity used at Apple's global facilities came from renewable sources of energy, reducing our carbon emissions by nearly 585,000 metric tons. We're now 100% renewable in 24 countries, including all of Apple's data centers. There's much more work to be done, but we're committed to leaving the world better than we found it. Closer to home, we're excited about moving into our new corporate headquarters, Apple Park, our new center for innovation. The main building on Apple Park is designed to house 13,000 employees under one roof in an environment that fosters even greater collaboration among our incredibly talented teams. We have many more ongoing investments in the United States economy, since Apple is a company that could only have been created in America. Through our innovative products and the success of our business, we're incredibly proud to support more than 2 million jobs in all 50 states, and we expect to create even more. Last fiscal year, we spent more than $50 billion in the United States with American suppliers, developers, and partners, and we continue to invest confidently in our future. Now for more details on the March quarter results, I'd like to turn the call over to Luca. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $52.9 billion, and we achieved double-digit growth in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Turkey, Russia and Mexico. Our growth rates were even higher, over 20% in many other markets, including Brazil, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe, India, Korea and Thailand. Gross margin was 38.9%, at the high end of our guidance range. That's a sequential increase from 38.5% in the December quarter, which is particularly impressive given the seasonal loss of leverage, sequential foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points, and cost pressures on certain commodities. Operating margin was 26.7% of revenue and net income was $11 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $2.10, an increase of 10% over last year, and cash flow from operations was strong at $12.5 billion. For details by product, I'll start with iPhone. We sold 50.8 million iPhones, and we reduced iPhone channel inventory by 1.2 million units in the quarter, compared to a reduction of about 450,000 a year ago. So our iPhone performance was slightly better than last year on a sell-through basis. We had very solid iPhone growth in four of our five operating segments and experienced especially strong results in Western Europe, the Middle East, and our Rest of Asia-Pacific segment, all areas of the world where iPhone sales were up double digits. iPhone ASP was $655, up from $642 a year ago, thanks to a strong mix of iPhone 7 Plus and in spite of unfavorable foreign exchange rates. We exited the March quarter within our five to seven-week target channel inventory range. Customer interest and satisfaction with iPhone are very strong, not only with consumers but also with business users. In the U.S., the latest data from 451 Research on consumers indicates a 96% customer satisfaction rating among iPhone 7 owners and 98% for iPhone 7 Plus. Among corporate smartphone buyers, iPhone customer satisfaction was 95%. And of those planning to purchase smartphones in the June quarter, 79% plan to purchase iPhone. Turning to Services, we generated $7 billion in revenue, an increase of 18% year over year and our best results ever for a 13-week quarter. We're very happy with the strong level of growth, especially given the tough compare to last year, as the busy week between Christmas and New Year's fell within the March fiscal quarter a year ago but was included in the December fiscal quarter this year. As we said last quarter, our goal is to double the size of our Services business by 2020. The App Store established a new all-time revenue record and grew 40% year over year. We continue to see growth in average revenue per paying account as well as the number of paying accounts across our content stores during the quarter. In fact, the quarterly increase in the number of paying accounts was the largest that we've ever experienced. And according to App Annie's latest report, the App Store continues to be the preferred destination for customer purchases, generating twice the revenue of Google Play during the March quarter. Next I'd like to talk about the Mac. Revenue was up 14% year over year and set a new March quarter record. We sold 4.2 million Macs, up 4% over last year, compared to zero growth in the PC market according to IDC's latest forecast. Demand for MacBook Pro was very strong, helping to drive overall portables growth of 10%, twice the growth of the portables market. We ended the quarter at the low end of our four to five-week target range for Mac channel inventory. Turning to iPad, we sold 8.9 million units, which was ahead of our expectations despite supply constraints throughout the quarter. We are very pleased to see iPad growth in the U.S. during the March quarter and revenue growth worldwide for our 9.7-inch and larger iPads over the last four quarters. iPad channel inventory was essentially flat from the beginning to the end of the quarter, and we exited just below our five to seven-week target range. iPad remains very successful in the segments of the tablet market where we compete. Recent data from NPD indicates that iPad had 81% share of the U.S. market for tablets priced above $200. And in February, 451 Research measured consumer satisfaction rates for iPad that range from 95% for the 9.7-inch iPad Pro to 100% for the 12.9-inch version. Among U.S. consumers planning to purchase a tablet within the next six months, purchase intention for iPad was 69%. Corporate buyers reported a 96% satisfaction rate and a purchase intent of 68% for the June quarter. All our products continue to be extremely popular and drive more buying transformation in the enterprise market. We set a new enterprise revenue record for the March quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue for the remainder of the year. Recently, Volkswagen selected iPhone as their corporate standard smartphone, so 620,000 employees around the world have the opportunity to enjoy the best-in-class mobile experience that iPhone offers. And Capital One has reimagined the customer banking experience by empowering their associates with Mac and Apple Watch and over 40 native iOS applications now running on nearly 30,000 iPhones and iPads. We're also seeing strong momentum with our enterprise partners, who are helping us deliver long-lasting innovation and differentiation for iOS versus competing platforms. The Deloitte partnership is off to a great start, with more than 115 customer opportunities in the pipeline across 15 different industries. SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS at the end of March, and over 3 million SAP developers now have an even better means to develop powerful iOS-native apps for the enterprise. The partnership with Cisco enables optimized performance of iOS devices over their networks and is generating a large and growing pipeline of sales opportunities across multiple verticals, including healthcare and financial services. And our partnership with IBM continues to drive greater productivity and innovation, with IBM Mobile First for iOS apps now in more than 3,300 client engagements. And with its Mobile at Scale offering, IBM recently closed an agreement to deploy 11,000 iOS devices at Santander Bank to drive digital transformation. Our retail and online stores produced great results, with strong revenue growth in all our geographic segments and 18% growth overall. Visitors to our retail and online stores were up 16% over last year, and we added four new stores during the March quarter. And with the opening of our store in Dubai last week, we're now at 495 stores in 18 countries. Let me now turn to our cash position. We ended the quarter with $256.8 billion in cash plus marketable securities, a sequential increase of $10.8 billion. $239.6 billion of this cash, or 93% of the total, was outside the United States. We issued $11 billion in debt during the quarter, bringing us to $88.5 billion in term debt and $10 billion in commercial paper outstanding. We returned over $10 billion to investors during the quarter. We paid $3 billion in dividends and equivalents, and we spent $4 billion on repurchases of 31.1 million Apple shares through open market transactions. We also launched a new $3 billion ASR, resulting in initial delivery and retirement of 17.5 million shares. And we retired 6.3 million shares upon the completion of our ninth accelerated share repurchase program in February. All these activities contributed to a net diluted share count reduction of 66.3 million shares in the quarter. We have now completed $211.2 billion of our $250 billion capital return program, including $151 billion in share repurchases. As Tim mentioned, today we're announcing an update to our program, which we are extending by four quarters through March of 2019, and increasing in size to a total of $300 billion. Once again, given our strong confidence in Apple's future and the value we see in our stock, we are allocating the majority of the program expansion to share repurchases. Our board has increased the share repurchase authorization by $35 billion, raising it from the current $175 billion level to $210 billion. We will also continue to net share settle vesting employees' restricted stock units. In addition, we're raising our dividend for the fifth time in less than five years. As we know, this is very important to many of our investors who value income. The quarterly dividend will grow from $0.57 to $0.63 per share, an increase of 10.5%. This is effective with our next dividend, which the board has declared today, payable on May 18, 2017 to shareholders of record as of May 15, 2017. With over $12 billion in annual dividend payments, we're proud to be one of the largest dividend payers in the world, and we continue to plan for annual dividend increases going forward. In total, with this updated program, during the next eight quarters we expect to return $89 billion to our investors, which represents about 12% of our market cap at the current stock price. We expect to continue to fund our capital return program with current U.S. cash, future U.S. cash generation and borrowing from both domestic and international debt markets. We will continue to review capital allocation regularly, taking into account the needs of our business, investment opportunities, and our financial outlook. We'll also continue to solicit input on our program from a broad base of shareholders. This approach will allow us to be flexible and thoughtful about the size, the mix, and the pace of our program. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $43.5 billion and $45.5 billion. We expect gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $6.6 billion and $6.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be about $450 million, and we expect the tax rate to be about 25.5%. With that, I'd like to open the call to questions. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Luca, and we ask that you limit yourself to one one-part question and one follow-up. Rebecca, may we have the first question, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was – wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From JPMorgan, Rod Hall. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, thank you. I had a question for Luca first. Last year, you had a 4 million-unit channel inventory reduction for the iPhone in the June quarter. So just curious what you're expecting for this year just so we have an apples-to-apples comparison as we think about your guidance. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. As you know, Simona, we do not provide guidance around units and around channel inventory reduction, but our goal is always to have the right amount of weeks of inventory in the channel. And if you look at our history over the last several years, we have fairly consistently reduced channel inventory in the June quarter, so I think it's a fair expectation to have. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you, and then just for Tim. Tim, you've been excited about the India market for some time and have made strides in establishing a retail, manufacturing, and R&D presence there. So just curious as you look at that market and the rollout of 4G there, is it reasonable for us to assume that Apple can sell something on the order of 10 million to 20 million iPhones there next year and then grow from there? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We make it a point not to forecast by geo. We just provide a current quarter forecast. But as hopefully you've seen as we began to give you more information about India, we've been investing quite a bit. We have a ton of energy going into the country on a number of fronts, and it is the third largest smartphone market in the world today behind China and the United States. And so we believe, particularly now that the 4G infrastructure is going in the country and is continuing to be expanded, that there is a huge opportunity for Apple there. And so that and the demographics of the country is why we're putting so much energy there. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Simona. Could we have the next question, please? Operator Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you very much and congratulations on returning to growth consistently. That's great. I believe, Tim, in your prepared comments you mentioned India was growing double digit, which is great. But I believe if you look at geographic information, India is really underpenetrated from an Apple reception perceptive, but yet they have LTE, you have the iPhone SE, a lower priced iPhone. Do you think that say this next 12 – 18 months is going be a turning point, or is it more you need to work with the government to have Apple-owned stores or production there? Or what's it really going to take to get India going along because we think it's just truly a great opportunity? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. We think it's a great opportunity too, and so we're bringing all the things that we brought to bear in other markets that we've eventually done well in, and that's from channel to stores to our ecosystem and so forth. Phil [Schiller] was just over there opening a developer center last quarter, and so there are a ton of things going on there. And we agree that we are underpenetrated there. Our growth rates are good, really good by most people's expectations, maybe not mine as much. And so we're putting a lot of energy in, just like we have in other geos that eventually wound up producing more and more. So I'm very excited about it. The 4G network investment really began rolling in in a significant way toward the last quarter of last year, as you know. But they are moving fast. They're moving at a speed that I have not seen in any other country in the world once they were started, and it is truly impressive. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Great, thanks so much for the detail. That's greatly appreciated. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Jim.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator First we'll hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes, thanks. My first question is for Luca around gross margins. How were you able to expand gross margins sequentially and guide rather seasonally for the June quarter in light of what's going on in the memory market. And maybe if you can, comment in particular whether the hold back of payments to Qualcomm is benefiting you at all on gross margins year on year, and also whether your contracts around commodity prices is likely to hit gross margins by more in the back half of this calendar year. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy, a lot of questions. Let me take them one by one. Let me start with our performance for the March quarter, which we were very happy with. As you said, we were up 40 basis points sequentially. And this is in spite of the fact, as you know, that we lose leverage as we go from the December quarter to the March quarter. The foreign exchange headwind on a sequential basis was 100 basis points. Obviously, that was also a negative. And as you said, we started to experience some level of cost pressure on the memory side, particularly on NAND and DRAM. To offset that, and actually do better than that, we had very good cost performance on other commodities. And the fact that our Services mix increases as we go through the year, that is of course also helping, given the profile of our gross margin for Services. So that answers the question around Q2. As we move into the June quarter, as you know, we tend to have some level of gross margin compression as we go from the March quarter to the June quarter. Again, the majority of that comes from the sequential loss of leverage. We also have a different mix of products as we move into the June quarter, and the cost pressures on memory will remain. We expect to offset partially these impacts with other cost efficiencies, and again, with a mix shift towards Services. The impact on NAND and DRAM will continue to be there, and we expect it to be there. You know we don't guide past the June quarter, but we expect it to be there for the time being. On Qualcomm, I just want to make it very, very clear that we are accruing. We do not expect to be paying more than what we are accruing right now. So we didn't get any benefit in our P&L, in our margins, during the March quarter, and we're not getting any benefit during the June quarter either. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, thank you. And just a follow-up for Tim, as you noted in your remarks, the iPhone 7 Plus demand, it's selling incredibly well. And this was a product that was pretty severely supply-constrained in the December quarter. And I just wonder whether there are any lessons learned as you go forward into future product launches around how you manage the timing of announcing a product when there are supply constraints, and how you might work with the supply chain differently around ramping some of these components that have particular difficulties around the yields early on. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Katy, one of the things that we did not get right was the mix between the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. There was – wound up that demand was much stronger to the iPhone 7 Plus than we had predicted. And so it took us a little while to adjust all the way back through the supply chain and to bring iPhone 7 Plus into balance, which occurred early this past quarter. What did we learn from it? Every time we go through a launch, we learn something. And you can bet that we're brushing up our models, and we'll apply everything we learn to the next time. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thank you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Katy. Could we have the next question, please? Operator We'll go to Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Thank you very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what's going on in China and give us some more color, especially as you're going through the year? And then obviously you won't talk about the next product launch, but just are there any shifts in demand with Greater China down 14%? Was it all iPhone, or a mix? Anything you can provide, and then I have a follow-up. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes, thanks for the question, Shannon. We saw in Q2 a performance that combined with Q1 to form the first half of the year was much better than what we experienced in the second half of last year. And if you look at what was driving that, iPhone 7 Plus, we sold the highest number of Plus models in the first half than ever before, compared to 6s Plus or compared to the 6 Plus. Also, the Mac business did extremely well. The Mac revenue growth was up 20% in China, and we had extremely strong Services growth during the quarter in China. As I mentioned in my comments, our retail and online stores did well overall and in China. They grew by 21%, which is an acceleration from what we had seen in the previous quarter. And traffic – which for us is incredibly important in the retail stores because we do a lot more than sell – traffic was up 27% year on year. And now seven of our top ten highest traffic stores in the world are in Greater China. And so that's the set of things that went in our direction, so to speak. On the flip side, currency devalued by 5%, and so that's not an insignificant headwind. And our performance continued to be weak in Hong Kong, which has been hit a bit harder as the tourism market continues to slump. Also, where the iPhone 7 Plus did well, we didn't perform as well on some of the previous generation iPhones. And so that's the set of things on the plus and minus side. We did perform about where I thought we would. At least I thought it would be similar to the previous quarter, and it was. What I now believe is that we'll improve a bit more during this current quarter, not back to growth, but improve – but make more progress. And we continue to believe that there's an enormous opportunity there. And in the scheme of things, our business is pretty large there. Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC Great, thank you. And then I don't know if Luca wants to take this, but thoughts on cash usage. You increased your program, but you still have I think $160 billion of net cash and obviously continue to generate cash. So I'm curious as to, given some of the commentary that's come out of the administration, which I think most companies were expecting some sort of return, how do you generally think about what you need to run the business from a cash perspective, how you think about the balance sheet from a strength perspective as we look forward to what hopefully will come through? Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Shannon, you know how we run our capital return program. We've been pretty consistent during the last five years. Essentially for the last five years, the way we've run the company is essentially to return our free cash flow to our investors. That's what we've done with the program until now, and the expansion of the program that we've announced today goes in the same direction. We know how much we need to invest in the business. We will never underinvest in the business. We're in a very fortunate position that we generate cash beyond the needs that we have. And given the current capital structure that we have, we decided that until now we return about 100% of the free cash flow to investors. It's difficult for us to speculate about what might or might not happen. The program that we're announcing today reflects the current tax legislation in this country, and there's a lot that still needs to happen there, and we'll see. Obviously, we will reassess our situation if things change. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From JPMorgan, Rod Hall. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start off just going back to the 165 million subscriptions and ask Tim or Luca if you could comment on the unique number of users there. And I think you had made a comment, Tim, in your prepared remarks that the average revenue per user was up, or maybe that was you, Luca. But if you guys could just talk about any more color around that average revenue per user, it would be interesting to us. And then I have one follow-up to that. Thanks. Luca Maestri - Apple, Inc. Yes, I'll take it, Rod. We don't disclose into the number of subscriptions. Of course, we're just giving you the total count of subscriptions that are out there. Of course, there are several customers that subscribe to more than one of our services. There is some level of overlap, but the total number of subscribers is very, very large, obviously less than 165 million. But it's very good for us to see the breadth of subscriptions that we offer and that customers are interested in. It's a large number. And if you remember, we quoted the same number a quarter ago and we talked about 150 million. So when you think about a sequential increase of 15 million subscriptions from the December quarter to the March quarter, it really gives you a sense for the momentum that we have on our content stores. It's quite impressive to add 15 million subscriptions in 90 days. As we look at the dynamics that are happening on our content stores, particularly on the App Store, which is the largest, we see fairly consistently two things. We see that the number of paying accounts is growing a lot. And I mentioned the increase in number of paying accounts that we value in this last 90 days is the largest that we've ever had. So this very large number of people coming into the ecosystem, experiencing the ecosystem, which is obviously improving all the time in quality and quantity, and then start paying and transacting on our stores, and that number is growing very, very strongly, strong double digits. What we're also seeing as we look at people that start paying on our stores, we see a pretty common trend over time. And we keep track of that across cohorts of customers, that as people come into the ecosystem and start paying on the ecosystem, we see a spending profile that is very similar around the world. People start at a certain level and then they tend to spend more over time. And so obviously, the combination of people spending more over time and adding more people that are now actually spending on the stores contributes to this 40% growth that Tim mentioned for the App Store on a year-over-year basis. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay, thanks, Luca, and then I had a follow-up for Tim. Tim, I wanted to just ask. The Services revenue keeps growing, and of course the profit contribution from that is growing. And we've also at the same time I think seen you maybe a little more aggressive than Apple has been historically in pricing certain key technologies, let's call them, that maybe you want to penetrate the market with. I just wonder if you could just comment a little bit on your strategy there in terms of the usage of that extra profit contribution from that Services business, how you intend to apply it to the rest of the business. Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Rod, the way that we think about pricing is we come up with a price that we think is a good value for the product that we're delivering, and we do that on the hardware side as well as on the Services side. And so that's how we think about it. We're really not thinking about taking profits from one to subsidize the other or vice-versa. Rod Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC Great, thank you very much. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Yes. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thanks, Rod. Could we have the next question, please? Operator From UBS, Steve Milunovich. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Tim, could you comment on the opportunity in wearables? The watch, some people consider disappointing, had what seems to be a very good quarter, and ironically the competition almost seems to be fading in that part of the market right now. The AirPods of course are doing well. Do you see wearables: A), expanding over time into a broader product line; and B), increasingly being independent of the iPhone longer term? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. We have seen the watch as a really key product category for us since before we launched it. We took our time to get it right, and we've made it even better with the Series 2 offering. And we're really proud of the growth of the business. The watch units more than doubled in six of our top ten markets, which is phenomenal growth, particularly in a non-holiday quarter. And so we couldn't be more satisfied with it. As some people are doing when you begin to combine the watch revenues with the revenues for AirPods, and as you know, this was the first full quarter of shipments for AirPods. It's still very much in the ramping mode, and we're not coming close to satisfying the demand. And then add the Beats products that a group of our customers really enjoy as well, and look on the trailing 12 months – so this is not a forecast – that business was well into the Fortune 500. And so as I look at that, that's pretty fast to come that far. The watch hasn't out very long and AirPods has been out there for three, four months, and so we feel really great about it. Where does it go? I wouldn't want to comment on that, but we do have a really great pipeline here. And I think in terms of competition falling out and so forth, the watch area is really hard. It in essence from an engineering point of view is similar to a phone in terms of the intricacies and so forth. And so I'm not very surprised that some people are falling out of it. But we're very committed to it and believe that – it's already a big business and believe over time it will be even larger. Thanks for the question. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. And then there was a – you mentioned the 451 Research survey. They did have a couple findings that were interesting. One is a nine-year low in iPhone purchase intent, and that might just be where you are in the cycle. And the other was a declining retention rate in the U.S. toward 80%. Any comment on either of those and whether you're concerned? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. I only glanced at it, and so I haven't had time to study it. But in general, what we are seeing, we're seeing what we believe to be a pause in purchases on iPhone, which we believe are due to the earlier and much more frequent reports about future iPhones. And so that part is clearly going on, and it could be what's behind the data. I don't know, but we are seeing that in full transparency. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Thanks for the question. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Steve. Can we have the next question, please? Operator From Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Yes, thank you. I have two as well. First, Tim, I'm wondering if you can comment on your recent decision and the rationale for withholding royalty payments to Qualcomm. And really specifically, I wonder what you believe is the risk that Qualcomm could have a detrimental response, such as withholding modem chip sales or potentially even getting an injunction on iPhones in select geographies around the world. And I'd like to understand your perspective on whether either of those are real risk to any degree. And why would Apple potentially take on those risks just in advance of what will arguably be your most significant and largest product launch in history? Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. Anyone that has a standards-essential patent has a responsibility to offer it to everyone that would like it under what are called FRAND terms. FRAND stands for fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory terms. That's both the price and the business terms. Qualcomm has not made such an offer to Apple. And so I don't believe that a – I don't believe anyone is going to decide to enjoin the iPhone based on that. I think that there's plenty of case law around that subject, but we shall see. In terms of why we're withholding royalties, you can't pay something when there's a dispute about the amount. You don't know how much to pay. And so they think we owe some amount, we think we owe a different amount, and there hasn't been a meeting of the minds there. And so at this point, we need the courts to decide that. Unless we are able to, over time, settle between us on some amount, but right now we're depending upon the courts to do that. And so that is the thinking. The reason that we're pursuing this is that Qualcomm's trying to charge Apple a percentage of the total iPhone value. And they do some really great work around standards-essential patents, but it's one small part of what an iPhone is. It's not – it has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done. And so we don't think that's right, and so we're taking a principled stand on it. And we strongly believe we're in the right, and I'm sure they believe that they are. And that's what courts are for. And so we'll let it go with that. A.M. Sacconaghi, Jr. - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Thank you. I was wondering if I could just follow up a little bit on iPhone demand. If I try and adjust for the drawdown in inventory and the extra week last quarter, I think sequentially iPhones declined about 27% if I make those adjustments. And that's actually quite a bit lower than the normal seasonality we would see from Q1 to Q2, which is typically closer to 20%. I understand your comments around China, but your comparison was 40 points easier this quarter relative to last quarter. And the growth rate improved only marginally, I think, when you adjust for the extra week. And then you made a final comment around a pause on iPhones. So I'm wondering if you could maybe elaborate on, was the below sequential, at least by my calculation, growth rate in Q2 attributable to a pause? And can you characterize what you think upgrade rates are doing, perhaps broadly by geography, to help us better understand what might be happening, or whether there are competitive dynamics that also are at play here that, again, might be contributing to that pause and that sequential decline that I referenced? Thank you. Timothy Donald Cook - Apple, Inc. There are a lot of questions there. Let me give you some color as I see it. In this quarter, we reduced channel inventory by 1.2 million units. And so if you look on a year-over-year basis, which is primarily what we look at from a unit point of view because it would have the seasonality embedded in that, we grew sell-through on a year-over-year basis. Last quarter, I'm sure other folks remember, was a 14-week quarter, and so you have to adjust the rates last quarter to get at what the underlying sell-through growth was. And so I think that when you do that, you're going to find that actually the year-over-year performance is similar between the quarters. In terms of upgraders, we saw the largest absolute number of upgraders ever in any six-month period in the first half of this year, first half of this fiscal year to be precise. And we saw the largest absolute number of switchers outside of Greater China in the same period that we've ever seen. And so in four of the five operating segments, as I think Luca mentioned in his comments, we had very good growth. And it was really propelled by the demand for iPhone 7 Plus, which is growing incredibly fast around the world. And so that's kind of the color I would add there, and hopefully some of that is useful for you. Nancy Paxton - Apple, Inc. Thank you, Toni. Could we have the next question, please?

Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead. Dan Cravens Thanks and good morning, everyone and welcome to the American Airlines Group third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call today is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room for our question-and-answer session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP People and Communications, Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer, Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs and Don Casey, Senior Vice President of Revenue Management. As is our normal practice, we are going to start the call today with Doug and he will provide an overview of the third quarter financial results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the fourth quarter. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from these comments, we will open the call for analysts questions and lastly, questions from the media. Before we begin, we must state that today’s call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecasts of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning, such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website. A webcast of this call also will be archived on our website, the information that we're giving you on the call is as of today’s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. And at this point, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker. Doug Parker Thanks, Dan. Thanks everybody for being on. Pretax earnings excluding special items of $1.5 billion that's down from last year's $1.9 million, but both by declining new revenues our total CASM was down 2.2% versus last year. And increasing unit cost driven primarily by investor synergy but while they're down our still second-best third quarter in history of American Airlines behind only the third quarter of 2015. Also because of our share repurchase activity our adjusted EPS was actually up even though earnings were down from $2.77 up to $2.80 in the quarter. So these results are due to fantastic team in American doing an amazing job for our customary. They were extremely grateful. They have done what they do. On the revenue front Rob will provide a lot more details and we're encouraged by the trends. Our CASM was down 2.2% in the third quarter, but that's better than we've seen in terms of the decline in recent quarters, as better than our competitors were experiencing. In fact the month of September CASM was actually improved year-over-year, which was the first month of year-over-year CASM improvement for American Airlines since November of 2014. Now course September was helped by the calendar on a year-over-year basis, which is why we at Americans would like to focus much on monthly revenue numbers, but the trends is good and it appears to be continuing as we'll discuss. Our unit cost grew in the quarter and Derek will provide more detail on that, but the primary driver of the unit cost increase is our decision to invest in team. We had pay increases and profit-sharing that are by far the largest drivers of the cost increase and we're pleased to be able to provide those improvements to our team members. We now reached new agreements with all of our workgroups. So the large increases are behind us. Furthermore as we complete more of our integration in 2017, we'll be able to being eliminating some of the redundancy still exist because of the two airlines and that will help us reduce expenses in 2018 and beyond. As integration we had enormous success earlier this month with the flawless integration of our flight operating system FOS. This is an extremely complicated system integration that's lead to operational disruptions of that airlines as they've gone through mergers and our team executed without a hitch. While we're doing all that, we continue to invest in our products and improve the product. We had 12 new aircrafts as part of our unprecedented fleet renewal program report. American fleet is now more than 40% younger of large network years and that gap is widening. We had 10 new destinations to our network including five acumens new service from LA to Hong Kong next monthly we'll begin daily flights to Havana and then you have position as the largest carrier to Cuba. We continue to make enormous improvements to our clubs including in this quarter, the reopening of a renovated Admirals Club in Rio de Janeiro and the refurbishment of our London Heathrow Arrivals Club, which now has 29 shower rooms and business center. So in summary, the U.S. airline industry has been transformed and American Airlines is well-positioned for success in the new world. We're producing record profits, new record profits despite a soft economic environment and we're using those profits to improve customer service through important investments in both our products and energy and we're returning the excess cash to our shareholders through share repurchases. So there is much work ahead but the American team continues to further up the challenge. We're extremely pleased with where we are and very bullish on the future of American Airlines. So now I would like to turn over to Derek, who will provide more details on the financial results and then to our recently appointed President, Robert Isom, who will discuss operating performance and revenue environment. Derek? Derek Kerr Thanks Doug and good morning, everyone. We filed our 10-Q and earnings press release this morning and in that release, our third quarter 2016 GAAP net profit was $737 million or a $1.40 $1.40 per diluted share. This compares to our third quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $1.7 billion or $2.49 per diluted share and if we exclude the special charges, we reported a net profit of $933 million in the third quarter of 2016 or $1.76 per diluted share versus the third quarter net profit of $1.9 billion in 2015 or $2.77 per diluted share. Our GAAP third quarter pretax profit was $1.2 billion, equating to a pretax margin of 11.2%. Excluding special charges, our third quarter pretax profit was $1.5 billion, which resulted in a pretax margin of 14%. Excluding the effects of special charges and the non-cash tax provision of $449 million our third quarter 2016 adjusted fully diluted EPS was $2.80 per share, compared to $2.77 in the third quarter of 2015, reflecting a 22% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the quarter. We continue to see sequential improvement in the revenue environment during the quarter, which Robert will talk more about for the quarter. Total operating revenues were $10.6 billion down 1.1% year-over-year. Passenger revenues were $9.1 billion, down 2.2%, driven by a 0.6% decline in yields. Cargoes revenues were down 5.1% to a $171 million due primarily to a decline in international and domestic yields. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion up 8.5% versus the same period last year due to the impact of the new credit card deal signed with Barclays U.S. City and MasterCard on July 12, 2016. Total GAAP operating expenses were $9.2 billion up 5.2% versus the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in our people through contractual increases and the introduction of profit sharing plan, investments in our product, investment which includes our fleet as Doug talked about and investments in our operation. These investments were offset in part by lower fuel costs, our average mainline fuel price including taxes for the third quarter of 2016 was down 12.4% year-over-year to $1.46 per gallon. Third quarter mainline cost per ASM was 11.96 up 5.6% year-over-year, excluding special charges and fuel our mainline CASM was 9.32 up 8.9% year-over-year. Regional operating cost per ASM in the third quarter was 18.85, which was down 5.2% from the quarter in 2015, excluding special charges and fuel, regional CASM was 15.08, a decrease of 4.4% due to the continued shift to more efficient large regional jets. We ended the third quarter of 2016 with approximately $9.2 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.8 billion and $2.4 billion in an undrawn revolver capacity well in the excess -- well in excess of the $6.5 billion minimal liquidity we seek to maintain for this foreseeable future. The company also had 635 million classified as restricted cash during the quarter. We did generate $1.1 billion during the quarter of cash flow from operations and made $372 million in debt payments. We continue to believe it is important to retain liquidity levels higher than our network peers given our overall leverage and the fact that we have not yet completed our fleet renewal program, which will be substantially complete in 2017. During the quarter, the company took advantage of favorable market conditions and completed several financing transactions including a re-pricing of the company's 2014 term loan collateralized by our London Heathrow flights which reduced interest by 25 basis points and the issuance of $814 million EETC consisting of both AA and A tranches which priced at a blended rate of just over 3%. In the third quarter of 2016, the company returned $669 million to its shareholders including quarterly dividend payments of $53 million and the repurchase of $616 million of common stock for 18.2 million shares. Since our capital return program started in mid-2014, the company has returned $9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee equity awards and share distributions and a cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped 31% from $756 million and merger closed in December 2013 to 519.2 million shares on September 30, 2016. At the end of the third quarter 2016, the company had approximately 555 million remaining on its current share repurchase authorization. Turning to our guidance for the remainder of 2016, we continue to monitor our capacity plans and in our IR update issued last week, we lowered full-year 2016 system capacity guidance by 0.5 point and are forecasting it to be up approximately 1.5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline capacity to be 57.5 billion ASMs and our regional capacity to be 7.84 billion ASMs. So our consolidated capacity will be flat year-over-year in the fourth quarter. On the cost side, we're forecasting year-over-year mainline CASM excluding special items and fuel to be up approximately 5% to 7%, while regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is projected to be down approximately 3% to 5%. For the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect our mainline CASM excluding fuel and special items to be up between 8% and 10%. This year-over-year increase is driven primarily by investment in our people of about six points, maintenance timing of two points and DNA from new aircraft and to increase CapEx of one point. Regional CASM excluding special items and fuel is expected to be down by approximately 3% to 5% in the same period. As we look forward for the first time since mid-2014, year-over-year fuel prices are expected to be higher through the remainder of the year. Based on the forward curve as of October 17, our mainline fuel price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2016 is $1.59 to $1.64 per gallon, while our regional fuel forecast for the fourth quarter is $1.65 to $1.70. Despite these higher fuel prices, we expect the full-year 2016 consolidated fuel expense to decrease by approximately $1.2 billion year-over-year. Using the midpoint of the guidance we just provided along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give, we expect our fourth quarter pretax margin excluding special items to be between 4% and 6%. For capital expenditures, we still expect total gross CapEx to be approximately $4.4 billion in 2016. We've 20 deliveries worth approximate $1.1 billion, which will occur in the fourth quarter and we expect to invest $300 million in non-aircraft CapEx in the quarter, which is $1.2 billion for the full year, which includes continued integration work and investments to improve our product and operations, some that Doug referred to in his comments. Looking out to 2017, we are taking a disciplined approach to matching our plan capacity levels with anticipated levels of demand. We're still in the process of developing our operating plan, so our formal capacity guidance will come out when we report fourth-quarter earnings, but we currently expect our year-over-year system capacity be up approximately 1% in 2017. We expect full year 2017 domestic capacity to be flat while our international capacity is expected to be up approximately 3.5%. Our international growth is driven primarily by our Pacific entity as we annualize the new routes added in 2016. We'll also know more about our 2017 unit cost projections after we complete our operating plan, but as Doug noted, we now have the bulk of our cost increases behind us. As we look to 2017, we expect the full-year impact of our labor agreements will add approximately two points of CASM, but otherwise our core CASM growth should be around 2% on a very modest 1% growth in ASMs. And as Doug also noted, with the integration nearing completion, we will be able to begin the process of eliminating some redundancies in 2017, which will help our unit costs in 2018 and beyond. So in conclusion, we couldn't be more proud of more than 100,000 team members who continue to deliver outstanding results. We continue to make great progress integrating our airlines, most recently with our flight operating system cutover and we've already seen some positive results. We are also excited about the commercial initiatives our team is working on and looking forward to reporting on their continued success on future calls. Thanks again for your time this morning and with that I'll turn it over to Robert. Robert Isom Thanks Derek. Good morning to everyone. I appreciate that you're joining us. I would like to start out by thanking our 100,000 team members for their outstanding work during the quarter and I characterize this quarter as being one of operational and commercial challenges, but I would like to underscore positively that we have executed integration items exceptionally well. Despite all these challenges, our team's commitment to taking care of our customers and each other has never wavered. Some performance was challenging for both our employees and customers. The primary driver was inclement weather that seemed to settle over a number of our hubs throughout the summer, most notably Dallas or DFW. In addition we struggled to operate our expanded Los Angeles schedule reliably. primarily due to airport and facility constraints. We're working with [indiscernible] so that we will be better able to meet our customer's demands to fly American from Los Angeles going forward. I'm happy to report that our reliability has rebounded to new record levels across our system in September as a result of a number of factors and those trends have continued well into October and we expect that they will continue. Again I appreciate the efforts of our front-line team to take care of our customers throughout the summer and especially and most recently during Hurricane Matthew. We have successfully completed some major integration milestones over the past few months including a single flight operating system for our pilots dispatching aircraft and I am so appreciative of our 15,000 pilots the APA, our IT and flight teams for their efforts to ensure a seamless cutover. We've also put new uniforms on all of our employees. We have interim agreements with our fleet service and mechanic workgroups. Tentative agreements now with our flight crew training instructors and some engineers and once these tentative agreements have been ratified all American team members will be benefiting from pay increases that resulted from our merger. So much of what we're striving to accomplish going forward would be difficult to address without having the integration work completed and completed well. As I start to think about our plans for next year, there's good reason to believe that America will improve versus the industry and operations performance. We're taking a fresh look at how we schedule our aircraft reliability. Our 777 200 reconfigurations will be completed by summer 2017. Our 787 fleet has reached a critical mass allowing for easier recovery from off schedule ops and with a single flight operating system, our aircraft and pilots can now be used interchangeably instead of being managed as separate entities. We're also making big investments in service recovery and customer notification tools for passengers and employees that we'll continue to roll out next year. On the revenue front, our third quarter TRASM was down 2.2%, while the revenue environment is still challenging in certain areas of the world, we as -- we have observed improvements in many places. The third quarter was much better than the second quarter, so we continue to see improving trends. As Doug noted, in September we had positive year-over-year TRASM and PRASM and that's the first time this is has occurred since November of 2014 and we're seeing improving trends in cargo as well. September marked the first time since December 2014 that our monthly year-over-year cargo revenue has improved. Domestically consolidated PRASM was down 1.8%. This was our best result since the first quarter of 2015. We saw strength across the board with all hubs have a second derivative improvement. Los Angeles and DCA were top performers year-over-year. Internationally, we have lapped the dollar strengthening last year as well as declining international surcharges. Latin was our first entity to turn positive with PRASM up 1.8% for the quarter, driven by 25% year-over-year improvement in Brazil PRASM as capacity rationalized and the Real strengthened. In addition there was continued strength in Mexico. The Atlantic was our worst-performing international entity down 11.2%. The main drivers of performance are continued capacity increases, specifically for low-cost carriers, the devaluation of the British Pound as a result of the Brexit vote and lingering impacts from recent terrorist attacks. Across the Pacific, PRASM was down 10.5% on capacity increases of 28.7% with continued weakness in China due to excess capacity and growing into our new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Haneda, Sydney and Auckland. We're pleased to see corporate passenger demand holding up, driven by our domestic entity. In the third quarter, we saw increases in both absolute revenue and revenue share and we see similar trends developing in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we see some choppiness in the fourth quarter due to holiday shifts with September and January benefiting from traffic shifting from October and December. We expect November to be the strongest month of the quarter versus 2015. Regionally, the domestic fourth-quarter looks about the same as the third quarter due to holiday shifts. In Latin America we expect continued sequential improvement and low single-digit increase in PRASM. We expect the Pacific and Atlantic to remain challenging with low double-digit year-over-year PRASM declines And with that, we expect our fourth-quarter TRASM not PRASM, but the total TRASM to be down 1% to 3% year-over-year. We expect that our fourth quarter decline to be smaller than our third quarter decline, despite a more difficult fourth-quarter year-over-year comparison. As we look forward to 2017, we expect continued second derivative improvement in year-over-year TRASM performance and look forward to getting to positive TRASM in the first half of the year. In conclusion, it's an exciting time to be at American Airlines. We made a tremendous amount of progress over this past year with respect to integration, operational improvement and getting back on path to positive TRASM. All these important steps are critical to restoring American Airlines to its rightful industry-leading position. We have a lot of work left to do and we're confident we have the right plans, the right team in place to execute and we look forward to reporting back on future successes. And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin the question-and-answer session. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel Doug Parker Hey Joseph. Joseph DeNardi Hey Robert just a question on the decision to cut some capacity at our fourth quarter. How much of that was planned versus related to some of the operational challenges you're having at LA and then was that decision seen as an EPS accretive action or is that just kind driven by a focus on improving RASM? Robert Isom Thanks Joe I appreciate the question, but the capacity that we're planning for the fourth quarter is really a result of all plans and so there's not much that we would say is attributable to anything operationally. Joseph DeNardi Okay. And then was that -- was the idea to reduce capacity relative to their prior plan, just designed to improve RASM or was that seen as also beneficial to earnings, just trying to understand the pressure it put on CASM, are you expecting a better increase on the RASM side? Robert Isom Look the capacity we have out there we think best meets demand and ultimately we think that's margin accretive and we think we have the right schedule out there for the flying that we can do. Joseph DeNardi Okay. And then Derek, you mentioned again that you're carrying some excess liquidity as you get through this CapEx bubble that wraps up next year. What's normal liquidity for you guys look like once you get through that? Derek Kerr Well I think as we've said we can go down, our minimum number is going to be about 6.5. We do have some things coming up in 2018 with the pension payments, we've about $1.4 billion pension payment in '18 as we start going forward. So we need to look out all the way through that time period to make sure that we have cash levels at that point and we're very confident where we're at today and we're levels are at today. So I think we can take it down a little bit from here, but I want to make sure that we get through all of the aircraft purchases next year and then I think it gets into the -- as we said 6.5 is our minimum that we feel we can go down to and we’re significantly above that today, so we’ve opportunities to continue to return cash to our shareholders. Doug Parker And just -- this is Doug, just to add on to Derek, so the minimum is I think below that. It's a target and we’d like to keep that we think is a safe amount little bit more than our competitors. That’s what we do rather than what in exchange for having some higher leverage the way we protect ourselves as making sure we have lot more cash coming. So we have total cash balances of $6.4 billion. We're higher than that now and we’re investing heavily in the airline and our people. We will continue to do so because we’re investing for the future to the extent we continue to be well above that number, that’s we consider our excess cash and we return to our shareholders. Joseph DeNardi Great. Thank you. Operator Next we have Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay Thanks. Good morning. Doug Parker Good morning. Hunter Keay Hey this is a question for Don Casey. Don, I’m going to ask you a very generic question just to get us, I want to hear you talk and so feel free to go anywhere with this, but I’ll just say can you just tell us what you saw on the domestic yield environment as the quarter progressed and may be to understand as you talked about Dallas now that we’re lapping the right amendment, what’s happening in that market and I'll leave it at that. Just talk about Dallas and overall domestic yield thanks.  Don Casey On the domestic front as we went through the quarter, we saw improving near term yield. So yields start to improve across the domestic business starting in August and from a RASM perspective we saw improved yearend RASM build going back to April. As for Dallas in particular, in August the last tranche of the Southwest expansion for Dallas and when we look at the Dallas performance right now, it's really in line with performance across the rest of the system. Hunter Keay Good, thanks and then little more on debt Derek, Scott said you don't believe artificial debt targets. Your stock has been doing nicely, your RASM is getting better at a certain point here, people are going to start moving away from it if you're not, I think perceived to be taking a more assertive approach on your balance sheet. Again next three, six months as RASM gets better, that’s fine, but you’re running the risk of people transitioning to more quality stocks in the space if you will if you're not taking an assertive approach on debt. So, may be talk about rather than just talking about liquidity, let’s talk about debt holistically and is there any thoughts of providing making a slide that shows where you want to be on debt targets over the next, two three, four years because it works for Delta and I think it's a nice story to tell for some of the incremental long lease that might be all put off as everybody’s RASM gets better midpoint in next year. Thanks. Doug Parker Hey let me start. This is Doug, so -- and then Derek can provide details, but first off I would just, frankly we don’t agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do, but our view is the best thing for our shareholders is to ensure that we have sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn, but the cost of getting to or worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we're borrowing against aircraft as 3% doesn’t necessarily -- actually doesn’t seem to be that go in and of itself, doesn’t seem to be in our shareholder's best interest. So somewhat -- it somewhat surprised with shareholder with the people like you would push back on this, because we think we’re doing what’s best for our shareholders. At the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels this industry has never seen but consistent with what other industries do. We’re very bullish on our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investment. We are investing at levels that no airlines ever invested before. The aircraft monetization I talked about has now at aircraft levels that are at age levels that are well below our competitors something like around 10 years and falling for 16, 17 years and increasing for them and then investing on top of that something as Derek said $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airline. Those are good investments and we’re excited about those and those will provide returns for our shareholders. Those are long lived assets that we're not off spending it on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we’re not, we're doing what we think is right and we feel very good about that. That investment will now return for shareholders. Once we do that then we look to make sure we've paid down any high cost that we done that. Derek and his team has done a phenomenal job of getting to while we have a larger amount of debt in the balance sheet and appear the cost that debt is low and as we look to each -- the incremental decision by the way comes down to that. We’re adding airplanes as we do this monetization. Should we use our cash balance to pay for those aircrafts or should we avail ourselves of 3% debt and we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail ourselves of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target and we think the right thing to do with that is to return it to our shareholders, but the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance then others. That’s the cost of it, but it’s a much, much costly thing then paying -- then not availing yourself of low cost debt and the other point I want to make is even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash per aircraft we still have higher debt. It's going to be better assets.  When you have airplanes that are nine years old but somebody else with 17 years old, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets and they’re going to be here for a long time as are we and that’s what why we're doing this. So you're right. This is -- we believe we’re in the right spot. We’re very comfortable with our leverage. We’re very comfortable with the balance sheet and we’re doing the right thing for our shareholders. Hunter Keay Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker Hey, good morning everybody. Doug your pretax margins at now the lowest in the business, dropping below those of United for the first time in a long time, do you expect to remain the worst in the business? Doug Parker And that’s seasonal -- no is the answer, but I expect which you'll see in '17 is to do better than our competitors in terms of certainly year-over-year margins. You've seen it already in the RASM and that will continue into '17. You'll see on the cost front as Derek noted the reason the margins declined even though we’re having better RASM now of course is because our CASM is up more, that’s because we’ve gone and taken care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have in every workgroup, less than three years since the merger we now have everyone on new pays scale that reflect the they're doing for us and that’s increased our cost but they're well below. We had to do that. We're happy we did that. Our shareholders should be happy we did that but it's behind us now. We have one of those that was done midyear which is the TWI Derek talked about so that will have a year-over-year impact, but it's in the current cost structure and beyond that we haven't seen any sort of other cost increase, certainly over and above inflationary rates in the airline. So, I think what you’ll see as we go through '17 is better revenue PRASM improvement on a year-over-year basis and better cost performance as well. Jamie Baker Okay. I appreciated it and Robert I continue to purchase the absolute lowest fares that American intends to publish because I can. As I noted on Delta’s call I’m prohibited from doing so, when flying them because economy basic is rolled off. Can you give us an update on the timing and any potential earnings magnitude that you would associate with rolling out a similar ULCC matching de-contented product however you refereed to internally. Robert Isom Thanks Jamie so, basically we’ve been working on for some time and we’re on track. We’re prepared to launch at the end of this year, but right now our game plan is going to be hold off on that and to go and to start to roll out in January. This comes a little bit from my operations background when avoid the holidays and disruption to our folks and so we’re on track and ready to go, but any details on that and you’re going to have until we roll out and we're not at this time making any projections on revenue performance associated with the product. Jamie Baker In light of the no answer, can I just ask the inevitable question if you aggregate November, December and January on a domestic basis. will RASM be positive or negative? Don Casey This is Don I will answer that. Jamie Baker Hi Don. Don Casey But when we looked at the entire system, so not just domestic, but look at the entire system from November through January we would expect our overall TRASM performance to be flat to slightly positive. Jamie Baker Excellent, thank you everybody.  Doug Parker Thanks Jamie. Operator Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.  Rajeev Lalwani Hi, thanks for the time first question just in terms of the guide for 4Q how conservative is it just given what we saw the last quarter what are you assuming on the closing side and then any other assumptions that you can share with us would be great.  Don Casey This is Don again when we do the forecast we try and pick the midpoint and we did that again this quarter.  Derek Kerr Yeah, anyway Raj, I would just point out I mean there is improvement if we had 2.2% PRASM in the third quarter and we giving you 1 to 3 in -- midpoint is to then that’s improvement, slight improvement for us but fact in the fourth quarter year-over-year comp as far as in the third quarter, year-over-year comp is always calendar and having even this same performance third quarter, fourth quarter on year-over-year basis is improvement, it’s we believe our forecast highlights an improving trends is what we’re experiencing.  Doug Parker At that due to the holiday shifts, specific of the Christmas holiday shift we expect the impact of that on Q4 PRASM to be one point. Derek Kerr Which is moves into the first quarter.  Doug Parker It moves in the first quarter so, at a mid point or two absent the holiday shift there would be base business improvement point. Rajeev Lalwani Great and then in terms of the capacity growth for next year can you talk about just cadence through next year and then some color on the brick down by region I think you provided some color on Asia which is looking at maybe other parts of the world and then also how did you arrive at flat and domestic grows next year with underpinning that.  Derek Kerr Yeah, this is Derek but I think we’re going to have to hold up on that until we get to the we’re still working through it I mean that’s our projection right now as we’re doing our plan so when we get down to the fourth quarter call we’ll give regional and cadence by quarter by as of right now, we just have a full year number and we’re working through the plan so, we just have to wait till the next quarter for that.  Rajeev Lalwani Okay, may be just one question and I think you talked about growing a good amount in Asia can you may be just highlight why you are growing so much there is just give some of the process and figures that we saw and that relates to that.  Derek Kerr The growth that you see is really as a result of additions that we made this past year. This is we take a look into the next year it’s going to be, going into the services that we’ve put that we think that our network is well suited to support those routes and our customers demand the service there for serving the region in the long run and we’re in the right phase.  Rajeev Lalwani Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg Hi, hey good morning everybody just a couple here. On the credit card deal with the Master Card explicatively Derek I guess I miss that when the original press release came out I just, I know you had really long term relationship with Visa is there any sort of incremental benefit or with the numbers that you gave us and that was announced that also include moving over to MasterCard from Visa.  Derek Kerr That includes moving over to MasterCard. Mike Linenberg Okay. Great and then just my second question on for Bob, Robert we talked about basic economy and rolling that out in early 2017 I guess can you talk about the international premium economy which I believe is actually rolling out this week and how long it’s going to take to ramp up across your international system and what should think about the potential revenue upside from putting this product out across your fleet and by the when do you get it fully up in running.  Derek Kerr For international premium economy the great news is that we’re seeing as come out of on our 787, 900 deliveries which is a fantastic news and those ramp and we’ll have critical master to start selling right now you can buy into those seats which is good news as we get to the point of being able to offer consistently next year will be able to start selling the premium economy cap. Doug Parker Yeah, mike it’s a that we are doing the modifications we have to go through on all of our white body aircraft the ones that aren’t delivered with it. The one that of the biggest portion of them will start coming in '18 so, we’ll have all of those aircraft going through mod in '17. So, we will monetized those seats through probably MCE, the main cabin extra product that we have today until we get to the critical mass and then we’ll be able to put up roll out the premium economy so I think that it’s more of an '18 impact that is '17 impact due to having modify all of our white body aircraft for that product. Don Casey This is Don. I just add that we’ve also we’ve to actually create the infrastructure and say but sell the fourth cabin and that’s a big IT project that’s underway right now and then we’re expected to have that completed in early next year and we’ll start selling the fourth cabin in mid February for flights beginning of April.  Mike Linenberg When we think about the magnitude kind of the run rate on this, this is like a [$1.750 billion] type program on its up and running is that or to might just we had of the ballpark on that.  Derek Kerr Mike, we’ve given those numbers hundreds of millions of dollars, I think quite comfortable to seeing that, it’s a great product for our customers in addition we see correctly why we saw this is being able to look at our partners information be doing the similar planning as we -- and getting higher RASM because of this product it helps the number of ways we excited about it’s certainly as, it’s a meaningful impact to our customers and to our revenues.  Mike Linenberg And I’m looking for to it for as well. Thanks Doug. Derek Kerr Thanks Mike. Operator And our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker Thank you, operator. Hi guys thank you for the time here so, I have just a couple of questions. The first is do you have to make any changes in IT to accommodate the both the DoT issued yesterday with respect to on time performance specifically. Derek Kerr Perhaps we don’t know yet -- it is not material versus all the other stuff we have IT group doing in terms of integration otherwise there maybe something that, that’s not large as… Helane Becker Okay. And then my second question is when you think about your headcount I know you guys have talked about at being over stocked as you work through all the integration so as we look ahead to may be 2018 and there is I assume we’re going to reduce to -- and what’s like the normalize level we should be thinking about? Derek Kerr Let’s work through and give you the numbers overtime I’m not sure we know that number yet but we know is we do indeed have, because we’re still not fully integrated number of areas around the company where we not just more people with resources that we need in all sources of areas so, we will make sure, we do it in a way that’s as quickly as we can and also in way that’s takes care about employee is really important to us so. That’s a big project for us through 2017 I wouldn’t expect it would be able to yield major cost savings in 2017 because we still to be run, we are on good part of 2017 that’s a big focus of the teams efforts to move forwards to be sure but we are indeed and -- and team to make sure we don’t get to have one airline and still have the infrastructure of two. So we work through it as we know more let you know but that it's not significantly we’ve talked about it. It's something is going to be able to yield some nice cost improvements and it should part of why our cost are where they are right now because we're running through separate airlines in a lot of areas and we'll work through that as we go through 2017. Helane Becker Okay, and then just -- the other question I just had was with the Atlantic and your joint venture with BA and Iberia and the other carriers have you been able to think through what the right level of capacity has given the huge increase in capacity from what I would call low fare in other airlines on the North Atlantic this past summer and what it's likely to be next summer? Maybe too far away, but I’m sure you’re giving it some thought. Derek Kerr I am going to try and then Don can chime in if I am not, but we haven't cared for a lot of our capacity of course, capacity plans based upon others. What we know is while those other carriers are having an impact what we fly is incredibly important to American Airlines and don’t have any material plans to do anything other than what we’re doing right now and plan to continue to do so. It’s a huge part of our network and important part of our network and important to our customers and the relationship with BAs, Iberia is a very important one. So as capacity comes on from others of course, yields solve and we work through those things, but I don’t expect you'll see us just decide to we're the ones that you should be looking to impaired our capacity going. Don? Don Casey Yeah, I'll just add in the upcoming winter season, we’re actually reducing our capacity by 6% and so we are taking some action and those capacity reductions are focused on markets what are -- we face with structural challenges but where we have partners and we continued to maintain at capacity going forward.  Helane Becker Great, thank you for your help. Derek Kerr Thanks, Helane Operator And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth Hey, good morning. Nice to speak with you on a Thursday for changes it’s a good format. I just wanted a follow up to actually where Joe started the conversation on capacity if we look at this year I think you started out about 3% and we’re finishing up about a 140 basis points of that. Could you quantify how much of that was due to regional supply constrains and I wonder if you would willing to get specific on Republics restructuring. What were the aircraft you expected to be flying in the original plan that went away. Don Casey Yeah, Duane I think it would be hard for us to pick that out right now, but it's our reductions really result of not only a little bit due to regional supportability due to pilot concerns but also south American concerns and then adjustment throughout the system so, I think where we stand right now is what we need to be and we got the fleet and that network that’s meeting the demand we think that's out there. Derek Kerr In the reduction of course we're still increasing, it's not increasing our rate but at one point in the future, we forecast we would be -- so it’s not because of aircraft numbers, it's because of utilization of aircraft and we respond to demand. So that’s really what’s going on here going for the most part. We look out a few quarters and think where we may be based on the aircraft we have and what we have comment and then as we get closer and see what’s happening with demand, we may make schedule changes and that’s what's happened here. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. I may follow up on -- I thought you had mentioned some impact from Republic previously but I can follow-up… Don Casey Duane this is overall of the shortfall about a third of that comes from total regional issues some of that is of course republic, some of it is usually associated with pilots who fly it, other partner regional and our wholly owned as well. Robert Isom And Joe, this is Derek, we did put in our Q that we have reached agreement with Republic on our go-forward plan which did take out about 20-25 aircrafts out of the contract and so we reach that agreement with them obviously they still have a process to go through to get out of bankruptcy but our deal moving forward has reduced aircraft in we’re in pretty good job and was in where we’re at with the republic. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay, that’s great and then Robert I wanted to ask you a question kind of old or structure versus new or structure what were some of the less than optimal aspect of getting a network plan from the other side of the house and then you having deliver that from an operational perspective and I guess more importantly what are the implications of an engineer and that in a very flattering way of an engineer and now owning both of the network plan and ops. Don Casey Duane, thanks look, our company has been so focused on integration merger huge initiatives, that the adjustments that we made in terms of worst structure really design now that we’re getting past somebody of major integration milestones to start looking at how we can really optimize the running the company day-to-day and to do that we know that we got to collaborate and we all have to be focus on the same goals. And I think we gotten odd structure and fantastic people running each of the operating goods and they’re committed to doing that and so you know any difficulties we’ve had, I think we’re just going to be more well suited to collaborate, communicate and make sure that were all line going forward.  Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. I think you answered half of that but I appreciate the talking. Operator And our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins Good morning. Thanks for the time so, I guess just following up on that last question for moment Robert now that your new role has the strategy at all changed with the as far as the competition with you ULCCs and your markets and then as you look at your network today are there any specific items or projects now that you are in you new role that you look to sort of undertake over the next 12 months.  Derek Kerr So thanks for the question. Hey look I’ve been part of this management team since the -- go so, in terms of how we go to market and strategies that we’re intending to pursue I feel like I’ve done part of those and the direction that were isn’t going to change we’re going to be incredibly competitive with all commerce especially in our Hut and so you won’t see much of a change in terms of philosophy as we go to the marketplace and compete.  Yeah, in terms of going forward there is things we wanted to do, we wanted to certainly excel that one of them is running a fantastic airline one that is best in the business on all levels and that’s operational as well as revenue performance and certainly from the perspective of meeting customers’ expectations that’s going to require that we really engage all of our people in a way that we haven’t before and I do view going forward that one of the that primary point of emphasis that we’re going to make is involving all of our people and making sure that they are equipped and well trained and treated in a fashion where, they help us outperform the industry.  So from there is a lot of other things that we have going on, certainly we want to make sure that we have all of our forward looking’s strategies as alliance partners our network in the best fashion but it all leads to the same place which is having the best network to best people and best product for our customers.  Jack Atkins Okay. Great. Doug Parker Hey, Jack, its Doug that’s a great answer but also as well as much timing a little bit on the specifically on the ULCC where we said there is absolutely no change and we need we have to compete aggressively on price against here is like that and when they add place to our hub and we actually have a competitive advantage because we have so much connecting activity and the one game changer, may be a big -- but actually a certainly an improvement and how we can do that and still not, and still be as good for American Airlines is can be -- is basic economy and so that product we have in place we’ll allow us to do just that but not have the same amount of dilution we have to American Airlines. So the impact to the spirits of the frontiers will be the same. We've aggressively matched our prices, but since -- as we put that product in place it will have some attributes that some of our customers would rather don’t care the purchase or want to purchase other attributes for more and right now as we match pretty much, we’re not able to do that. So that will allow us to do what we’re doing today, continue to do what we’re doing today which as Robert says what we’re going to do, but also do it in a way that allows us to provide another more utility to our customers and give them a product in addition to the one with absolutely lowest fare. Jack Atkins Okay. Great. Thank you, Doug and Robert and I guess just as a follow-up question, it seems as though with whether it's cabin segmentation or international revenue opportunities or reducing redundancies in the organization over the next couple of years there is a huge revenue and cost opportunity at American which should drive significant profitability. And I’m just curious as you guys think about how to communicate that going forward, is there going to be may be an opportunity for us get from you guys detailed financial targets long term because I think that would really help folks to understand the earnings power here.  Doug Parker Okay, thanks for the comment. We’ll take it under advisement I understand the value that could provide, just know that I’ve been doing this way long and I’m often reluctant to do depends on how we define the targets, but what I don’t like doing is suggesting that we can predict the future in this business. It is in incredibly volatile. It will be volatile. I think it will be profitable. I think its dramatically changed the volatility hasn’t changed. So we sometimes are less comfortable than others trying to set things like margin targets, when we know that something effect those margins are outside of our control primarily the economy in fuel prices so, I tell you this. We couldn’t feel better about American Airlines' future and its financial future and what I also will tell you that based on what we think about the future and we this were extremely bullish on the American stock which is why we continue to purchase at level we do and because as we look out targets or no targets our projections are even in the difficult economic environments have this company be a nice profitable. And it doesn’t feel like our stock reflects that. So, we we’re happy to give you that guidance and let you go set your own numbers but what we do we’re management company is make sure we’re optimizing for the long term and we’re doing all those things but we’re remiss to trying to tell you that when we had those up it looks like to us and therefore here is what we will produce because we know there is a lot of volatility and what we’re able to produce and our job is to make sure that we can manage around that volatility. We can we’re excited about that but we're to see we can give you some more guidance we have in the past about longer term but just understand that’s our concern. Jack Atkins Okay, great. Thanks again for the time. Doug Parker Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates Thanks for taking my question. Derek Kerr Hi, Julie. Julie Yates Derek can you talk about the opportunities on the cost side now that the integration is largely behind you we seen structural cost reduction programs a few years after the other mergers then, when do you think American could announce something similar and where more specifically or some of the opportunities.  Don Casey Yeah, I think as we, we talked about on the call we’re going to be going through '17 from -- we have talked about having excess headcount in certain areas just duplication of work just because we're running two different airlines. That’s the primary area that we'll work on as we move forward. As we said in the call I think we’re going to look at stuff starting in '17 and it will start to affect us in '18. So, I think what we want to do is we’re going to go through the budget in '17, we going to see where everything is and then try to work with each one of the teams to figure out how we take that over the time period into '18, but I think it’s more as we talked about in '18 issue than it is a '17 issue. Mostly in efficiencies of trying to run through different airlines, all throughout the company is not just one point, it's all throughout the company as we've tried to get ourselves where we want to be from an airline and running the best airline we can.  Julie Yates Okay and then just a question on capacity in Latin America you guys have obviously taken a lot of capacity and you certainly seen the benefits of that today how are you thinking about presuming growth now that entity has turned and you worried about late in capacity coming back in next year.  Robert Isom Hey Julie its Robert its -- its wait and see we’re pleased with that the science of growth and we’re going to hold on to that for while and see where things go.  Julie Yates Okay and one final one Robert, when would you expect the trends at Atlantic PRASM 2 tends to flatten out.  Derek Kerr We do not see it in the foreseeable future, capacity in the first quarter, industry capacity is going to be a 7% and we don’t see signs of that abating and until that abates it's going to be hard to see a positive trajectory in the Atlantic. Julie Yates Okay. Thanks very much. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Doug Parker Hello Dan. Dan McKenzie Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just to be for Robert or Don, does the revenue guide factory in the potential loss of a coach here with Alaskan and how material could that impact be if it's lost? Robert Isom Revenue guidance does not and I don’t think if we didn’t change and so wouldn’t be - impact doing that… Dan McKenzie Okay. And then I guess Doug or Derek my question was on debt as well. So we all know absolute debt levels are higher than they have been historically but with respect to the underlying business I wondered if you could just help investors understand the leverage metrics relative to where they have been historically may be on an American standalone basis. So leverage metrics today relative to some average over some carried of time that make sense and as you look at those metrics as you feel comfortable about those metrics is that you expect profits to continue growing faster than the debt and wondered if you could just help us understand, what are those metrics look like under your stress test. Doug Parker Sure, thanks for bringing it back to because now when I said -- comfortable. What I meant was we’re comfortable where it is at this time because looking in the future what we expect to just see those metrics continue to improve and I want to suggest we comfortable keeping with there. Although will may be and but the reason we’re comfortable with them at this time is because what you say we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward. We have a very, we feel good about our certainly even on a very on in difficult economic times, stress testing against the recession about what our earnings would do and as we go forward. So, those that gives us comfort that we’re in a good spot right now and when things come up like 2% interest it seems to be an absolute brainer to us, the right thing to do is to take those debt on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and use that cash were appropriate. So that’s what we are comfortable about. What happens overtime I would expect and again without giving him targets and use you will see certainly that the metrics that are tied and coverage ratios for example that tie earnings to that levels you could see those better overtime, earnings better and then as their earnings get better and then debt get’s lower. We are also I should note while we are well head of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet and it will kind of time that we gotten that done and that’s to some future and you won’t see the decade and continued to so debt get’s lower overtime and earnings continued to even to our margins center stay where they are. You will see those numbers get better that’s why we’re comfortable where we are today. And we think we are today we because of the reason I said and we have the right structure in place. We too as a insurance material lot more cash than others but we think that’s a better way to do this for our shareholders and able to pay cash 3%. Dan McKenzie Thanks for the time. Operator Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi Thanks for the time and Doug just two follow up on some of your comments around aircraft age and I know you inherited a significant majority of your order book from your predecessor but if the long term plan to maintain the same relative age advantage over your competitors you have today because I think you doing so would imply much different longer term CapEx profile then allowing if lead edge… Doug Parker Yes, aircraft age is not a metric that we look at to measure versus our competitors I just point out where it is and but we don’t have goal to say we need to be below the other aircraft age but its noteworthy. But I think we will get to conversations about relative debt levels to point out how much stronger asset base is mine and the best way to communicate to point out how much younger our fleet is, it look it is a is absolutely customer advantage when you get one - new airplanes - there is no doubt and that is much better in flight product and you can tell the difference. And so we feel good about that and that you are right, the orders were in place and they’re coming and we’re taking them and but the bigger point that they trying to make here is these are if you look in the very near term, you may say 'Oh my gosh, they have always debt, these are 25 years assets and those airlines have 17 year old airplanes won't be able to have 42 year old airplanes, 25 years from now. So at some point my point is were ahead of them and suggesting they need to go spending almost not a capital very near term and but they’ll need to do something and we won’t have to at the point, the way that's worked. So anyway our goal is to make sure we have the absolute young as its nice when you are in the position but to the extent you want to look at relative debt levels, you need to look at the asset base. Our asset base is just tremendously more. Darryl Genovesi Great, thanks for that. And then I guess if I just ask you on or maybe Robert or whoever wants to comment, can you just give us some sense of how your view on your Phoenix hub is evolving given your recent emphasis on Los Angeles and the existing presence in Dallas? Robert Isom Thanks. Appreciate it. Phoenix hub does well for us. It serves the same purpose that we did it as over - since the start of the merger and it’s a great connecting half, it's got a growing metro area and its serving our network very well. Darryl Genovesi Great, thank you. Doug Parker International gateway that we -- and I’m looking to expand but they’re complimentary not… Operator And our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora Hi, good morning everyone. Just one question for Robert, I guess when I look at your on time performance they really start to lag both your network appear starting about six months ago or so. Is there a reason for this is anything going on with the integration that would have caused and I can imagine that it's all the LA issues that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And I know you mentioned solid corporate share earlier but have you heard anything from your corporate customers on this performance. Thanks. Robert Isom The answer in terms of corporate customers, the answer is no. We haven’t heard anything we’re performing very well as I said in my remarks with our corporate business. So in terms of the summer and the fall up, that’s really where I look at things and associated with the schedule were I think we just quite frankly we were pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer, we had issues in Los Angeles, we definitely had I think in order in amount of weather issues associated with the DFW and then Chevrolet in Miami and that was problematic. So it seem like we’re in a recovery phase a lot of during the summer. As I said before we have a lot of integration tools that we didn’t have that we will in the future and that is on building airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taking care of. One of the things you will note though is we continued to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance these your performance that’s something that we continued to see and I think that will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance and you'll us as well that our completion factor as we move from operating two systems and really three systems in regard to our pilots down to one that we got a chance to much, much better. So I'm optimistic of where we headed and if you take a look at where we at right now schedule reductions associated with the fall season with the changes to our Los Angeles operation. We are operating back at new record levels and that should continue and again as I said before all efforts are focused on making sure that we worked together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate lively and competitively with the best in business. Andrew Didora Great, thank you. Operator And that ends the analyst questions. We will now take the questions from media. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Andrea Ahles Hello good morning. I would like to follow up a little bit on Helane Becker's question regarding the possibility reducing headcount and how that might be done in 2017. Are you looking at actually doing sort of any lay off reduction in force particularly headquarters where you may have overlapping function as you operate, as you go from operating two lines down into one can you give a little more color or detail on that. Doug Parker Sure, absolutely not, but glad you asked. We made it sound that way. We have through pockets of the airline in different groups we will have, we have because we're running two airlines people that are -- where we have more people we elevate other one. But we will manage that over time through attrition. If it makes sense, if it's a labor group or layouts whatever works for our people to make sure we do that. We don't have any intention nor do we care to go through like you described, we'll do this in a way that works for our team. Andrea Ahles All right. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News Mary Schlangenstein Hi. So I want to follow-up on Andrew's question, do you guys have some sense of the number of physicians that you're talking about that you have redundancy across your workforce. Doug Parker Nothing we can talk about yet. Again this is more of a beyond 2017 initiative. We're going to do the work through 2017. We still do have two airlines to our customers we know, but we still have two fleets. So it's not integrated. While we have that going on, we can't do any of this work what we never did in 2017 to figure out where it is and as we know more, we'll let people know. The good news in this is we have regular attrition rights and we have ways to -- we let people look to retire early and we'll work through those things as it becomes an issue. Right now we're just -- the reason we mentioned it is simply because it's important to the analyst community to understand that that will be something that comes beyond 2017. Mary Schlangenstein Right. So you will only consider things like early retirements, buyouts to know involuntary furloughs is what you're saying. Doug Parker Yes. As we sit here today that's what I speak it's correct. Conditions can change and also I want to make this sound like some enormous number of people. So we have pockets of people throughout the organization and as I said and we will work through to make sure this works out for those who are either looking to leave or want to leave on their own as they -- as we have natural attrition with more places. Mary Schlangenstein Yes. Doug Parker So this is nothing about furloughs and layoffs, all about the fact that as you move from two airlines to truly one airline, we will be able to get some cost efficiencies. Mary Schlangenstein Great. Thank you very much. Operator Next we have Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell Hi thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a bit more about the premium economy roll out on the rest of the wide body fleet. You outlined target of getting it done in 2017. I wanted to with the business class roll out that ended up being delayed. How do you plan to achieve the roll out in 2017? Robert Isom So Edward the premium economy is actually going to go on our A330 200 fleet, the 777-200s, 777-300s and then our 787 fleet, and as we have said 787-9s are starting now and as Don mentioned, we should have for sale in terms of a different class of service next year, but reconfigurations are going to take place over the course of the next really 18 months, 24 months. So we're not going to be ready along all those fleets until June of 2018. Edward Russell Okay. Got it thank you and how many roughly, how many do you forecast the reduction in number of economies seats on these aircrafts as you make the modifications or you assume they're going to be neutral? Robert Isom I think we're talking about a row generally. I think so that will vary on different aircraft types, but that should be about the way it rolls out. Edward Russell About the economy, thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Conor Shine with Dallas Morning News. Doug Parker Hi Conor. Conor Shine Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the improving TRASM trend. What are the kind of the factors that are driving that improvement? Is it just the reduction in capacity growth going forward or are there other elements to that? Doug Parker Don do you want to take? Don Casey Sure, there are two areas that really kind of driving the growth. One is Latin American and Latin American both Brazil where we've seen 25% increase in the revenue year-over-year, Mexico is performing strongly and we got positive revenue growth in Mexico and Venezuela is contributing to overall unit revenue growth as well. Domestic business the trend there really has been positive. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen close in yields strength. We've also seen a stabilized pricing environment that's been pretty tumultuous this year but as of late July I can even doubt that when we look at the domestic business from O&D perspective we're seeing kind of the best and strongest yield performance in connecting in oil markets and domestic business which ties a little bit back my earlier comments on pricing. And also we're seeing the benefits now of the credit card deal that we did in the second quarter as well. Conor Shine Good. Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Ted Reed with The Street. Ted Reed Thank you. I just had a couple questions about Latin America, some just answered, but are these gains in Latin America are they sustainable? How much of an edge did they give you over your competitors with less presence in Latin America and also when are you going to be able to make money in Cuba and will this be a factor in improving PRASM in Latin America or will it be will be less valuable there. Don Casey This is Don again, when we look at the trends in Latin America, we would expect Brazil is a big factor obviously in the overall result and we're expecting our performance in Brazil in the fourth quarter to be better materially better than the performance in the third quarter. So we think our performance in Latin America overall is going to continue to get that. Now for Cuba, I think everything is struggling a little bit in terms of selling in Cuba, there are a lot of restrictions that are still in place that made it difficult to sell. Right now we're seeing greatest strength in terms of forward-booking in the Havana markets where we've had our long presence with our charter operation. But I think Cuba is going to be a bit of a long road I think. Doug Parker We're in for the long haul. It's not something we didn't expect. This is really a new market and so at any rate we're excited to be the largest carrier there. We're committed to Cuba and making it work and we'll work through the startup to get into the point where eventually where we all expect we'll be. Excited about the start of Havana on November 30. Ted Reed All right. Quickly most I assume the vast majority of sales are in the U.S. in Miami. Doug Parker Yes they are. Ted Reed All right. Thank you. Operator And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Cravens for any additional or closing remarks. Doug Parker This is Doug. Thanks everybody. Again look the story to this from my perspective listening to all this is you know is the team when we did this merger less than three years ago the biggest questions we get on this call was concerns about our ability to manage the integration and I couldn’t be more pleased with the work the team has done to get through flawlessly things like PSS and this is now five. So the delays here has helped us has managed us as a full team effort which is why it's so hard. It takes cross functional work when people are trying to actually do their full jobs there. So we're elided that that concern we've been able to take off your list of concerns and that's important but what is more important about is it shows what a great team we have here and the things we can do and now with much of that work behind not all of it but much of it behind us, we are extremely excited about everything that we have going on particularly the investments we are making in our people and our product that will accrue to our customers and the upside that provides us but we're in this for the long-term, we're excited about the long term and we appreciate your support thanks.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel Doug Parker Hey Joseph. Joseph DeNardi Hey Robert just a question on the decision to cut some capacity at our fourth quarter. How much of that was planned versus related to some of the operational challenges you're having at LA and then was that decision seen as an EPS accretive action or is that just kind driven by a focus on improving RASM? Robert Isom Thanks Joe I appreciate the question, but the capacity that we're planning for the fourth quarter is really a result of all plans and so there's not much that we would say is attributable to anything operationally. Joseph DeNardi Okay. And then was that -- was the idea to reduce capacity relative to their prior plan, just designed to improve RASM or was that seen as also beneficial to earnings, just trying to understand the pressure it put on CASM, are you expecting a better increase on the RASM side? Robert Isom Look the capacity we have out there we think best meets demand and ultimately we think that's margin accretive and we think we have the right schedule out there for the flying that we can do. Joseph DeNardi Okay. And then Derek, you mentioned again that you're carrying some excess liquidity as you get through this CapEx bubble that wraps up next year. What's normal liquidity for you guys look like once you get through that? Derek Kerr Well I think as we've said we can go down, our minimum number is going to be about 6.5. We do have some things coming up in 2018 with the pension payments, we've about $1.4 billion pension payment in '18 as we start going forward. So we need to look out all the way through that time period to make sure that we have cash levels at that point and we're very confident where we're at today and we're levels are at today. So I think we can take it down a little bit from here, but I want to make sure that we get through all of the aircraft purchases next year and then I think it gets into the -- as we said 6.5 is our minimum that we feel we can go down to and we’re significantly above that today, so we’ve opportunities to continue to return cash to our shareholders. Doug Parker And just -- this is Doug, just to add on to Derek, so the minimum is I think below that. It's a target and we’d like to keep that we think is a safe amount little bit more than our competitors. That’s what we do rather than what in exchange for having some higher leverage the way we protect ourselves as making sure we have lot more cash coming. So we have total cash balances of $6.4 billion. We're higher than that now and we’re investing heavily in the airline and our people. We will continue to do so because we’re investing for the future to the extent we continue to be well above that number, that’s we consider our excess cash and we return to our shareholders. Joseph DeNardi Great. Thank you. Operator Next we have Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Hunter Keay Thanks. Good morning. Doug Parker Good morning. Hunter Keay Hey this is a question for Don Casey. Don, I’m going to ask you a very generic question just to get us, I want to hear you talk and so feel free to go anywhere with this, but I’ll just say can you just tell us what you saw on the domestic yield environment as the quarter progressed and may be to understand as you talked about Dallas now that we’re lapping the right amendment, what’s happening in that market and I'll leave it at that. Just talk about Dallas and overall domestic yield thanks.  Don Casey On the domestic front as we went through the quarter, we saw improving near term yield. So yields start to improve across the domestic business starting in August and from a RASM perspective we saw improved yearend RASM build going back to April. As for Dallas in particular, in August the last tranche of the Southwest expansion for Dallas and when we look at the Dallas performance right now, it's really in line with performance across the rest of the system. Hunter Keay Good, thanks and then little more on debt Derek, Scott said you don't believe artificial debt targets. Your stock has been doing nicely, your RASM is getting better at a certain point here, people are going to start moving away from it if you're not, I think perceived to be taking a more assertive approach on your balance sheet. Again next three, six months as RASM gets better, that’s fine, but you’re running the risk of people transitioning to more quality stocks in the space if you will if you're not taking an assertive approach on debt. So, may be talk about rather than just talking about liquidity, let’s talk about debt holistically and is there any thoughts of providing making a slide that shows where you want to be on debt targets over the next, two three, four years because it works for Delta and I think it's a nice story to tell for some of the incremental long lease that might be all put off as everybody’s RASM gets better midpoint in next year. Thanks. Doug Parker Hey let me start. This is Doug, so -- and then Derek can provide details, but first off I would just, frankly we don’t agree with the premise and shareholders can make their own decisions obviously based upon what we do, but our view is the best thing for our shareholders is to ensure that we have sufficient amount of liquidity to withstand any sort of downturn, but the cost of getting to or worrying about credit ratings is in a business where we're borrowing against aircraft as 3% doesn’t necessarily -- actually doesn’t seem to be that go in and of itself, doesn’t seem to be in our shareholder's best interest. So somewhat -- it somewhat surprised with shareholder with the people like you would push back on this, because we think we’re doing what’s best for our shareholders. At the end of the day, we're producing -- we are producing profits at levels this industry has never seen but consistent with what other industries do. We’re very bullish on our ability to continue doing that over time. As we do so, the first thing we do is invest back in our company. This company needs a good bit of investment. We are investing at levels that no airlines ever invested before. The aircraft monetization I talked about has now at aircraft levels that are at age levels that are well below our competitors something like around 10 years and falling for 16, 17 years and increasing for them and then investing on top of that something as Derek said $1.5 billion next year on improvements in the airline. Those are good investments and we’re excited about those and those will provide returns for our shareholders. Those are long lived assets that we're not off spending it on ancillary businesses or trying to do something we’re not, we're doing what we think is right and we feel very good about that. That investment will now return for shareholders. Once we do that then we look to make sure we've paid down any high cost that we done that. Derek and his team has done a phenomenal job of getting to while we have a larger amount of debt in the balance sheet and appear the cost that debt is low and as we look to each -- the incremental decision by the way comes down to that. We’re adding airplanes as we do this monetization. Should we use our cash balance to pay for those aircrafts or should we avail ourselves of 3% debt and we think the best thing for our shareholders is to avail ourselves of the 3% debt. That leaves us with cash balances that are in excess of the target and we think the right thing to do with that is to return it to our shareholders, but the way we protect ourselves is having a much higher liquidity balance then others. That’s the cost of it, but it’s a much, much costly thing then paying -- then not availing yourself of low cost debt and the other point I want to make is even if we did those things, even if we started paying cash per aircraft we still have higher debt. It's going to be better assets.  When you have airplanes that are nine years old but somebody else with 17 years old, you're going to have higher debt because you have much better assets and they’re going to be here for a long time as are we and that’s what why we're doing this. So you're right. This is -- we believe we’re in the right spot. We’re very comfortable with our leverage. We’re very comfortable with the balance sheet and we’re doing the right thing for our shareholders. Hunter Keay Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker Hey, good morning everybody. Doug your pretax margins at now the lowest in the business, dropping below those of United for the first time in a long time, do you expect to remain the worst in the business? Doug Parker And that’s seasonal -- no is the answer, but I expect which you'll see in '17 is to do better than our competitors in terms of certainly year-over-year margins. You've seen it already in the RASM and that will continue into '17. You'll see on the cost front as Derek noted the reason the margins declined even though we’re having better RASM now of course is because our CASM is up more, that’s because we’ve gone and taken care of our people faster and gotten ourselves to a point where we have in every workgroup, less than three years since the merger we now have everyone on new pays scale that reflect the they're doing for us and that’s increased our cost but they're well below. We had to do that. We're happy we did that. Our shareholders should be happy we did that but it's behind us now. We have one of those that was done midyear which is the TWI Derek talked about so that will have a year-over-year impact, but it's in the current cost structure and beyond that we haven't seen any sort of other cost increase, certainly over and above inflationary rates in the airline. So, I think what you’ll see as we go through '17 is better revenue PRASM improvement on a year-over-year basis and better cost performance as well. Jamie Baker Okay. I appreciated it and Robert I continue to purchase the absolute lowest fares that American intends to publish because I can. As I noted on Delta’s call I’m prohibited from doing so, when flying them because economy basic is rolled off. Can you give us an update on the timing and any potential earnings magnitude that you would associate with rolling out a similar ULCC matching de-contented product however you refereed to internally. Robert Isom Thanks Jamie so, basically we’ve been working on for some time and we’re on track. We’re prepared to launch at the end of this year, but right now our game plan is going to be hold off on that and to go and to start to roll out in January. This comes a little bit from my operations background when avoid the holidays and disruption to our folks and so we’re on track and ready to go, but any details on that and you’re going to have until we roll out and we're not at this time making any projections on revenue performance associated with the product. Jamie Baker In light of the no answer, can I just ask the inevitable question if you aggregate November, December and January on a domestic basis. will RASM be positive or negative? Don Casey This is Don I will answer that. Jamie Baker Hi Don. Don Casey But when we looked at the entire system, so not just domestic, but look at the entire system from November through January we would expect our overall TRASM performance to be flat to slightly positive. Jamie Baker Excellent, thank you everybody.  Doug Parker Thanks Jamie. Operator Our next question comes from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley.  Rajeev Lalwani Hi, thanks for the time first question just in terms of the guide for 4Q how conservative is it just given what we saw the last quarter what are you assuming on the closing side and then any other assumptions that you can share with us would be great.  Don Casey This is Don again when we do the forecast we try and pick the midpoint and we did that again this quarter.  Derek Kerr Yeah, anyway Raj, I would just point out I mean there is improvement if we had 2.2% PRASM in the third quarter and we giving you 1 to 3 in -- midpoint is to then that’s improvement, slight improvement for us but fact in the fourth quarter year-over-year comp as far as in the third quarter, year-over-year comp is always calendar and having even this same performance third quarter, fourth quarter on year-over-year basis is improvement, it’s we believe our forecast highlights an improving trends is what we’re experiencing.  Doug Parker At that due to the holiday shifts, specific of the Christmas holiday shift we expect the impact of that on Q4 PRASM to be one point. Derek Kerr Which is moves into the first quarter.  Doug Parker It moves in the first quarter so, at a mid point or two absent the holiday shift there would be base business improvement point. Rajeev Lalwani Great and then in terms of the capacity growth for next year can you talk about just cadence through next year and then some color on the brick down by region I think you provided some color on Asia which is looking at maybe other parts of the world and then also how did you arrive at flat and domestic grows next year with underpinning that.  Derek Kerr Yeah, this is Derek but I think we’re going to have to hold up on that until we get to the we’re still working through it I mean that’s our projection right now as we’re doing our plan so when we get down to the fourth quarter call we’ll give regional and cadence by quarter by as of right now, we just have a full year number and we’re working through the plan so, we just have to wait till the next quarter for that.  Rajeev Lalwani Okay, may be just one question and I think you talked about growing a good amount in Asia can you may be just highlight why you are growing so much there is just give some of the process and figures that we saw and that relates to that.  Derek Kerr The growth that you see is really as a result of additions that we made this past year. This is we take a look into the next year it’s going to be, going into the services that we’ve put that we think that our network is well suited to support those routes and our customers demand the service there for serving the region in the long run and we’re in the right phase.  Rajeev Lalwani Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Mike Linenberg Hi, hey good morning everybody just a couple here. On the credit card deal with the Master Card explicatively Derek I guess I miss that when the original press release came out I just, I know you had really long term relationship with Visa is there any sort of incremental benefit or with the numbers that you gave us and that was announced that also include moving over to MasterCard from Visa.  Derek Kerr That includes moving over to MasterCard. Mike Linenberg Okay. Great and then just my second question on for Bob, Robert we talked about basic economy and rolling that out in early 2017 I guess can you talk about the international premium economy which I believe is actually rolling out this week and how long it’s going to take to ramp up across your international system and what should think about the potential revenue upside from putting this product out across your fleet and by the when do you get it fully up in running.  Derek Kerr For international premium economy the great news is that we’re seeing as come out of on our 787, 900 deliveries which is a fantastic news and those ramp and we’ll have critical master to start selling right now you can buy into those seats which is good news as we get to the point of being able to offer consistently next year will be able to start selling the premium economy cap. Doug Parker Yeah, mike it’s a that we are doing the modifications we have to go through on all of our white body aircraft the ones that aren’t delivered with it. The one that of the biggest portion of them will start coming in '18 so, we’ll have all of those aircraft going through mod in '17. So, we will monetized those seats through probably MCE, the main cabin extra product that we have today until we get to the critical mass and then we’ll be able to put up roll out the premium economy so I think that it’s more of an '18 impact that is '17 impact due to having modify all of our white body aircraft for that product. Don Casey This is Don. I just add that we’ve also we’ve to actually create the infrastructure and say but sell the fourth cabin and that’s a big IT project that’s underway right now and then we’re expected to have that completed in early next year and we’ll start selling the fourth cabin in mid February for flights beginning of April.  Mike Linenberg When we think about the magnitude kind of the run rate on this, this is like a [$1.750 billion] type program on its up and running is that or to might just we had of the ballpark on that.  Derek Kerr Mike, we’ve given those numbers hundreds of millions of dollars, I think quite comfortable to seeing that, it’s a great product for our customers in addition we see correctly why we saw this is being able to look at our partners information be doing the similar planning as we -- and getting higher RASM because of this product it helps the number of ways we excited about it’s certainly as, it’s a meaningful impact to our customers and to our revenues.  Mike Linenberg And I’m looking for to it for as well. Thanks Doug. Derek Kerr Thanks Mike. Operator And our next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen and Company. Helane Becker Thank you, operator. Hi guys thank you for the time here so, I have just a couple of questions. The first is do you have to make any changes in IT to accommodate the both the DoT issued yesterday with respect to on time performance specifically. Derek Kerr Perhaps we don’t know yet -- it is not material versus all the other stuff we have IT group doing in terms of integration otherwise there maybe something that, that’s not large as… Helane Becker Okay. And then my second question is when you think about your headcount I know you guys have talked about at being over stocked as you work through all the integration so as we look ahead to may be 2018 and there is I assume we’re going to reduce to -- and what’s like the normalize level we should be thinking about? Derek Kerr Let’s work through and give you the numbers overtime I’m not sure we know that number yet but we know is we do indeed have, because we’re still not fully integrated number of areas around the company where we not just more people with resources that we need in all sources of areas so, we will make sure, we do it in a way that’s as quickly as we can and also in way that’s takes care about employee is really important to us so. That’s a big project for us through 2017 I wouldn’t expect it would be able to yield major cost savings in 2017 because we still to be run, we are on good part of 2017 that’s a big focus of the teams efforts to move forwards to be sure but we are indeed and -- and team to make sure we don’t get to have one airline and still have the infrastructure of two. So we work through it as we know more let you know but that it's not significantly we’ve talked about it. It's something is going to be able to yield some nice cost improvements and it should part of why our cost are where they are right now because we're running through separate airlines in a lot of areas and we'll work through that as we go through 2017. Helane Becker Okay, and then just -- the other question I just had was with the Atlantic and your joint venture with BA and Iberia and the other carriers have you been able to think through what the right level of capacity has given the huge increase in capacity from what I would call low fare in other airlines on the North Atlantic this past summer and what it's likely to be next summer? Maybe too far away, but I’m sure you’re giving it some thought. Derek Kerr I am going to try and then Don can chime in if I am not, but we haven't cared for a lot of our capacity of course, capacity plans based upon others. What we know is while those other carriers are having an impact what we fly is incredibly important to American Airlines and don’t have any material plans to do anything other than what we’re doing right now and plan to continue to do so. It’s a huge part of our network and important part of our network and important to our customers and the relationship with BAs, Iberia is a very important one. So as capacity comes on from others of course, yields solve and we work through those things, but I don’t expect you'll see us just decide to we're the ones that you should be looking to impaired our capacity going. Don? Don Casey Yeah, I'll just add in the upcoming winter season, we’re actually reducing our capacity by 6% and so we are taking some action and those capacity reductions are focused on markets what are -- we face with structural challenges but where we have partners and we continued to maintain at capacity going forward.  Helane Becker Great, thank you for your help. Derek Kerr Thanks, Helane Operator And our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth Hey, good morning. Nice to speak with you on a Thursday for changes it’s a good format. I just wanted a follow up to actually where Joe started the conversation on capacity if we look at this year I think you started out about 3% and we’re finishing up about a 140 basis points of that. Could you quantify how much of that was due to regional supply constrains and I wonder if you would willing to get specific on Republics restructuring. What were the aircraft you expected to be flying in the original plan that went away. Don Casey Yeah, Duane I think it would be hard for us to pick that out right now, but it's our reductions really result of not only a little bit due to regional supportability due to pilot concerns but also south American concerns and then adjustment throughout the system so, I think where we stand right now is what we need to be and we got the fleet and that network that’s meeting the demand we think that's out there. Derek Kerr In the reduction of course we're still increasing, it's not increasing our rate but at one point in the future, we forecast we would be -- so it’s not because of aircraft numbers, it's because of utilization of aircraft and we respond to demand. So that’s really what’s going on here going for the most part. We look out a few quarters and think where we may be based on the aircraft we have and what we have comment and then as we get closer and see what’s happening with demand, we may make schedule changes and that’s what's happened here. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. I may follow up on -- I thought you had mentioned some impact from Republic previously but I can follow-up… Don Casey Duane this is overall of the shortfall about a third of that comes from total regional issues some of that is of course republic, some of it is usually associated with pilots who fly it, other partner regional and our wholly owned as well. Robert Isom And Joe, this is Derek, we did put in our Q that we have reached agreement with Republic on our go-forward plan which did take out about 20-25 aircrafts out of the contract and so we reach that agreement with them obviously they still have a process to go through to get out of bankruptcy but our deal moving forward has reduced aircraft in we’re in pretty good job and was in where we’re at with the republic. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay, that’s great and then Robert I wanted to ask you a question kind of old or structure versus new or structure what were some of the less than optimal aspect of getting a network plan from the other side of the house and then you having deliver that from an operational perspective and I guess more importantly what are the implications of an engineer and that in a very flattering way of an engineer and now owning both of the network plan and ops. Don Casey Duane, thanks look, our company has been so focused on integration merger huge initiatives, that the adjustments that we made in terms of worst structure really design now that we’re getting past somebody of major integration milestones to start looking at how we can really optimize the running the company day-to-day and to do that we know that we got to collaborate and we all have to be focus on the same goals. And I think we gotten odd structure and fantastic people running each of the operating goods and they’re committed to doing that and so you know any difficulties we’ve had, I think we’re just going to be more well suited to collaborate, communicate and make sure that were all line going forward.  Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. I think you answered half of that but I appreciate the talking. Operator And our next question comes from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins Good morning. Thanks for the time so, I guess just following up on that last question for moment Robert now that your new role has the strategy at all changed with the as far as the competition with you ULCCs and your markets and then as you look at your network today are there any specific items or projects now that you are in you new role that you look to sort of undertake over the next 12 months.  Derek Kerr So thanks for the question. Hey look I’ve been part of this management team since the -- go so, in terms of how we go to market and strategies that we’re intending to pursue I feel like I’ve done part of those and the direction that were isn’t going to change we’re going to be incredibly competitive with all commerce especially in our Hut and so you won’t see much of a change in terms of philosophy as we go to the marketplace and compete.  Yeah, in terms of going forward there is things we wanted to do, we wanted to certainly excel that one of them is running a fantastic airline one that is best in the business on all levels and that’s operational as well as revenue performance and certainly from the perspective of meeting customers’ expectations that’s going to require that we really engage all of our people in a way that we haven’t before and I do view going forward that one of the that primary point of emphasis that we’re going to make is involving all of our people and making sure that they are equipped and well trained and treated in a fashion where, they help us outperform the industry.  So from there is a lot of other things that we have going on, certainly we want to make sure that we have all of our forward looking’s strategies as alliance partners our network in the best fashion but it all leads to the same place which is having the best network to best people and best product for our customers.  Jack Atkins Okay. Great. Doug Parker Hey, Jack, its Doug that’s a great answer but also as well as much timing a little bit on the specifically on the ULCC where we said there is absolutely no change and we need we have to compete aggressively on price against here is like that and when they add place to our hub and we actually have a competitive advantage because we have so much connecting activity and the one game changer, may be a big -- but actually a certainly an improvement and how we can do that and still not, and still be as good for American Airlines is can be -- is basic economy and so that product we have in place we’ll allow us to do just that but not have the same amount of dilution we have to American Airlines. So the impact to the spirits of the frontiers will be the same. We've aggressively matched our prices, but since -- as we put that product in place it will have some attributes that some of our customers would rather don’t care the purchase or want to purchase other attributes for more and right now as we match pretty much, we’re not able to do that. So that will allow us to do what we’re doing today, continue to do what we’re doing today which as Robert says what we’re going to do, but also do it in a way that allows us to provide another more utility to our customers and give them a product in addition to the one with absolutely lowest fare. Jack Atkins Okay. Great. Thank you, Doug and Robert and I guess just as a follow-up question, it seems as though with whether it's cabin segmentation or international revenue opportunities or reducing redundancies in the organization over the next couple of years there is a huge revenue and cost opportunity at American which should drive significant profitability. And I’m just curious as you guys think about how to communicate that going forward, is there going to be may be an opportunity for us get from you guys detailed financial targets long term because I think that would really help folks to understand the earnings power here.  Doug Parker Okay, thanks for the comment. We’ll take it under advisement I understand the value that could provide, just know that I’ve been doing this way long and I’m often reluctant to do depends on how we define the targets, but what I don’t like doing is suggesting that we can predict the future in this business. It is in incredibly volatile. It will be volatile. I think it will be profitable. I think its dramatically changed the volatility hasn’t changed. So we sometimes are less comfortable than others trying to set things like margin targets, when we know that something effect those margins are outside of our control primarily the economy in fuel prices so, I tell you this. We couldn’t feel better about American Airlines' future and its financial future and what I also will tell you that based on what we think about the future and we this were extremely bullish on the American stock which is why we continue to purchase at level we do and because as we look out targets or no targets our projections are even in the difficult economic environments have this company be a nice profitable. And it doesn’t feel like our stock reflects that. So, we we’re happy to give you that guidance and let you go set your own numbers but what we do we’re management company is make sure we’re optimizing for the long term and we’re doing all those things but we’re remiss to trying to tell you that when we had those up it looks like to us and therefore here is what we will produce because we know there is a lot of volatility and what we’re able to produce and our job is to make sure that we can manage around that volatility. We can we’re excited about that but we're to see we can give you some more guidance we have in the past about longer term but just understand that’s our concern. Jack Atkins Okay, great. Thanks again for the time. Doug Parker Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Julie Yates with Credit Suisse. Julie Yates Thanks for taking my question. Derek Kerr Hi, Julie. Julie Yates Derek can you talk about the opportunities on the cost side now that the integration is largely behind you we seen structural cost reduction programs a few years after the other mergers then, when do you think American could announce something similar and where more specifically or some of the opportunities.  Don Casey Yeah, I think as we, we talked about on the call we’re going to be going through '17 from -- we have talked about having excess headcount in certain areas just duplication of work just because we're running two different airlines. That’s the primary area that we'll work on as we move forward. As we said in the call I think we’re going to look at stuff starting in '17 and it will start to affect us in '18. So, I think what we want to do is we’re going to go through the budget in '17, we going to see where everything is and then try to work with each one of the teams to figure out how we take that over the time period into '18, but I think it’s more as we talked about in '18 issue than it is a '17 issue. Mostly in efficiencies of trying to run through different airlines, all throughout the company is not just one point, it's all throughout the company as we've tried to get ourselves where we want to be from an airline and running the best airline we can.  Julie Yates Okay and then just a question on capacity in Latin America you guys have obviously taken a lot of capacity and you certainly seen the benefits of that today how are you thinking about presuming growth now that entity has turned and you worried about late in capacity coming back in next year.  Robert Isom Hey Julie its Robert its -- its wait and see we’re pleased with that the science of growth and we’re going to hold on to that for while and see where things go.  Julie Yates Okay and one final one Robert, when would you expect the trends at Atlantic PRASM 2 tends to flatten out.  Derek Kerr We do not see it in the foreseeable future, capacity in the first quarter, industry capacity is going to be a 7% and we don’t see signs of that abating and until that abates it's going to be hard to see a positive trajectory in the Atlantic. Julie Yates Okay. Thanks very much. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Doug Parker Hello Dan. Dan McKenzie Good morning guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I guess just to be for Robert or Don, does the revenue guide factory in the potential loss of a coach here with Alaskan and how material could that impact be if it's lost? Robert Isom Revenue guidance does not and I don’t think if we didn’t change and so wouldn’t be - impact doing that… Dan McKenzie Okay. And then I guess Doug or Derek my question was on debt as well. So we all know absolute debt levels are higher than they have been historically but with respect to the underlying business I wondered if you could just help investors understand the leverage metrics relative to where they have been historically may be on an American standalone basis. So leverage metrics today relative to some average over some carried of time that make sense and as you look at those metrics as you feel comfortable about those metrics is that you expect profits to continue growing faster than the debt and wondered if you could just help us understand, what are those metrics look like under your stress test. Doug Parker Sure, thanks for bringing it back to because now when I said -- comfortable. What I meant was we’re comfortable where it is at this time because looking in the future what we expect to just see those metrics continue to improve and I want to suggest we comfortable keeping with there. Although will may be and but the reason we’re comfortable with them at this time is because what you say we have very good line of sight as to what our capital requirements are going forward. We have a very, we feel good about our certainly even on a very on in difficult economic times, stress testing against the recession about what our earnings would do and as we go forward. So, those that gives us comfort that we’re in a good spot right now and when things come up like 2% interest it seems to be an absolute brainer to us, the right thing to do is to take those debt on rather than using cash to pay airplanes and use that cash were appropriate. So that’s what we are comfortable about. What happens overtime I would expect and again without giving him targets and use you will see certainly that the metrics that are tied and coverage ratios for example that tie earnings to that levels you could see those better overtime, earnings better and then as their earnings get better and then debt get’s lower. We are also I should note while we are well head of everyone in terms of modernizing our fleet and it will kind of time that we gotten that done and that’s to some future and you won’t see the decade and continued to so debt get’s lower overtime and earnings continued to even to our margins center stay where they are. You will see those numbers get better that’s why we’re comfortable where we are today. And we think we are today we because of the reason I said and we have the right structure in place. We too as a insurance material lot more cash than others but we think that’s a better way to do this for our shareholders and able to pay cash 3%. Dan McKenzie Thanks for the time. Operator Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi Thanks for the time and Doug just two follow up on some of your comments around aircraft age and I know you inherited a significant majority of your order book from your predecessor but if the long term plan to maintain the same relative age advantage over your competitors you have today because I think you doing so would imply much different longer term CapEx profile then allowing if lead edge… Doug Parker Yes, aircraft age is not a metric that we look at to measure versus our competitors I just point out where it is and but we don’t have goal to say we need to be below the other aircraft age but its noteworthy. But I think we will get to conversations about relative debt levels to point out how much stronger asset base is mine and the best way to communicate to point out how much younger our fleet is, it look it is a is absolutely customer advantage when you get one - new airplanes - there is no doubt and that is much better in flight product and you can tell the difference. And so we feel good about that and that you are right, the orders were in place and they’re coming and we’re taking them and but the bigger point that they trying to make here is these are if you look in the very near term, you may say 'Oh my gosh, they have always debt, these are 25 years assets and those airlines have 17 year old airplanes won't be able to have 42 year old airplanes, 25 years from now. So at some point my point is were ahead of them and suggesting they need to go spending almost not a capital very near term and but they’ll need to do something and we won’t have to at the point, the way that's worked. So anyway our goal is to make sure we have the absolute young as its nice when you are in the position but to the extent you want to look at relative debt levels, you need to look at the asset base. Our asset base is just tremendously more. Darryl Genovesi Great, thanks for that. And then I guess if I just ask you on or maybe Robert or whoever wants to comment, can you just give us some sense of how your view on your Phoenix hub is evolving given your recent emphasis on Los Angeles and the existing presence in Dallas? Robert Isom Thanks. Appreciate it. Phoenix hub does well for us. It serves the same purpose that we did it as over - since the start of the merger and it’s a great connecting half, it's got a growing metro area and its serving our network very well. Darryl Genovesi Great, thank you. Doug Parker International gateway that we -- and I’m looking to expand but they’re complimentary not… Operator And our next question comes from Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew Didora Hi, good morning everyone. Just one question for Robert, I guess when I look at your on time performance they really start to lag both your network appear starting about six months ago or so. Is there a reason for this is anything going on with the integration that would have caused and I can imagine that it's all the LA issues that you mentioned in your prepared remarks. And I know you mentioned solid corporate share earlier but have you heard anything from your corporate customers on this performance. Thanks. Robert Isom The answer in terms of corporate customers, the answer is no. We haven’t heard anything we’re performing very well as I said in my remarks with our corporate business. So in terms of the summer and the fall up, that’s really where I look at things and associated with the schedule were I think we just quite frankly we were pretty aggressive in terms of the schedule that we put out this summer, we had issues in Los Angeles, we definitely had I think in order in amount of weather issues associated with the DFW and then Chevrolet in Miami and that was problematic. So it seem like we’re in a recovery phase a lot of during the summer. As I said before we have a lot of integration tools that we didn’t have that we will in the future and that is on building airline back after disruption and making sure our customers and their baggage is taking care of. One of the things you will note though is we continued to be really strong in terms of our departing on time performance these your performance that’s something that we continued to see and I think that will translate into more competitive arrivals within 14 performance and you'll us as well that our completion factor as we move from operating two systems and really three systems in regard to our pilots down to one that we got a chance to much, much better. So I'm optimistic of where we headed and if you take a look at where we at right now schedule reductions associated with the fall season with the changes to our Los Angeles operation. We are operating back at new record levels and that should continue and again as I said before all efforts are focused on making sure that we worked together to put out a schedule in 2017 that we can operate lively and competitively with the best in business. Andrew Didora Great, thank you. Operator And that ends the analyst questions. We will now take the questions from media. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Andrea Ahles Hello good morning. I would like to follow up a little bit on Helane Becker's question regarding the possibility reducing headcount and how that might be done in 2017. Are you looking at actually doing sort of any lay off reduction in force particularly headquarters where you may have overlapping function as you operate, as you go from operating two lines down into one can you give a little more color or detail on that. Doug Parker Sure, absolutely not, but glad you asked. We made it sound that way. We have through pockets of the airline in different groups we will have, we have because we're running two airlines people that are -- where we have more people we elevate other one. But we will manage that over time through attrition. If it makes sense, if it's a labor group or layouts whatever works for our people to make sure we do that. We don't have any intention nor do we care to go through like you described, we'll do this in a way that works for our team. Andrea Ahles All right. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News Mary Schlangenstein Hi. So I want to follow-up on Andrew's question, do you guys have some sense of the number of physicians that you're talking about that you have redundancy across your workforce. Doug Parker Nothing we can talk about yet. Again this is more of a beyond 2017 initiative. We're going to do the work through 2017. We still do have two airlines to our customers we know, but we still have two fleets. So it's not integrated. While we have that going on, we can't do any of this work what we never did in 2017 to figure out where it is and as we know more, we'll let people know. The good news in this is we have regular attrition rights and we have ways to -- we let people look to retire early and we'll work through those things as it becomes an issue. Right now we're just -- the reason we mentioned it is simply because it's important to the analyst community to understand that that will be something that comes beyond 2017. Mary Schlangenstein Right. So you will only consider things like early retirements, buyouts to know involuntary furloughs is what you're saying. Doug Parker Yes. As we sit here today that's what I speak it's correct. Conditions can change and also I want to make this sound like some enormous number of people. So we have pockets of people throughout the organization and as I said and we will work through to make sure this works out for those who are either looking to leave or want to leave on their own as they -- as we have natural attrition with more places. Mary Schlangenstein Yes. Doug Parker So this is nothing about furloughs and layoffs, all about the fact that as you move from two airlines to truly one airline, we will be able to get some cost efficiencies. Mary Schlangenstein Great. Thank you very much. Operator Next we have Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell Hi thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask a bit more about the premium economy roll out on the rest of the wide body fleet. You outlined target of getting it done in 2017. I wanted to with the business class roll out that ended up being delayed. How do you plan to achieve the roll out in 2017? Robert Isom So Edward the premium economy is actually going to go on our A330 200 fleet, the 777-200s, 777-300s and then our 787 fleet, and as we have said 787-9s are starting now and as Don mentioned, we should have for sale in terms of a different class of service next year, but reconfigurations are going to take place over the course of the next really 18 months, 24 months. So we're not going to be ready along all those fleets until June of 2018. Edward Russell Okay. Got it thank you and how many roughly, how many do you forecast the reduction in number of economies seats on these aircrafts as you make the modifications or you assume they're going to be neutral? Robert Isom I think we're talking about a row generally. I think so that will vary on different aircraft types, but that should be about the way it rolls out. Edward Russell About the economy, thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Conor Shine with Dallas Morning News. Doug Parker Hi Conor. Conor Shine Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the improving TRASM trend. What are the kind of the factors that are driving that improvement? Is it just the reduction in capacity growth going forward or are there other elements to that? Doug Parker Don do you want to take? Don Casey Sure, there are two areas that really kind of driving the growth. One is Latin American and Latin American both Brazil where we've seen 25% increase in the revenue year-over-year, Mexico is performing strongly and we got positive revenue growth in Mexico and Venezuela is contributing to overall unit revenue growth as well. Domestic business the trend there really has been positive. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen close in yields strength. We've also seen a stabilized pricing environment that's been pretty tumultuous this year but as of late July I can even doubt that when we look at the domestic business from O&D perspective we're seeing kind of the best and strongest yield performance in connecting in oil markets and domestic business which ties a little bit back my earlier comments on pricing. And also we're seeing the benefits now of the credit card deal that we did in the second quarter as well. Conor Shine Good. Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Ted Reed with The Street. Ted Reed Thank you. I just had a couple questions about Latin America, some just answered, but are these gains in Latin America are they sustainable? How much of an edge did they give you over your competitors with less presence in Latin America and also when are you going to be able to make money in Cuba and will this be a factor in improving PRASM in Latin America or will it be will be less valuable there. Don Casey This is Don again, when we look at the trends in Latin America, we would expect Brazil is a big factor obviously in the overall result and we're expecting our performance in Brazil in the fourth quarter to be better materially better than the performance in the third quarter. So we think our performance in Latin America overall is going to continue to get that. Now for Cuba, I think everything is struggling a little bit in terms of selling in Cuba, there are a lot of restrictions that are still in place that made it difficult to sell. Right now we're seeing greatest strength in terms of forward-booking in the Havana markets where we've had our long presence with our charter operation. But I think Cuba is going to be a bit of a long road I think. Doug Parker We're in for the long haul. It's not something we didn't expect. This is really a new market and so at any rate we're excited to be the largest carrier there. We're committed to Cuba and making it work and we'll work through the startup to get into the point where eventually where we all expect we'll be. Excited about the start of Havana on November 30. Ted Reed All right. Quickly most I assume the vast majority of sales are in the U.S. in Miami. Doug Parker Yes they are. Ted Reed All right. Thank you. Operator And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Dan Cravens for any additional or closing remarks. Doug Parker This is Doug. Thanks everybody. Again look the story to this from my perspective listening to all this is you know is the team when we did this merger less than three years ago the biggest questions we get on this call was concerns about our ability to manage the integration and I couldn’t be more pleased with the work the team has done to get through flawlessly things like PSS and this is now five. So the delays here has helped us has managed us as a full team effort which is why it's so hard. It takes cross functional work when people are trying to actually do their full jobs there. So we're elided that that concern we've been able to take off your list of concerns and that's important but what is more important about is it shows what a great team we have here and the things we can do and now with much of that work behind not all of it but much of it behind us, we are extremely excited about everything that we have going on particularly the investments we are making in our people and our product that will accrue to our customers and the upside that provides us but we're in this for the long-term, we're excited about the long term and we appreciate your support thanks.

Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And now, I would like to turn the conference to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir. Dan Cravens Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to the American Airlines fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings conference call. We’ve got a lot of people in the room today, but on the call we’ve got Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, our President; and Derek Kerr, our Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A sessions we’ve got Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communication; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, our Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; Don Casey, our SVP of Revenue Management; and Andrew Nocella, our SVP of Network Planning. We are going to start the call today with Doug and he will provide an overview of our fourth-quarter and 2016 results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on our ops performance and revenue environment, and then after we hear from those comments we will open the call for analyst Q&A and lastly questions from the media. Before we begin we must state that today’s call does contain forward-looking statements including statements concerning future revenues and cost, forecast of capacity traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning and our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release, and that can be found on our website at AA.com under the More About American Airlines Investor Relations section. A webcast of this call will also be archived on our website. The information that we are giving you on this call is as of today’s date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us this morning. At this point I will turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker. Doug Parker Thank you, Dan. Thank you everyone for being with us. We are happy to report our results. Fourth-quarter pre-tax earnings excluding special charges were $773 million. For the full-year on that same number we produced $5.1 billion of earnings. That’s the second-best year in American Airlines history, second only to 2015. We are particularly pleased with our revenue performance. Our total revenue per ASM was up 1.3% in the fourth-quarter. That is our first year-over-year increase since the fourth-quarter of 2014, and we are the first major airline to be able to report year-over-year improvement. Now our unit cost increased more than we’d like, Derek will talk more about that. That’s certainly more than we’d like to see on a run rate basis. But that is almost entirely due to increases in our employee expenses. And as Derek will describe that growth should taper off as 2017 unfolds. And we expect additional cost savings in 2018 as we complete our integration. But look, our people deserve these compensation increases and more. They are doing an incredible job of taking care of our customers and managing through this integration. Our earnings include a $314 million accrual for profit sharing. This will be the first American Airlines profit-sharing payment since 2000. And that’s due to a program that we at American unilaterally implemented for our team in 2016 and that we are very excited about. The fact is the exceptional performance by our team is being noticed. We are honored to be named Airline of the Year by Air Transport World for 2017. That’s the first time American Airlines has won this award since 1988. We know we have a lot of work to do. Our team is excited about that fact. But we are back in consideration for being amongst the greatest airlines in the world, and that is a validation of all the work our team has done. We expect and intend to remain there. And we do not intend to wait 30 more years to win this award again. So with that said I will turn it over to Derek to give you more details, and then Robert. Derek Kerr Thanks, Doug, and good morning everyone. We did file our earnings release this morning and in that release we announced our fourth-quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $289 million or $0.56 per diluted share. This compares to our fourth-quarter 2015 GAAP net profit of $3.3 billion or $5 per diluted share which included a $3 billion non-cash tax benefit resulting from the reversal of our Company’s valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2015. Excluding special charges we reported a net profit of $475 million in the fourth-quarter of 2016, or $0.92 per diluted share versus our fourth-quarter of 2015 net profit of $1.3 billion or $2 per diluted share. As Doug said, our GAAP fourth-quarter 2016 pre-tax profit was $550 million. And excluding special charges our fourth-quarter pre-tax profit was $773 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 7.9%. For the full-year our GAAP pre-tax income was $4.3 billion and our pre-tax income excluding special items was $5.1 billion. This equates to a 2016 pre-tax margin of 12.6%. As Doug said both the 2016 pre-tax income and margin were the second-best in Company’s history. On a full-year basis excluding special charges and a non-cash tax provision of $1.6 billion our adjusted fully diluted EPS was $9.10, down only $0.02 from 2015 which reflects a 19.1% reduction in our fully diluted average share count during the year. We are pleased to see improved revenue performance in the fourth-quarter of 2016 as total operating revenues were up 1.7% year-over-year to $9.8 billion. Passenger revenues were $8.3 billion, up 0.5% on a yield improvement of 1.8%. This was the first year-over-year increase in PRASM, yield and TRASM since the fourth-quarter of 2014. And Robert will give more detail on this in his remarks. Cargo revenues were up 1.3% to $194 million due primarily to improving yields. Other operating revenues were $1.2 billion, up 10.2% versus the same period last year due primarily to the impact of our new credit card agreements signed with Barclaycard U.S., Citi and MasterCard in July 2016. Total GAAP operating expenses for the fourth-quarter of 2016 were $9 billion, up 5.4% versus the same period last year. Fourth-quarter mainline CASM per ASM was $0.1293, up 5.7% year-over-year. Excluding special charges and fuel our mainline CASM was $0.1017, up 10.3% year-over-year, primarily driven by the salary and benefit increases provided to our team members which was worth 7 points, the introduction of our profit-sharing plan 1 point, aircraft maintenance timing 1 point and increased depreciation and amortization 1 point resulting from new aircraft and increased capital investment. Regional operating cost per ASM in the fourth-quarter was $0.196, down 0.9% from the corresponding quarter in 2015. Excluding special charges and fuel regional CASM was $0.157, a decrease of 2.5% due to the continued shift to more efficient regional jets. Consolidated CASM ex-fuel was up 8.5% for the fourth-quarter. We ended the year with approximately $8.8 billion in total available liquidity comprised of cash and investments of $6.4 billion and $2.4 billion in undrawn revolver capacity. The Company also has $638 million in restricted cash. During the quarter we completed several financing transactions. These include closing the 2016-3 Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates with total proceeds of $814 million. We repriced our $1 billion spare parts term loan and refinanced our 2013 Citi term loan with a new $1.25 billion facility. In the fourth-quarter of 2016 the Company returned $606 million to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments totaling $52 million and the repurchase of $554 million of common stock for 12.2 million shares. The $2 billion share repurchase program authorized in April 2016 is now complete. During 2016 we returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, bringing the total to more than $9.6 billion since our capital return program started in May 2014. That number includes $9 billion to repurchase 228.4 million shares at an average share price of $39.41 and – sorry, $646 million in dividends. Including shares repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee share distributions and equity awards and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt our share count has dropped by almost a third from 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 507.3 million shares at the end of 2016. On January 25 the Company’s Board authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to be completed by the end of 2018, and the Company also declared a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on February 27 to stockholders of record as of February 13. With respect to our pension obligations, the Company is committed to being fully funded under the existing airline relief legislation. In order to be fully funded we will make an approximately $300 million contribution in the second quarter of 2017. Upon expiration of the legislation at the end of 2017 we are expected to make contributions of approximately $1.1 billion in 2018 and $850 million in 2019. Taking these planned pension contributions into consideration, our current debt levels, and to protect against the impact of an adverse economic shock, we have increased our minimum target liquidity balance by $500 million to $7 billion, a significantly stronger liquidity position than our competitors. Turning to 2017, our capacity is planned to be up approximately 1% which is consistent with our prior guidance. Domestic capacity is expected to be flat with 3% fewer departures offsetting a 3% increase in gauge, with international capacity is up 4% primarily due to the completion of the 777-200 retrofit program in the second quarter and a run rate impact of three new Pacific markets that were added in 2016. During the quarter the 1% ASM growth – or by quarter the 1% ASM growth in 2017 is approximately 2% down in the first quarter, up 1% in the second quarter and up 2% in both the third and fourth-quarter. Also consistent with prior guidance we expect year-over-year CASM, consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items, to be up approximately 4%. We are continuing to make significant investments to close the revenue and operational gap with our competitors. These incremental investments are focused on our people, our product and our operation. The increase is made up of 2 points in salaries and benefits, 1 point in maintenance and 1 point in depreciation for our aircraft replacement program and increased non-aircraft investments. Year-over-year unit cost increases are greatest in Q1 as capacity is down by 2% and these salary increases given to our maintenance and fleet service team members are not lapped until the middle of the third quarter. So by quarter consolidated CASM excluding fuel and special items is expected to increase by 8% to 10% in the first quarter, 4% to 6% in the second quarter, 1% to 3% in the third quarter and zero to 2% in the fourth-quarter. As we talked about on the last call we are close to finalizing the majority of the integration work. Therefore, in 2017 we plan to review our cost structure and eliminate redundancies that still exist post-integration. We also expect improved asset utilization and increased productivity as a number of investments in our operations take hold. We will see the effect of these initiatives in 2018 and beyond. We expect higher fuel prices in 2017 to drive an increase in fuel expenses of approximately $1.4 billion over 2016. Based on the fuel curve as of January 24, 2017 our mainline fuel price forecast for the first quarter of 2017 is $1.66 to $1.71 per gallon. We do expect to pay $1.72 to $1.77 for the full year. Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided along with the revenue guidance that Robert will give we expect the first-quarter pre-tax margin excluding special items to be between 3% and 5%. For 2017 capital expenditures we expect to take delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 12 regional aircraft, resulting in total gross aircraft CapEx of approximately $4.1 billion. This is the final year of the big capital expenditures for aircraft and it reduces in 2018 and beyond. In addition, we expect to invest $1.5 billion in non-aircraft CapEx for the full year which includes continued integration work and the investments to improve our product and operations. So in conclusion, we are very pleased with the outstanding results our team produced in 2016 and look forward to another great year in 2017. I’d like to thank our 120,000 team members for all they have done in 2016 to make American the airline of the year. Thanks again for your time this morning. And I will turn it over to Robert. Robert Isom Thanks, Derek. Good morning and thanks for joining us. We took tremendous strides in 2016 integrating our airline. In addition, we enhanced our network, fleet, customer service and operation. Our employees saw changes in the past year as well with the return of profit-sharing, workspace improvement, labor agreements and the rollout of in-depth customer service training programs. Many of these steps weren’t easy and I’d like to thank our more than 100,000 team members for their outstanding work throughout the year. As the integration chapter draws to a close a new chapter of innovation is opening. Following a challenging operating environment in the summer our frontline team rebounded with the fall schedule and quickly brought our operations back to the same trajectory that we saw earlier in the year. In October and November our baggage handling performance reached record levels for the new American. In addition, our November completion factor reached a record high for the Company. While December brought the typical operational challenges that come with winter weather and the increased holiday flying our operational performance still improved year-over-year across the board. As we discussed on our last call on October 1, we moved to a single flight operating system which allowed pilots and aircraft from each legacy carrier to be scheduled interchangeably. This transition has already paid dividends over the last three months as evidenced by the operational results. Moving forward, running a single flight operating system will not only improve operational results, but it will provide the opportunity to fine-tune the network to serve each market with the approximate mix of frequency – with the appropriate mix of frequency and capacity. It will also assist in recovering from irregular ops as the team and the IOC will have access to a full complement of aircraft and pilot resources to help put the operation back on schedule when things go off. We are very pleased with our revenue performance in the fourth-quarter. Our fourth-quarter passenger revenue per ASM was up two-tenth of a percent and our fourth-quarter total revenue per ASM was up 1.3%, marking the first positive result for any U.S. carrier in a year and a half and the first time for a legacy carrier in almost two years. And this is the second quarter, consecutive quarter where our unit revenue performance was materially better than the rest of the industry and our legacy competitors in particular. It’s clear that the investments that we are making in our people and our product are gaining traction in the marketplace, and based on published guidance we expect our out-performance to continue in the first quarter, as well. In spite of unfavorable holiday shifts our domestic consolidated PRASM was up three-tenth of a percent. We saw improvement broadly across all hubs with DFW and Los Angeles leading the way. The domestic business benefited from a stable pricing environment and we saw our strongest yield improvements come from flow market. Our corporate share was positive for the fourth consecutive quarter and we did see a bump in volume and yield post-election. In particular, we saw strength in banking, financials, industrials and in entertainment. Our Latin performance overall was very strong as well with PRASM up 10.2%. Although Brazil led the way, Mexico, Central America and Venezuela were all positive for the quarter. On a year-over-year basis our Brazil PRASM was up 53%. However, it still remains negative on a year over two-year basis. Our Caribbean performance continues to remain under pressure from low-cost carrier capacity additions throughout 2016 which has resulted in a weak pricing environment. The Atlantic was our worst performing international entity with PRASM down 7.7%. The main drivers of this performance are continued capacity increases specifically from low-cost carriers and negative foreign-exchange impact resulting from the strengthening U.S. dollar. American is highly exposed to the pound with half of our transatlantic capacity in the UK. The weakened pound negatively impacted UK PRASM by about 5 points. Across the Pacific PRASM was down 4.9% on capacity increases of 39% as we grow into the new services from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, Canada, Sydney and Auckland. Looking forward we continue to see positive trends overall in the forward revenue environment and expect positive year-over-year TRASM in each quarter of 2017. Regionally our domestic first-quarter PRASM is expected to continue to improve versus the fourth-quarter as the pricing environment has stabilized and competitive capacity growth has moderated. In Latin America we expect another quarter of strong year-over-year improvement while the Pacific entity is expected to decline at a similar level to the fourth-quarter. Lastly, the Atlantic region is showing modest signs of improvement due to easing comps from past terror event as well as our capacity reduction. However, it remains challenged as low-priced carriers continue to grow and the British pound remains weak. With that, we expect fourth-quarter total revenue per ASM, not passenger, but total RASM to be up 2.5% to 4.5% year-over-year. As we look beyond the first quarter we are excited about the commercial initiatives that our team has worked so hard on. We recently announced our new Basic Economy product which will begin selling in February. Basic Economy will not only allow us to offer a tailored product to all of our customers, but will help us compete more effectively with the growing number of ultra-low-cost carriers. In addition, we have begun to roll out our Premium Economy product on our widebody fleet. And when fully implemented we believe that Basic and Premium Economy combined are worth more than $1 billion in incremental revenue. In conclusion, we took great strides in 2016 to position American as the next industry leader. Our res systems and loyalty programs have been combined, our workgroups have come together and our systems have been merged to create a strong and capable airline that is now delivering positive unit revenue growth. While we have a lot of work to do we look forward to reporting on future successes. And with that I’d like to turn the call back over to the operator to start our Q&A session. Doug Parker Excellent. Thank you, Derek, thank you Robert. Yes, operator, we are ready for questions, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. Doug Parker Hey, Rajeev. Rajeev Lalwani Just first question for you, can you just walk through the approach that you are taking with Basic Economy. Just color on how you’re thinking about domestic versus international, the market, the rollout timeline and so on. And then just specific benefits you are looking for in 2017 on Basic Economy? Robert Isom Well, Don Casey can help me out, but the idea behind Basic Economy and Premium Economy is segmentation and getting a product and a price to customers at every stage of the demand curve. And so the game plan right now is that we are going to be really smart in terms of how we roll out Basic Economy. We are going to start with 10 different markets and that will start here in the next couple of months. And from there we plan to roll it out and to make sure that we can do it effectively at the airports and to really understand how our customers react, as well. Our hope is to have it fully rolled out over the course of 2017 and early 2018 throughout our domestic network. Right now that’s where we stand. From a Premium Economy perspective, of course that’s starting with our international fleet and with the 787-900s, and then from there we will be reconfiguring our fleet, our widebody fleet to allow that to be sold throughout the international network. So we do continue to see the demand for the product. And we think that it’s going to really help us with competition from low-cost carriers and defending our hub. Don? Don Casey Yes, clearly the product features that we have are not changeable, not upgradable, reduced elite qualifying miles as well as no seat selection in our effective barriers for business customers. This is really all about tapping into the willingness to pay for existing product that’s difficult to get at given the current distribution model which just shows the lowest fare. So those product attributes we think business customers are going to be interested in paying a bit more for our product that we offer today. And as we’ve talked to our appropriate customers since we’ve made the announcement they don’t want us to distribute the basic product to them because they don’t see it as attractive. But there’s also an opportunity, we believe, to capture an increased willingness to pay for leisure customers, as well, that are buying further out. And for that we think the carry-on bag restriction or the checked bag-only policy related to the product is actually quite critical to tapping into the willingness to pay for leisure customers. Rajeev Lalwani And in terms of that $1 billion of benefit that you talked about for Basic and Premium, how much is for Basic? Doug Parker This is Doug. I don’t know that we have broken it out. But anyway, know that we believe the value is there, and as Robert just described given the size of the value we want to get there as quickly as we can. We also need to make sure we manage it properly. So as anxious as we are to get it in throughout the system we are not going to go in a way that we can’t manage well and our people can’t manage well. So I think as you go to model this side I would, again, if it were me I wouldn’t build a whole lot into 2017 because we are going to ramp it up, but and then hopefully we will surprise you on the upside, but know that it’s going to be there in 2018. Rajeev Lalwani Okay. And then Doug, a question for you. In terms of domestic capacity you are keeping it flat this year obviously. When does that start to reverse itself and what are the metrics you are looking at to figure out whether or not to start pushing it up? It seems like the RASM trends are clearly in your favor, so just how you are thinking about it. Andrew Nocella Yes, this is Andrew. It’s flat this year. As we look at the balance of international versus domestic it wouldn’t shock me if we slightly toned down international and add a little bit to domestic this year, but that’s not the current plan. We will just watch the trend. And if those trends continue I tend think you’ll see a little bit more next year given that’s where the RASM growth seems to be given the international environment capacity and demand environment right now. Rajeev Lalwani Thank you, gentlemen. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Doug Parker Hey, Duane. Duane Pfennigwerth Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on January, I know you don’t disclose monthly but can you give any sense for trends that you are seeing in South Florida and perhaps the Northeast so far in the month of January? Doug Parker Is there something specific you think we should be seeing that you are asking? Duane Pfennigwerth Just if there is anything off-trend specifically in South Florida as you rolled up, as you started January relative to the rest of the network. Andrew Nocella This is Andrew. I think capacity in South Florida and the Caribbean is really elevated. So it is putting pressure on our Miami hub and I think all South Florida operations. That looks like it’s going to continue for the next few months or quarters at this rate. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. And then on regional capacity I just had a minor detail question. It looks like you are modestly down year-over-year as we roll through the year and you are taking some deliveries. So just wondering is that optimal or was this a function of pilot availability constraints? Can you just talk through the mix shift there? Andrew Nocella I’m not sure I’d say it was optimal. We are working through our regional jet requirements and making an assessment of where we want to be for 2018. We did as you see from the stats reduced departures and grow ASMs, and we’d like that trend and we did, in fact, plan for that. As we look forward for next year I do think we will stop shrinking the regional capacity at this rate because we don’t want to cut our scheduled depth far more than we already have. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay, that’s great. Thanks for taking the questions. Out of respect for the other people on the phone I will keep it there. Thank you. Doug Parker Awesome, thanks, Duane. Operator Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi Hi guys. Thanks for the time. I guess, Derek, I think you said you had some cost reduction initiatives that would help your numbers in 2018 and 2019. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of these things might be? Derek Kerr We really haven’t gone through that process yet, so as we talked about on the last call there’s opportunities. We just haven’t been through it. When we get through all of the work we are going to do on it in 2017 we will give you some guidance going into 2018. We have given you where we think 2017 is going to be and it comes down throughout the year. But as we’ve talked about on last calls I believe the next two years can be, obviously, no more than 2% and should be we can get it below that. So we haven’t really gone through it. We are not going to peg a number at this point in time. But we will give you more as the year goes on probably at the end of the year as we go into 2018. Darryl Genovesi Okay. Doug Parker We understand your desire to know more. We just don’t have much to tell you at this point because we need to go do the work. We, frankly, haven’t spent a lot of time doing that just yet because it’s a ways off because we are still working through the integration. But we wouldn’t mention it if we didn’t think it was a material number, but we don’t have any idea what it is yet. And we wouldn’t want to give you a number and not have it be something we’ve given more thought to it. Darryl Genovesi Okay. And then I guess if I can just ask you a little bit more about 2017 and specifically on free cash flow, Derek, you just took everything you knew today with your pension contributions that you laid out and then whatever you think is an appropriate revenue assumption for the year, would you expect to generate free cash flow this year? Derek Kerr Well, we haven’t given you the full year on RASM. So I think that would give you an answer of what we think our RASM is going to be for the year. I mean – no, no. What I was going to say is we have the aircraft CapEx at $4 billion. We’ve talked about continuing to finance aircraft. We believe we will finance somewhere in the 70%, 75% of that range, so if you take that with the debt payments at $2.1 billion and the pension payment at $300 million, you can use that information to get where you are with whatever your RASM number is for the full year. Darryl Genovesi And then if I could just squeak one in for Robert or Don, I think you’ve said that your Basic Economy product is going to allow you to compete more effectively with ultra low-cost carriers. But I guess I was wondering once you think Basic Economy is fully ramped up, would you expect to be putting more inventory or less inventory towards matching Spirit and Frontier and those kind of competitors down the road than you do today? Don Casey From an inventory perspective, I mean both the main cabin product and the Basic product they share the same inventory. So we are always going to have both products available for our customers. But we will continue to match the ultra low-cost carrier pricing with our Basic product and the Basic product is going to exist on all of the flights that we operate in each market. Darryl Genovesi Okay, thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Doug Parker Hi. Hunter Keay Good morning. So thanks for the – I’m going to come at one of Darryl’s questions a little bit of a different way. In terms of the cost savings opportunities, can you maybe give us some context in terms of the overall opportunity as it relates to the outlook for the next couple of years? Which do you think is a greater opportunity for you to close the margin gap or to get your margins where you want them to be, is maybe a better way of putting it, revenues or costs? Which is the greater degree of opportunity? Doug Parker It’s not even close. It’s cost – it’s revenue. So you can do the analysis here, Hunter. If you look at our gap in margin versus Delta it’s more than 100% revenue, so that’s where it is. That’s the good news, by the way, because that is, one, you are starting to see it close now and we have a number of initiatives that we have to put in place that they to their credit already have in place like Basic Economy. And a number of other things that Don and Robert can talk about, but that’s where the upside is without a doubt. The leverage in this company is in revenue performance to closing the revenue gap, that’s why we are investing so much in the product and that’s why we are investing in the team because we know that’s where the leverage is. It is to close that revenue gap and that is the entirety of the margin gap, indeed it’s more than 100% of it. Hunter Keay Okay. So is that regaining lost share or is that growing the wallet share from your existing customers? Doug Parker Well, again, I will turn it over to the experts first who can give you more details. But know this. Some of it is just where we fly. If you have a large operation in Latin America right now, while that’s a source of the improvement year-over-year it’s also the lowest margin client in the world right now. So some of it, and you will see this from time to time in each of our airlines as we move forward, there will be certain pockets that we fly to that are producing lower margin and others just because the world economies vary. But that’s not the entirety of it by any means. I just want to point that one out. So you see some of that. But look American Airlines are not too long ago didn’t have a RASM gap to Delta Airlines. We’ve gone through a lot. And they’ve been well ahead of us in terms of getting a merger done and being ahead. So that’s where the upside is, and, again, I will let Robert and Don give you more details. Derek Kerr Hunter, I think it’s a combination of both. It’s making sure we get our fair share and growing the pie too. So look, the categories that we’ve got ahead of us and now that so many of the merger constraints and integration are behind us, really exciting to go out and pursue it. As Doug said, many of these things are really things that other carriers have, frankly, had the chance to go pursue. So we are working on schedule and simplifying our design and our rollout for that and potential disruption as we move from schedule to schedule. We think that there is a lot of advantage to that. You know about Basic Economy, you know about Premium Economy. We think that there are things that can be done even further where we are with those categories in terms of rolling out quicker and potentially expanding into other regions. Long-haul interior improvements, you know we are in the final stages of the conversion of our 777-200 and having lie flat seats for all of our international widebody service. And that’s very exciting and showing a lot of results. There was density that came with that, as well. We think that there is actually additional opportunities in terms of density specifically in our narrowbody fleet that we’d like to consider that, again, would get us back to where others in the industry are. There’s work that we are doing in our sales organization, as well. I will let Andrew talk a little bit about this, and I want Don to speak to some of the revenue management issues. But, quite frankly, we have not invested in our salesforce really as we’d like and should have, and that’s had an impact over the last few years. And we are going to turn that around. So with that, Don, why don’t you talk a little bit about your arm stuff and Andrew maybe a little bit more on sales, too? Don Casey Yes, just to touch, basically go back quickly to the segmentation. All the segmentation we are doing, as I mentioned earlier, is it’s just capturing willingness to pay that we are unable to capture without the discounted segmentation model. And that’s really growing the pie. We don’t have to take traffic from anyone else to be able to increase revenues. Just on the revenue management side of things we’ve been on a journey here for the last few years for reinventing how we do yield management and revenue management here at American Airlines. We already started in the summer of 2015 when we launched – got a new forecaster, but the new forecaster isn’t really just a black box that suddenly now gives a different number. We completely redid the entire workflow and process within our yield management function. And that was a very, very big change of management process. So we changed the role of the analyst, what they do, how they do it and what they focus on. It did take a while for us to bed that down and get our feet underneath us. Certainly some of the benefit that we’ve seen over the last six months is just better execution on the YM side of the business as we get better and better at the execution in our new field management process. And we’re really not done with that either. That’s really just the first step down this path. We have implemented an entirely new inventory system in October that gives us a lot more capabilities based on the new inventory system and the structure we’ve created in our forecasting model. We’ve implemented a new optimizer which, again, optimizes revenue across the network. That was done in November. And at the same time we’ve reorganized the way we use our inventories which gave us more inventories. We are selling the premium cabin in our domestic business. And we have seen quite material benefits of that, as well. But the optimizer, the new inventory system, more inventories for selling premium product, those are benefits that are going to materialize as we look forward. Hunter Keay All right, thanks. Andrew Nocella On the sales front, Hunter, I think as we look back over the last 12 to 18 months we undersized the salesforce, we have not enough boots on the ground to deal with the potential of corporate contracted revenue that’s out there. That’s, obviously, some of the best revenue in the pool to grab, so we are taking a close look at that. We are going to expand the salesforce. We have worked a lot of process out so we can empower the salesforce to be much more competitive out there. And we do think as we look at the number of contracts we have relative to our primary competitors we have fewer. We are going to close that gap over the next 12 months. We just brought in a new global senior salesperson, Alison Taylor, who is leading that effort. And it’s going to have a really, I think meaningful impact, over the next 12 to 18 months. Doug Parker Look, Hunter, so of all that you just heard I mean everything, most everything Don talked about is not share shift but actually just doing a better job with the existing revenue base. And then what Andrew talked about, obviously, is just getting back to our natural share. It’s not trying to go steal share. We’ve gotten to a point where we have less of that traffic that Andrew talked about that we believe in airline of our size and quality should. So we are going to given all the investment we’ve made we believe it’s natural we should get that share back. Look without, anyway, I will give you my best guess. It’s 80% of the gap closure is going to be doing a better job of just managing our revenues better and 20% of it is getting back some of our natural share. Hunter Keay Yes, that’s great. Begs a lot a follow-up questions, but I will leave it there. Thank you so much. Doug Parker Thanks, Hunter. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker Hey. Good morning, Doug. I will let somebody else ask you about relative margins for a change. My question has to do with costs. I know that you attribute the bulk of 2017 CASM to labor. I get that. But what am trying to understand is whether all the investments in the business, investments that hopefully allow you to run as efficient an airline as Delta, are these investments currently being made or is that more of a 2018 issue? The reason I ask is that I don’t want to be too optimistic in believing that you could have the best year-on-year cost performance of any airline next year as we anniversary labor. I guess another way of asking is whether you believe you will be running the airline you want to be running by the end of this year or is there still a lot of cost wood to chop in 2018? Let me put it that way. Doug Parker Can you say it again? I just want to make sure I got you right. Jamie Baker All right. What’s your 2018 ex-fuel CASM forecast? Simple enough, but if you want to confuse that with revenue you can tell me that number. Doug Parker Look, I think we’ve tried to answer that. Here is what we believe. And once we get through what we’ve built into our 2018 plan for expenses, we believe, I’m sorry, 2017, thanks Derek, we believe in 2017 what we have built into our 2017 expenses and therefore what you see in what Derek gave you for guidance, we believe we have everything we need to go compete. Jamie Baker Okay. Doug Parker So and, again, that’s the belief. Other airlines go and make other changes. We may need to adjust accordingly, of course, so caveat as we should. But this isn’t, we feel really good about once we get through 2017 we’ve got the investment in the airline we need to go run it. Look, I’ve got to tell you there’s one other thing going on, though, as you should know which is the reason we have a cost advantage that I talked about is because we still have some of our employees making less than are being paid at other airlines. That’s something that, again, we have contracts in place and things like that that you need to be thinking of that as you go forward. You should not expect that we are going to try and run our airline as we sign new contracts with a cost advantage versus those airlines because we don’t intend to. Our people are the best there are. So know that. That cost advantage no one should expect to be long-term sustainable. Jamie Baker Okay, understood. I appreciate that. And the second question for Bev. Could you just outline with a little bit more granularity, and feel free to geek out if you want to, what are the relevant integration exercises that are yet to take place and what’s the approximate timing and approximate risk of each one, or associated with each one? Bev Goulet Well, Jamie, you know me well enough to know that I like to geek out. But I will try to… Jamie Baker We’ve known each other a while. Bev Goulet Really three major projects left to get done. First of all is getting our flight attendants into a common system. Hard at work on that right now. It’s a complicated matter. We are essentially taking an LUS contract and modifying the LAA system to accommodate it. But a lot of really good work going on right now. You know, we don’t have a firm plan yet, but we are optimistic within the next 12-plus months we ought to see something there. Also putting in a state-of-the-art HR and payroll system, again a lot of work there when you consider that it covers 650,000 people or so. And then finally we don’t have our tech ops organization integrated yet. And that is a long-term process, best case probably another three to four years. Jamie Baker Okay, very good. Thanks to both of you. I appreciate it. Good luck. Doug Parker Thanks, Jamie. Jamie Baker Thanks, Doug. Operator We will go next to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth Hey. Good morning. So I just wanted to ask on the cash returned to shareholder standpoint, I’m guessing we are going to get a slowdown from the last couple of years. But just wanted to maybe understand a little bit better how you think about that regarding share buyback and also dividends. I know from a dividend yield standpoint you are kind of behind some of your competitors. How do you think about those items? Doug Parker Okay, we’ve got to be a little careful about what we talk about, obviously, in the future and how we plan to return – how we plan to redistribute to shareholders, but I will say this. We are happy with the dividend that we are providing shareholders at this point. As we talk to our shareholders, at least those shareholders of American Airlines today they seem more excited about share repurchase activity, the dividend activity. That, of course, could change and we will keep talking to them. So as it relates to the share repurchase, I will let Derek talk about where we are on that activity. Derek Kerr I think the third and fourth quarter slowed down versus the first and second quarter as we, the two things that we did is we looked at our minimum cash levels and we’ve raised that from 6.5 to 7. So we have probably less excess cash than we have had since the beginning of the merger. So I would expect it to slow down a little bit, but that all depends on timing and where we go with things and what the forecast looks like. So I would hate to project what we are going to do during the year. We just announced the new $2 billion program, so I won’t project how quick we are going to do that. It all depends on what the outlook looks like moving forward and where we are going to end the year and we adjust it quarterly depending on how everything looks. Doug Parker I will just add this. We remain bullish, that’s for sure. Derek Kerr Yes. Doug Parker We talked at length about the upside we think we have on the revenue side. And we continue to believe the industry in total is being undervalued just because of shareholders who are concerned that this really, the issue really hasn’t changed the way we believe it has. So we are really quite bullish. We think there’s now some – we think the industry multiples are lower than they should be and within the industry we think American has more upside than anyone else. So long as we continue to produce earnings that we expect, so long as having used those to continue to invest in the business at the level we think makes sense, which by the way we are investing more capital in this airline than has ever been invested in an airline in the history of commercial aviation and we are proud of that. We are going to be putting out a product that’s so much different than what the customers of American have seen in the past as we move forward. And we are excited about the that. But, anyway, as we continue to be able to do that to the level we need to and we still continue to have excess cash which we expect we will be returning that to our shareholders as we should, particularly at peak moments. Savi Syth That’s helpful. Thanks, Doug. And if I may follow up with you are coming, gone through most of the integration process here. I think there was talk about maybe having an Analyst Day this year. Just thoughts on that, and then maybe what we should expect from it. Derek Kerr Yes, I think we are still working through that. It most likely we will have it later in the back half of the year, probably in the third of fourth quarter. No expectations yet. I mean we have – we’ll go through where we are at that point in time. But our plan is to have one later in the year and have a Media and Analyst Day at the same time. Savi Syth Great, thank you. Operator We will next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Doug Parker Hey, Dan. Dan McKenzie Good morning, thanks guys. Well, leave it to me to kick a dead horse here because you guys gave a really good answer on the margin parity question. I just wonder if I can put a little finer point on it. At least as I look at it there’s about $3 billion in revenue that needs to be made up. And Doug, I appreciate your commentary. You’ve got some geographic exposure which I put at a $2 billion revenue hit. So at least as we think about today, should we think about this as a three-year catch up, a five-year plan, a four-year plan? And I guess as we look at these categories that you laid out for us this morning, do they really capture that $3 billion deficit, or are there other initiatives that need to yet be rolled out at some point? Doug Parker Okay, Dan. Really hard to say how many, particularly when you are talking about the piece that is related to global economies, when they return and where those go. So as I know you appreciate hard for us to – and by the way, we are not endorsing your split between how much of that is the relative economies versus things we can do. But you can do that work and come up with whatever number you’d like. But there are certainly some related to that. Of the things that we can control, all the initiatives we’ve talked about, I think, again, you will see a lot of it start to come in 2017 but not be full run rate 2017. Certainly things like Basic Economy. By 2018 you see I don’t know, Don, I don’t want to hang you out there too far. What would you say 2017 versus 2018 – or the 2018 kind of the run rate on these type of revenue initially? Don Casey Well, I mean it – it really varies by very dramatically by initiative, initiative by initiative. The big ones we have talked about, so Premium Economy or Basic Economy, reality is they’re probably going to be 20% this year and 80% next year just based on the where we are in terms of the rollout plan. Some of the things we are doing in the sales side of the business and we are doing on the revenue management side of the business we are going to get to probably I’d say about 60% to 70% of that probably in 2017, the rest of it coming in 2017. Doug Parker So anyway, the short answer is yes, we believe we can close all of it. Clearly the economies may vary and we will see. And we think we can do the majority of that through 2018. Dan McKenzie I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. I guess… Doug Parker And, again, I probably should be clear, completing it in 2018 then really closing in more 2019. Dan McKenzie Understood. Robert, I appreciate the commentary on improved ops. But what are the specific goals as you look ahead, what have been the biggest challenges? And I’m guessing that those might have been tied to the MD-80s and the 767s, and I guess just as you think about the ops, how much of an earnings tailwind do you think a better operation is going to be in 2017 versus what you experienced in 2016? Robert Isom Well, if you take a look at the last few years I think we’ve had our hands full with integrating the airline. In many respects we’ve run two if not three separate systems when you think about pilots, flight attendants and the aircraft. The great news is we got our pilots and our aircraft altogether. That allows us to start making sure that we have our hubs set up and resourced appropriately. It takes a lot of complexity out of the system. Big upside for us I think is completion factor. Big upside I think is production of mis-connected customers. And then when you take a look at the rework that defaults with the off-schedule operation, I can probably talk more about this, we have a lot of investments we’ve been making in the last three years on top of integrating that are going to come to fruition in the next couple of years. So, for instance, in terms of bag mishandling I think there’s a step function improvement that we’re headed towards, not the least of which is just due to general improved operations but also technology that will help us reunite customers with mishandled bags in a much more expedited and hopefully cost-effective fashion. And so that’s going to be a benefit. I think in irregular operation, which has been really the biggest source of issue and concern with customers, it’s tough to put together two systems as opposed to one when things go off schedule. And the good news on that front is we have tools, technology both to get our aircraft and our crews and, importantly, our customers to give them choice to get back on schedule without having to wait in a line or go straight to reservations. That technology I think is all keyed up to come out this year and in 2018, and it’s going to be, again, a big step function improvement for us and something that other competitors have already done. Dan McKenzie Thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it. Robert Isom Thank you. Operator We will go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi Hey. Thank you very much. So Derek, when you guys announced your credit card agreement over the summer, you indicated that the incremental revenue from that was 100% margin. Essentially that the pre-tax income matched the revenue, in other words. So it’s clear that there is no recurring cost allocated against that revenue. If that’s the case, why shouldn’t we think of the $1.5 billion in marketing revenue you guys disclosed in the 2015 10-K as similarly a very, very high-margin revenue, say over 90%? Doug Parker Okay. Hey, Joe, it’s Doug. I’m sorry, what’s… Derek Kerr I think, Joe, what we had said at that point in time, you are right, because all that changed in that transaction was a higher dollar amount for each mile paid. So, in other words, the program was in place, we were getting X for what we were for those miles and that number went up and changed. So that increase was, but the base program is not all incremental and not all single margin, but that increase at that point in time was just a higher paid fee to us per mile. Doug Parker [Indiscernible] $1.5 billion number he’s talking about? Derek Kerr Well, we announced that it was going to be $200 million in the first year, $250 million in the first year, $500 million in the second year and $800 million in the third year. So that was the three-year combination to get to the $1.5 billion of the increase for the next year. Joseph DeNardi Derek, just do so I’m clear, the $1.5 billion you guys in your 2015 10-K disclosed that marketing revenue from the credit card was $1.5 billion. That’s separate from what you announced over the summer. I guess what I’m asking is… Doug Parker Thanks. That’s what I was trying to get at. Okay. So you gave a number for the 2015 K, we’re $1.5 billion. We’ve disclosed that we have indeed signed a new contract and we’ve talked you about the incremental increase. But I think you should add those two numbers and come to a total number, butit’sup to you to decide how to estimate where we are now. So anyway look, as Derek was saying the increase is entirely due to just getting a higher rate per mile for the credit card. So, of course, that will fall almost entirely to the bottom line. Now the initial $1.5 billion you’re talking about, that number is the number that we were collecting at that point in time and, of course, we have to redeem those miles. So there is some cost to that, costs we don’t disclose. But you can rightfully assume that it’s a nicely profitable business or we wouldn’t do it. So we were happy with what we were collecting before the new agreement and now we have a new agreement where we are collecting more. So those I think are facts as we can disclose them. But look, on a bigger point I just want to point out, Joe, you know we’ve noticed what you’ve written on this and look, we agree with you. This is the amount of revenues that the airlines, and particularly American, collect on our – on these marketing agreements, these credit card agreements are different kinds of cash flows than airline cash flows. They are tied to purchases on credit cards not due to airline economy. So I think you are right to suggest that investors should look, should do their best to look through and understand the level of those cash flows and the certainty of them. To which point you are going to say, well, then why don’t you give us more information? And which we will tell you we are tied to confidentiality. But let us go work on it. Let us figure out what we can do to give you more information. I think it is important to our shareholders. I think it is an area where shareholders have understood more how much of our profits and how much of our revenues are tied to things that aren’t really related to the ups and downs of the airline environment, that they would have even a better appreciation for why we are so bullish on this airline. And as we do that what you would learn, of course, is that there is none better than the American Airlines AAdvantage program and our relationship with two providers Citi and Barclays. So we agree with you. Just let us do what we can. We have to live within agreements and we can’t violate those, of course. And we won’t, but we also want to do our best to let our shareholders understand the certainty of the cash flows. Joseph DeNardi Okay, I will leave it there. Thank you. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator We will go next to Helane Baker with Cowen and Company. Doug Parker Did you say… Helane Becker Thanks. Hi guys, it’s Helane Becker. I just have, okay, so first I just have one housekeeping question. I just want to understand RASM improvement, is it sequential, you are talking about the improvement for – you are talking about positive for the year, but are you also talking about sequential improvement from one quarter, two quarter and so on? Doug Parker All the numbers we give are year-over-year numbers. Derek Kerr Yes. Helane Becker Okay, then fine. Thank you. My other question, Doug, when you think about the Atlantic and the numbers that you provided and you see the capacity growth that’s coming from especially the low-cost carriers, if you don’t grow, or if you shrink too much you cede market share and that puts you, I would think, longer term in a tougher position because your goal is, obviously, to be the best. Not necessarily the largest, but certainly the best and to want business travelers to choose American first. And I’m just trying to make sure I understand that the changes that you are talking about making aren’t going to put you in a position where yields just keep declining in that market as these new low-cost competitors come in. Andrew Nocella Well, Helane, this is Andrew. I think American’s position across the Atlantic combined with our joint venture partners, particularly British Airways, is really strong. What we did in the first quarter was cull some flying that was incredibly unprofitable, so you see our ASM shrinking just a bit. But that capacity has moved to the third quarter which is a lot more lucrative for us and, obviously, the industry. So we’ve moved capacity where we think it needs to be. We don’t intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody. And we are working with our JV partners to make sure we have an effective plan going forward to compete. And that is continued segmentation of the product as we talked about for the future. So we feel bullish about that. It’s definitely going to be a really tough competitive environment, particularly I think over the next year, year and a half as we see these capacity inflows. But our position is it’s good, London Heathrow is the best hub in Europe and we feel good about it. Helane Becker Okay, great. Thank you. Those were two of my questions. And I will turn the mic over. Thank you. Andrew Nocella Thanks, Helane. Operator We will go next to David Vernon with Bernstein. Doug Parker Hi, David. David Vernon Hey guys, thanks for making the time. Just a question for you on the cadence of changes in the ASM forecast. Obviously, you are starting off with very good guidance on the TRASM number. If market conditions stay where they are, should we expect a pickup in the rate of ASM growth to be a little bit of a headwind on that number? Or is that not going to be as sensitive as the unit cost number? Derek Kerr You mean the pickup on ASMs versus… David Vernon Yes, it seems like the ASMs dip and then they accelerate to about 2.4% by the end of the year. I’m just wondering if the unit revenue growth that we should be expecting would be impacted by that changing mix at all? Obviously, I would think it’s impacting the unit cost growth a little bit. As you get more volume you are seeing a lower rate of unit increase. Doug Parker We are not giving forward RASM growth. But absolutely, if you see higher growth in ASMs, all else equal you would expect to see the RASM growth decline and the CASM growth decline. That’s correct. So, again, make your own revenue forecast, but certainly capacity growth matters. David Vernon Yes, I was just looking to make sure that there wasn’t something I was missing in that if there was anything specific… Doug Parker No, you’re not. Okay David Vernon And then as you think about the guidance on interest expense, the step-up of $90 million or so, is that anticipating additional leverage or is that just associated with some of the variable-rate debt? Derek Kerr There is a little bit of increase in debt just due to the aircraft coming on. So it’s really driven by the year-over-year increase in debt is that because we took some on last year. Project debt to be up somewhere, net debt to be up or total debt to be up somewhere in the $800 million range, so just slightly up in 2017. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Doug Parker Hi Andrew. Andrew Didora Hi, good morning everyone. Just one question, one for Robert as a follow-up on Basic Economy. It’s clearly an offering that you and your competitors think will be a nice positive. Whenever I hear that I tend to question it a little bit what everybody thinks is going to be good. But I guess what do you see as the biggest risk in the product and maybe Robert what are the key metrics that you will be watching just to judge whether this product is a success or not? Robert Isom The risk that I see out there is really execution. So making sure that we have our customers educated on the product and our airports and employees all set to deliver I think is the big risk. But in terms of performance we are going to be watching it on all fronts, certainly from an operations perspective. But revenue performance is what this is designed to address. And so on all levels we will be keeping an eye. Don? Don Casey Obviously, the key thing is trying to figure out what the price premium can be for the main cabin product compared to Basic. And that is going to be a function of the competitive environment. And we are just going to have to figure that out as we go. Obviously, where we compete with Southwest but that does not have a bag fee we are going to have to, again, test to see what kind of premium we can get for our main cabin product versus the Basic product. Andrew Didora Can you give us a sense for just in terms of that premium what the way you see demand shaping up for the Basic Economy product what you think is a reasonable revenue premium? Don Casey Our pricing for the product is going to be in the marketplace in the middle of February. And so until we get the pricing in the market I don’t think we really can talk about what kind of premium we are going to see. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg Hey, good morning everybody. Just two quick ones here for Derek. Derek, when we think about CapEx and debt I guess this is the year of the peak, 2017? Derek Kerr Right. Michael Linenberg Is that? Okay. Then just with respect to the pension, it looks like that you are either pulling some of the contributions forward? Or was there an accounting change there that’s driving you to the higher numbers? Derek Kerr No, we just pulled it forward into 2017 just to make sure that we are fully funded from an airline relief act. That’s the only thing that we did. We used to have $1.4 billion in 2017, we just pulled $300 million of it forward in 2017 and left the $1.1 billion in 2018. So that’s the only change to the pension payment. Michael Linenberg Okay. And then just on the pension, what was the liability at year-end and then those numbers that you threw out there for 2017 and 2018, presumably that’s still using a lower discount rate, right? Derek Kerr 2017 is. 2018 is not, because that’s when the relief act goes away. The liability, our total liability was $17 billion and our assets are about $10 billion. Michael Linenberg Okay, so let’s call it… Derek Kerr At the end of the year. Michael Linenberg Okay, very good. Derek Kerr That’s from a GAAP perspective. Michael Linenberg Absolutely. Okay, great. Thank you. Derek Kerr Thanks. Operator We would like to now take our questions from media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Doug Parker Hi, Mary. Mary Schlangenstein Hi, that was close. I had two quick questions, please. The first is when Beth was talking about the FOS for flight attendants and she mentioned a 12-month time frame. Is that 12 months to have everything in place and done, or is that 12 months to get your plan and then have to put it in place? Bev Goulet Yes, Mary, I think I said 12-months plus. We are still working out the details of the plan and, obviously, the most important thing is to get it right. It’s complex, there’s a lot of change. We want to make sure we have our employees fully trained and ready to go. So we will be back to you a little bit later in terms of a firm plan. Mary Schlangenstein Okay. Are there any numbers or figures on how much you are not getting, how much of a benefit you are not getting by continuing to run two systems or I guess how much an extra cost that is? Robert Isom It’s hard to quantify it. But I will tell you what, the vast majority of the integration benefit is really with the aircraft being able to be moved around. So there is inefficiency in the system. But it’s something that really at the end of the day is more an issue that we want to get, we want to take care of for our employees, that they are able to be based where they want to in an unrestricted fashion so they have the benefit of moving around, as well. So we are trying to get it as quickly as possible but I can tell you the biggest benefit I think will be for our employees. Maya you want to… Mary Schlangenstein Okay. Maya Leibman Just to add to what Bev said, to your question, Mary, we will have a plan with a firm date no later than the end of this quarter. Doug Parker That was Maya Leibman. Mary Schlangenstein Right, right. Okay, great. So you would hope to have FOS in place or have the two flight attendants all integrated by the end of 12 months after that or the end of this year? Doug Parker It’s the best – we don’t – at the end of this quarter we will have a better idea of exactly. Mary Schlangenstein Media Of plan. Okay. Then quickly my second question was you’ve talked a couple of times about redundancies. And I know you staffed up to take part, to take care of some parts of the integration, especially the IT issues to make sure everything went well. When you are looking at redundancies is there a possibility of us seeing some job cuts at American? Doug Parker Right Robert Isom Look, when we talk about redundancies we’ve hired a lot of folks here over the last few years. I think some order of magnitude almost 20,000 employees when you take into account attrition that has happened, as well. My view is that as we take a look going forward we are going to continue to have attrition within the Company. And the real benefit comes in not having to hire at such a fast pace than in the past. So the redundancies, and you take a look at how the airline is working, I really do think that it’s something that we take care of over time and are able to do in a really cooperative way with all of our employees. Doug Parker This is Doug now. So thanks for asking, Mary, because we worry. It’s important that we let our shareholders know where we think our cost structure may be headed, but we care a lot more about how our team knows they are going to be treated going forward. So we get really nervous when we start talking about redundancies, and that’s why we are being very careful about what we see in the future. The last thing we want our team to think is that we have some large reduction in force coming because we are not going to do that. We are here because of our team. And to the extent we have the ability to manage the airlines, we get to one airline with fewer people, we will make sure we do that in a way that is cognizant and respectful of the people that have gotten it to here. So we will manage that through attrition and we will manage it through, perhaps, early outs. We will do all sorts of things to make sure we do it right. By no means are we going to do something that doesn’t fully respect all of those that got us to this point. Operator We will go next to Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to check on the RASM outlook. I think Robert said 1 Q RASM will be up 2.5% to 4.5%, and you will have positive year-over-year RASM every quarter of 2017. Is that correct? Robert Isom That’s what we said, yes. Susan Carey Okay, good. Secondly, do you guys want to say anything or – secondly, what kind of comment do you have about what Alan Joyce said overnight about you resubmitting your API with Qantas to the DOT? Andrew Nocella This is Andrew. We are excited to get this resolved with the DOT. We think there is a lot of consumer benefits and we are anxious to make our case and get a fair review going forward. So we will get that going in the near future. Susan Carey Well, Mr. Joyce did not say he’s going to do it. He said you may do it, and he’s going to think about it and later tell us what you are going to do. Am I misunderstanding that you actually are going forward with this? Andrew Nocella I think we intend to refile. Susan Carey Okay. Thank you. Doug Parker Thanks, Susan. Operator We will go next to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Doug Parker Hi, Andrea. Andrea Ahles Hello, good morning. Sort of continuing on with what Susan was asking with the Qantas deal, are there other initiatives or things that you are thinking about either refiling or talking with the Trump administration now that we have a new Presidential administration in office, different policy ideas you think that you are advocating for that you think that the administration might be more receptive to than the previous one? Doug Parker Sure. Well, as Andrew said we are hopeful that the Trump administration will give the Qantas JV application a second and more favorable look. We also have an industry effort underway, United and Delta and American together are advocating that the United States government take another look at the Open Skies agreement with the Gulf countries. It’s pretty well-known. A hallmark of the Trump campaign and certainly something that we’ve heard a lot about in the first few days of the administration is the President’s focus on making the world economy one in which American companies can compete better and we think our Gulf carriers campaign is very much that. So we are looking forward to having the opportunity to speak with the new administration, the new State Department, the new DOT about that campaign as well. Andrea Ahles Have you had any discussions yet with the new administration? Doug Parker Well, no, because the new administration, while the President is in place and very energetically starting to his administration, the rest of the agencies that are important to us haven’t been stood up yet and secretaries haven’t been confirmed. Andrea Ahles All right. Thank you. Doug Parker Thanks, Andrea. Operator We’ll go next to David Koenig with the Associated Press. Doug Parker Hi, David. David Koenig Well, my question was really asked and answered but let me use of the floor. This is for Robert, and I wanted to follow up on one of the analysts who asked about your upcoming op challenges. So, Robert, could you please take another run at that answer? What specific investments are going to improve on time, are going to improve bag handling? How would you summarize that or explain that in terms that ordinary passengers and even a dumb reporter can understand? Robert Isom Sure. So in terms of on-time performance, on-time performance is generally a function of your schedule that you produce and maintenance reliability and then how well you execute day in and day out. The investment that we’ve made in bolstering our maintenance capabilities in our hub is significant with both manpower and systems and parts which is going to pay off. In terms of better decision- making, you are aware of the Integrated Operations Center that we’ve built which is state-of-the-art. I think best in the industry, and we are going to be able to take full advantage of that now that we are integrated. So the integration and having aircraft that are fully swappable throughout the system provides backup that we really didn’t have in many places before. So I do think that we are going to have a material impact in terms of on-time performance and in terms of completion factor and those will reduce cancellation or delays and mis-connected customers. I think there are scheduling opportunities that we can take a look at to make sure that we optimize our schedule for efficiency and making sure that we have redundancies where we need them and that’s a process that we are really finally getting started in earnest, as well. So we will start with a better schedule and we will have more tools out there. Now when things do go wrong with either mishandled baggage or passengers mis-connected or disrupted because of weather or whatever, we don’t have the tools today. But fortunately we’ve invested in automation that will help us, again, reunite customers with baggage and then also getting customers back on the way. So on those fronts today we don’t have a dynamic re- accommodation tool for our customers where they can go directly to the web or mobile to be able to get on new itinerary. That’s something that we will be incrementally rolling out over the next year and a half. There are new notification tools for customers in order to let them know what’s going on with their trip and with bags that we will be rolling out over the course of the next 12 months, which is fantastic. And so whether it’s baggage, whether it’s on- time performance, whether it’s the whole overall experience we are going to be doing a better job and, again, I think most of these things are upside for us that some others in the industry already have in position. David Koenig Okay. Thanks. Doug Parker Thanks. David. I don’t think we’ve ever done this before, but we are running out of time. One of the things we like to do at American, at certainly the new American is same day we announce earnings we go have a big system-wide call with the all of our employees that have been calling in here but what is going on the state of the airline with live downstairs with people that are here, but also for people listening in. And that is due to start in 10 minutes. We need to get downstairs. So apologies if we are cutting anyone off. I think we have time for two more. So operator, two more please. Operator Thank you. We’ll go next to Alana Wise with Reuters. Alana Wise Hi, good morning, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to ask quickly about American’s interest in possibly reworking the joint venture with Qantas now that Trump is in office. They told us yesterday that you currently reviewing the process of refiling the paperwork and that they have been reviewing the implications on how to cooperate on routes. So I’m just curious if this is something that American is currently looking into? Steve Johnson Hi, this is Steve. One of the reporters asked that question a couple of minutes ago, and we answered it more fully. But I will just say in the interest of time, yes, we do plan… Alana Wise Apologizes. Steve Johnson No problem at all. We do plan to refile the application with Qantas. It probably is a few weeks down the road just for the reason that I mentioned before is that the new administration isn’t in place yet, but we are looking forward to doing that and having another opportunity to make our case. Alana Wise And as a quick follow-up, I’m curious about Trump yesterday, the administration the other day saying that they are going to implement a border tax and what American thoughts on that are? Steve Johnson Well, I never like to talk about politics or religion on earnings call. So I’m going to pass. Doug Parker Thank you. Alana Wise Thank you. Operator Our final question will come from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell Hi, thank you for taking my question today. What is the status of the JV with LatAm? I know that’s been pending for a while now. Steve Johnson We filed that application… Doug Parker This is Steve again. Steve Johnson Yes, Steve Johnson, again. We filed that application sometime early in 2016. We also filed similar applications in the other countries that are relevant to the JV, most especially Chile and Brazil. The United States application is not going to be acted upon by the DOT until the Congress in Brazil ratifies the Open Skies treaty with the United States. We don’t know when that is going to occur, but you won’t see much action at the DOT until then. And then we’d expect it’s a complicated process and a pretty significant joint venture. So I would expect it would be another nine to 12 months at least after that happens before we have an answer for you. Edward Russell Understood. Great, thank you so much. Doug Parker Great. Thanks. Thanks everybody. Apologies if we didn’t get to your questions. Obviously, onto corporate communications and they will be happy to get you responses or if it’s investor questions call into Dan Cravens, Investor Relations. Thank you all very, very much for your interest. These are exciting times for us at American. We appreciate your interest in all that we have going on. Talk you soon. Thanks, bye.

The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. Rajeev Lalwani Hi, good morning. Thanks for the time. Doug Parker Hey, Rajeev. Rajeev Lalwani Just first question for you, can you just walk through the approach that you are taking with Basic Economy. Just color on how you’re thinking about domestic versus international, the market, the rollout timeline and so on. And then just specific benefits you are looking for in 2017 on Basic Economy? Robert Isom Well, Don Casey can help me out, but the idea behind Basic Economy and Premium Economy is segmentation and getting a product and a price to customers at every stage of the demand curve. And so the game plan right now is that we are going to be really smart in terms of how we roll out Basic Economy. We are going to start with 10 different markets and that will start here in the next couple of months. And from there we plan to roll it out and to make sure that we can do it effectively at the airports and to really understand how our customers react, as well. Our hope is to have it fully rolled out over the course of 2017 and early 2018 throughout our domestic network. Right now that’s where we stand. From a Premium Economy perspective, of course that’s starting with our international fleet and with the 787-900s, and then from there we will be reconfiguring our fleet, our widebody fleet to allow that to be sold throughout the international network. So we do continue to see the demand for the product. And we think that it’s going to really help us with competition from low-cost carriers and defending our hub. Don? Don Casey Yes, clearly the product features that we have are not changeable, not upgradable, reduced elite qualifying miles as well as no seat selection in our effective barriers for business customers. This is really all about tapping into the willingness to pay for existing product that’s difficult to get at given the current distribution model which just shows the lowest fare. So those product attributes we think business customers are going to be interested in paying a bit more for our product that we offer today. And as we’ve talked to our appropriate customers since we’ve made the announcement they don’t want us to distribute the basic product to them because they don’t see it as attractive. But there’s also an opportunity, we believe, to capture an increased willingness to pay for leisure customers, as well, that are buying further out. And for that we think the carry-on bag restriction or the checked bag-only policy related to the product is actually quite critical to tapping into the willingness to pay for leisure customers. Rajeev Lalwani And in terms of that $1 billion of benefit that you talked about for Basic and Premium, how much is for Basic? Doug Parker This is Doug. I don’t know that we have broken it out. But anyway, know that we believe the value is there, and as Robert just described given the size of the value we want to get there as quickly as we can. We also need to make sure we manage it properly. So as anxious as we are to get it in throughout the system we are not going to go in a way that we can’t manage well and our people can’t manage well. So I think as you go to model this side I would, again, if it were me I wouldn’t build a whole lot into 2017 because we are going to ramp it up, but and then hopefully we will surprise you on the upside, but know that it’s going to be there in 2018. Rajeev Lalwani Okay. And then Doug, a question for you. In terms of domestic capacity you are keeping it flat this year obviously. When does that start to reverse itself and what are the metrics you are looking at to figure out whether or not to start pushing it up? It seems like the RASM trends are clearly in your favor, so just how you are thinking about it. Andrew Nocella Yes, this is Andrew. It’s flat this year. As we look at the balance of international versus domestic it wouldn’t shock me if we slightly toned down international and add a little bit to domestic this year, but that’s not the current plan. We will just watch the trend. And if those trends continue I tend think you’ll see a little bit more next year given that’s where the RASM growth seems to be given the international environment capacity and demand environment right now. Rajeev Lalwani Thank you, gentlemen. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Doug Parker Hey, Duane. Duane Pfennigwerth Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just on January, I know you don’t disclose monthly but can you give any sense for trends that you are seeing in South Florida and perhaps the Northeast so far in the month of January? Doug Parker Is there something specific you think we should be seeing that you are asking? Duane Pfennigwerth Just if there is anything off-trend specifically in South Florida as you rolled up, as you started January relative to the rest of the network. Andrew Nocella This is Andrew. I think capacity in South Florida and the Caribbean is really elevated. So it is putting pressure on our Miami hub and I think all South Florida operations. That looks like it’s going to continue for the next few months or quarters at this rate. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay. And then on regional capacity I just had a minor detail question. It looks like you are modestly down year-over-year as we roll through the year and you are taking some deliveries. So just wondering is that optimal or was this a function of pilot availability constraints? Can you just talk through the mix shift there? Andrew Nocella I’m not sure I’d say it was optimal. We are working through our regional jet requirements and making an assessment of where we want to be for 2018. We did as you see from the stats reduced departures and grow ASMs, and we’d like that trend and we did, in fact, plan for that. As we look forward for next year I do think we will stop shrinking the regional capacity at this rate because we don’t want to cut our scheduled depth far more than we already have. Duane Pfennigwerth Okay, that’s great. Thanks for taking the questions. Out of respect for the other people on the phone I will keep it there. Thank you. Doug Parker Awesome, thanks, Duane. Operator Our next question comes from Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi Hi guys. Thanks for the time. I guess, Derek, I think you said you had some cost reduction initiatives that would help your numbers in 2018 and 2019. Can you give us a sense of what the magnitude of these things might be? Derek Kerr We really haven’t gone through that process yet, so as we talked about on the last call there’s opportunities. We just haven’t been through it. When we get through all of the work we are going to do on it in 2017 we will give you some guidance going into 2018. We have given you where we think 2017 is going to be and it comes down throughout the year. But as we’ve talked about on last calls I believe the next two years can be, obviously, no more than 2% and should be we can get it below that. So we haven’t really gone through it. We are not going to peg a number at this point in time. But we will give you more as the year goes on probably at the end of the year as we go into 2018. Darryl Genovesi Okay. Doug Parker We understand your desire to know more. We just don’t have much to tell you at this point because we need to go do the work. We, frankly, haven’t spent a lot of time doing that just yet because it’s a ways off because we are still working through the integration. But we wouldn’t mention it if we didn’t think it was a material number, but we don’t have any idea what it is yet. And we wouldn’t want to give you a number and not have it be something we’ve given more thought to it. Darryl Genovesi Okay. And then I guess if I can just ask you a little bit more about 2017 and specifically on free cash flow, Derek, you just took everything you knew today with your pension contributions that you laid out and then whatever you think is an appropriate revenue assumption for the year, would you expect to generate free cash flow this year? Derek Kerr Well, we haven’t given you the full year on RASM. So I think that would give you an answer of what we think our RASM is going to be for the year. I mean – no, no. What I was going to say is we have the aircraft CapEx at $4 billion. We’ve talked about continuing to finance aircraft. We believe we will finance somewhere in the 70%, 75% of that range, so if you take that with the debt payments at $2.1 billion and the pension payment at $300 million, you can use that information to get where you are with whatever your RASM number is for the full year. Darryl Genovesi And then if I could just squeak one in for Robert or Don, I think you’ve said that your Basic Economy product is going to allow you to compete more effectively with ultra low-cost carriers. But I guess I was wondering once you think Basic Economy is fully ramped up, would you expect to be putting more inventory or less inventory towards matching Spirit and Frontier and those kind of competitors down the road than you do today? Don Casey From an inventory perspective, I mean both the main cabin product and the Basic product they share the same inventory. So we are always going to have both products available for our customers. But we will continue to match the ultra low-cost carrier pricing with our Basic product and the Basic product is going to exist on all of the flights that we operate in each market. Darryl Genovesi Okay, thanks guys. Operator Our next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Doug Parker Hi. Hunter Keay Good morning. So thanks for the – I’m going to come at one of Darryl’s questions a little bit of a different way. In terms of the cost savings opportunities, can you maybe give us some context in terms of the overall opportunity as it relates to the outlook for the next couple of years? Which do you think is a greater opportunity for you to close the margin gap or to get your margins where you want them to be, is maybe a better way of putting it, revenues or costs? Which is the greater degree of opportunity? Doug Parker It’s not even close. It’s cost – it’s revenue. So you can do the analysis here, Hunter. If you look at our gap in margin versus Delta it’s more than 100% revenue, so that’s where it is. That’s the good news, by the way, because that is, one, you are starting to see it close now and we have a number of initiatives that we have to put in place that they to their credit already have in place like Basic Economy. And a number of other things that Don and Robert can talk about, but that’s where the upside is without a doubt. The leverage in this company is in revenue performance to closing the revenue gap, that’s why we are investing so much in the product and that’s why we are investing in the team because we know that’s where the leverage is. It is to close that revenue gap and that is the entirety of the margin gap, indeed it’s more than 100% of it. Hunter Keay Okay. So is that regaining lost share or is that growing the wallet share from your existing customers? Doug Parker Well, again, I will turn it over to the experts first who can give you more details. But know this. Some of it is just where we fly. If you have a large operation in Latin America right now, while that’s a source of the improvement year-over-year it’s also the lowest margin client in the world right now. So some of it, and you will see this from time to time in each of our airlines as we move forward, there will be certain pockets that we fly to that are producing lower margin and others just because the world economies vary. But that’s not the entirety of it by any means. I just want to point that one out. So you see some of that. But look American Airlines are not too long ago didn’t have a RASM gap to Delta Airlines. We’ve gone through a lot. And they’ve been well ahead of us in terms of getting a merger done and being ahead. So that’s where the upside is, and, again, I will let Robert and Don give you more details. Derek Kerr Hunter, I think it’s a combination of both. It’s making sure we get our fair share and growing the pie too. So look, the categories that we’ve got ahead of us and now that so many of the merger constraints and integration are behind us, really exciting to go out and pursue it. As Doug said, many of these things are really things that other carriers have, frankly, had the chance to go pursue. So we are working on schedule and simplifying our design and our rollout for that and potential disruption as we move from schedule to schedule. We think that there is a lot of advantage to that. You know about Basic Economy, you know about Premium Economy. We think that there are things that can be done even further where we are with those categories in terms of rolling out quicker and potentially expanding into other regions. Long-haul interior improvements, you know we are in the final stages of the conversion of our 777-200 and having lie flat seats for all of our international widebody service. And that’s very exciting and showing a lot of results. There was density that came with that, as well. We think that there is actually additional opportunities in terms of density specifically in our narrowbody fleet that we’d like to consider that, again, would get us back to where others in the industry are. There’s work that we are doing in our sales organization, as well. I will let Andrew talk a little bit about this, and I want Don to speak to some of the revenue management issues. But, quite frankly, we have not invested in our salesforce really as we’d like and should have, and that’s had an impact over the last few years. And we are going to turn that around. So with that, Don, why don’t you talk a little bit about your arm stuff and Andrew maybe a little bit more on sales, too? Don Casey Yes, just to touch, basically go back quickly to the segmentation. All the segmentation we are doing, as I mentioned earlier, is it’s just capturing willingness to pay that we are unable to capture without the discounted segmentation model. And that’s really growing the pie. We don’t have to take traffic from anyone else to be able to increase revenues. Just on the revenue management side of things we’ve been on a journey here for the last few years for reinventing how we do yield management and revenue management here at American Airlines. We already started in the summer of 2015 when we launched – got a new forecaster, but the new forecaster isn’t really just a black box that suddenly now gives a different number. We completely redid the entire workflow and process within our yield management function. And that was a very, very big change of management process. So we changed the role of the analyst, what they do, how they do it and what they focus on. It did take a while for us to bed that down and get our feet underneath us. Certainly some of the benefit that we’ve seen over the last six months is just better execution on the YM side of the business as we get better and better at the execution in our new field management process. And we’re really not done with that either. That’s really just the first step down this path. We have implemented an entirely new inventory system in October that gives us a lot more capabilities based on the new inventory system and the structure we’ve created in our forecasting model. We’ve implemented a new optimizer which, again, optimizes revenue across the network. That was done in November. And at the same time we’ve reorganized the way we use our inventories which gave us more inventories. We are selling the premium cabin in our domestic business. And we have seen quite material benefits of that, as well. But the optimizer, the new inventory system, more inventories for selling premium product, those are benefits that are going to materialize as we look forward. Hunter Keay All right, thanks. Andrew Nocella On the sales front, Hunter, I think as we look back over the last 12 to 18 months we undersized the salesforce, we have not enough boots on the ground to deal with the potential of corporate contracted revenue that’s out there. That’s, obviously, some of the best revenue in the pool to grab, so we are taking a close look at that. We are going to expand the salesforce. We have worked a lot of process out so we can empower the salesforce to be much more competitive out there. And we do think as we look at the number of contracts we have relative to our primary competitors we have fewer. We are going to close that gap over the next 12 months. We just brought in a new global senior salesperson, Alison Taylor, who is leading that effort. And it’s going to have a really, I think meaningful impact, over the next 12 to 18 months. Doug Parker Look, Hunter, so of all that you just heard I mean everything, most everything Don talked about is not share shift but actually just doing a better job with the existing revenue base. And then what Andrew talked about, obviously, is just getting back to our natural share. It’s not trying to go steal share. We’ve gotten to a point where we have less of that traffic that Andrew talked about that we believe in airline of our size and quality should. So we are going to given all the investment we’ve made we believe it’s natural we should get that share back. Look without, anyway, I will give you my best guess. It’s 80% of the gap closure is going to be doing a better job of just managing our revenues better and 20% of it is getting back some of our natural share. Hunter Keay Yes, that’s great. Begs a lot a follow-up questions, but I will leave it there. Thank you so much. Doug Parker Thanks, Hunter. Operator [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie Baker Hey. Good morning, Doug. I will let somebody else ask you about relative margins for a change. My question has to do with costs. I know that you attribute the bulk of 2017 CASM to labor. I get that. But what am trying to understand is whether all the investments in the business, investments that hopefully allow you to run as efficient an airline as Delta, are these investments currently being made or is that more of a 2018 issue? The reason I ask is that I don’t want to be too optimistic in believing that you could have the best year-on-year cost performance of any airline next year as we anniversary labor. I guess another way of asking is whether you believe you will be running the airline you want to be running by the end of this year or is there still a lot of cost wood to chop in 2018? Let me put it that way. Doug Parker Can you say it again? I just want to make sure I got you right. Jamie Baker All right. What’s your 2018 ex-fuel CASM forecast? Simple enough, but if you want to confuse that with revenue you can tell me that number. Doug Parker Look, I think we’ve tried to answer that. Here is what we believe. And once we get through what we’ve built into our 2018 plan for expenses, we believe, I’m sorry, 2017, thanks Derek, we believe in 2017 what we have built into our 2017 expenses and therefore what you see in what Derek gave you for guidance, we believe we have everything we need to go compete. Jamie Baker Okay. Doug Parker So and, again, that’s the belief. Other airlines go and make other changes. We may need to adjust accordingly, of course, so caveat as we should. But this isn’t, we feel really good about once we get through 2017 we’ve got the investment in the airline we need to go run it. Look, I’ve got to tell you there’s one other thing going on, though, as you should know which is the reason we have a cost advantage that I talked about is because we still have some of our employees making less than are being paid at other airlines. That’s something that, again, we have contracts in place and things like that that you need to be thinking of that as you go forward. You should not expect that we are going to try and run our airline as we sign new contracts with a cost advantage versus those airlines because we don’t intend to. Our people are the best there are. So know that. That cost advantage no one should expect to be long-term sustainable. Jamie Baker Okay, understood. I appreciate that. And the second question for Bev. Could you just outline with a little bit more granularity, and feel free to geek out if you want to, what are the relevant integration exercises that are yet to take place and what’s the approximate timing and approximate risk of each one, or associated with each one? Bev Goulet Well, Jamie, you know me well enough to know that I like to geek out. But I will try to… Jamie Baker We’ve known each other a while. Bev Goulet Really three major projects left to get done. First of all is getting our flight attendants into a common system. Hard at work on that right now. It’s a complicated matter. We are essentially taking an LUS contract and modifying the LAA system to accommodate it. But a lot of really good work going on right now. You know, we don’t have a firm plan yet, but we are optimistic within the next 12-plus months we ought to see something there. Also putting in a state-of-the-art HR and payroll system, again a lot of work there when you consider that it covers 650,000 people or so. And then finally we don’t have our tech ops organization integrated yet. And that is a long-term process, best case probably another three to four years. Jamie Baker Okay, very good. Thanks to both of you. I appreciate it. Good luck. Doug Parker Thanks, Jamie. Jamie Baker Thanks, Doug. Operator We will go next to Savi Syth with Raymond James. Savi Syth Hey. Good morning. So I just wanted to ask on the cash returned to shareholder standpoint, I’m guessing we are going to get a slowdown from the last couple of years. But just wanted to maybe understand a little bit better how you think about that regarding share buyback and also dividends. I know from a dividend yield standpoint you are kind of behind some of your competitors. How do you think about those items? Doug Parker Okay, we’ve got to be a little careful about what we talk about, obviously, in the future and how we plan to return – how we plan to redistribute to shareholders, but I will say this. We are happy with the dividend that we are providing shareholders at this point. As we talk to our shareholders, at least those shareholders of American Airlines today they seem more excited about share repurchase activity, the dividend activity. That, of course, could change and we will keep talking to them. So as it relates to the share repurchase, I will let Derek talk about where we are on that activity. Derek Kerr I think the third and fourth quarter slowed down versus the first and second quarter as we, the two things that we did is we looked at our minimum cash levels and we’ve raised that from 6.5 to 7. So we have probably less excess cash than we have had since the beginning of the merger. So I would expect it to slow down a little bit, but that all depends on timing and where we go with things and what the forecast looks like. So I would hate to project what we are going to do during the year. We just announced the new $2 billion program, so I won’t project how quick we are going to do that. It all depends on what the outlook looks like moving forward and where we are going to end the year and we adjust it quarterly depending on how everything looks. Doug Parker I will just add this. We remain bullish, that’s for sure. Derek Kerr Yes. Doug Parker We talked at length about the upside we think we have on the revenue side. And we continue to believe the industry in total is being undervalued just because of shareholders who are concerned that this really, the issue really hasn’t changed the way we believe it has. So we are really quite bullish. We think there’s now some – we think the industry multiples are lower than they should be and within the industry we think American has more upside than anyone else. So long as we continue to produce earnings that we expect, so long as having used those to continue to invest in the business at the level we think makes sense, which by the way we are investing more capital in this airline than has ever been invested in an airline in the history of commercial aviation and we are proud of that. We are going to be putting out a product that’s so much different than what the customers of American have seen in the past as we move forward. And we are excited about the that. But, anyway, as we continue to be able to do that to the level we need to and we still continue to have excess cash which we expect we will be returning that to our shareholders as we should, particularly at peak moments. Savi Syth That’s helpful. Thanks, Doug. And if I may follow up with you are coming, gone through most of the integration process here. I think there was talk about maybe having an Analyst Day this year. Just thoughts on that, and then maybe what we should expect from it. Derek Kerr Yes, I think we are still working through that. It most likely we will have it later in the back half of the year, probably in the third of fourth quarter. No expectations yet. I mean we have – we’ll go through where we are at that point in time. But our plan is to have one later in the year and have a Media and Analyst Day at the same time. Savi Syth Great, thank you. Operator We will next to Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research. Doug Parker Hey, Dan. Dan McKenzie Good morning, thanks guys. Well, leave it to me to kick a dead horse here because you guys gave a really good answer on the margin parity question. I just wonder if I can put a little finer point on it. At least as I look at it there’s about $3 billion in revenue that needs to be made up. And Doug, I appreciate your commentary. You’ve got some geographic exposure which I put at a $2 billion revenue hit. So at least as we think about today, should we think about this as a three-year catch up, a five-year plan, a four-year plan? And I guess as we look at these categories that you laid out for us this morning, do they really capture that $3 billion deficit, or are there other initiatives that need to yet be rolled out at some point? Doug Parker Okay, Dan. Really hard to say how many, particularly when you are talking about the piece that is related to global economies, when they return and where those go. So as I know you appreciate hard for us to – and by the way, we are not endorsing your split between how much of that is the relative economies versus things we can do. But you can do that work and come up with whatever number you’d like. But there are certainly some related to that. Of the things that we can control, all the initiatives we’ve talked about, I think, again, you will see a lot of it start to come in 2017 but not be full run rate 2017. Certainly things like Basic Economy. By 2018 you see I don’t know, Don, I don’t want to hang you out there too far. What would you say 2017 versus 2018 – or the 2018 kind of the run rate on these type of revenue initially? Don Casey Well, I mean it – it really varies by very dramatically by initiative, initiative by initiative. The big ones we have talked about, so Premium Economy or Basic Economy, reality is they’re probably going to be 20% this year and 80% next year just based on the where we are in terms of the rollout plan. Some of the things we are doing in the sales side of the business and we are doing on the revenue management side of the business we are going to get to probably I’d say about 60% to 70% of that probably in 2017, the rest of it coming in 2017. Doug Parker So anyway, the short answer is yes, we believe we can close all of it. Clearly the economies may vary and we will see. And we think we can do the majority of that through 2018. Dan McKenzie I appreciate the clarification. Thanks. I guess… Doug Parker And, again, I probably should be clear, completing it in 2018 then really closing in more 2019. Dan McKenzie Understood. Robert, I appreciate the commentary on improved ops. But what are the specific goals as you look ahead, what have been the biggest challenges? And I’m guessing that those might have been tied to the MD-80s and the 767s, and I guess just as you think about the ops, how much of an earnings tailwind do you think a better operation is going to be in 2017 versus what you experienced in 2016? Robert Isom Well, if you take a look at the last few years I think we’ve had our hands full with integrating the airline. In many respects we’ve run two if not three separate systems when you think about pilots, flight attendants and the aircraft. The great news is we got our pilots and our aircraft altogether. That allows us to start making sure that we have our hubs set up and resourced appropriately. It takes a lot of complexity out of the system. Big upside for us I think is completion factor. Big upside I think is production of mis-connected customers. And then when you take a look at the rework that defaults with the off-schedule operation, I can probably talk more about this, we have a lot of investments we’ve been making in the last three years on top of integrating that are going to come to fruition in the next couple of years. So, for instance, in terms of bag mishandling I think there’s a step function improvement that we’re headed towards, not the least of which is just due to general improved operations but also technology that will help us reunite customers with mishandled bags in a much more expedited and hopefully cost-effective fashion. And so that’s going to be a benefit. I think in irregular operation, which has been really the biggest source of issue and concern with customers, it’s tough to put together two systems as opposed to one when things go off schedule. And the good news on that front is we have tools, technology both to get our aircraft and our crews and, importantly, our customers to give them choice to get back on schedule without having to wait in a line or go straight to reservations. That technology I think is all keyed up to come out this year and in 2018, and it’s going to be, again, a big step function improvement for us and something that other competitors have already done. Dan McKenzie Thanks for that clarification. I appreciate it. Robert Isom Thank you. Operator We will go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi Hey. Thank you very much. So Derek, when you guys announced your credit card agreement over the summer, you indicated that the incremental revenue from that was 100% margin. Essentially that the pre-tax income matched the revenue, in other words. So it’s clear that there is no recurring cost allocated against that revenue. If that’s the case, why shouldn’t we think of the $1.5 billion in marketing revenue you guys disclosed in the 2015 10-K as similarly a very, very high-margin revenue, say over 90%? Doug Parker Okay. Hey, Joe, it’s Doug. I’m sorry, what’s… Derek Kerr I think, Joe, what we had said at that point in time, you are right, because all that changed in that transaction was a higher dollar amount for each mile paid. So, in other words, the program was in place, we were getting X for what we were for those miles and that number went up and changed. So that increase was, but the base program is not all incremental and not all single margin, but that increase at that point in time was just a higher paid fee to us per mile. Doug Parker [Indiscernible] $1.5 billion number he’s talking about? Derek Kerr Well, we announced that it was going to be $200 million in the first year, $250 million in the first year, $500 million in the second year and $800 million in the third year. So that was the three-year combination to get to the $1.5 billion of the increase for the next year. Joseph DeNardi Derek, just do so I’m clear, the $1.5 billion you guys in your 2015 10-K disclosed that marketing revenue from the credit card was $1.5 billion. That’s separate from what you announced over the summer. I guess what I’m asking is… Doug Parker Thanks. That’s what I was trying to get at. Okay. So you gave a number for the 2015 K, we’re $1.5 billion. We’ve disclosed that we have indeed signed a new contract and we’ve talked you about the incremental increase. But I think you should add those two numbers and come to a total number, butit’sup to you to decide how to estimate where we are now. So anyway look, as Derek was saying the increase is entirely due to just getting a higher rate per mile for the credit card. So, of course, that will fall almost entirely to the bottom line. Now the initial $1.5 billion you’re talking about, that number is the number that we were collecting at that point in time and, of course, we have to redeem those miles. So there is some cost to that, costs we don’t disclose. But you can rightfully assume that it’s a nicely profitable business or we wouldn’t do it. So we were happy with what we were collecting before the new agreement and now we have a new agreement where we are collecting more. So those I think are facts as we can disclose them. But look, on a bigger point I just want to point out, Joe, you know we’ve noticed what you’ve written on this and look, we agree with you. This is the amount of revenues that the airlines, and particularly American, collect on our – on these marketing agreements, these credit card agreements are different kinds of cash flows than airline cash flows. They are tied to purchases on credit cards not due to airline economy. So I think you are right to suggest that investors should look, should do their best to look through and understand the level of those cash flows and the certainty of them. To which point you are going to say, well, then why don’t you give us more information? And which we will tell you we are tied to confidentiality. But let us go work on it. Let us figure out what we can do to give you more information. I think it is important to our shareholders. I think it is an area where shareholders have understood more how much of our profits and how much of our revenues are tied to things that aren’t really related to the ups and downs of the airline environment, that they would have even a better appreciation for why we are so bullish on this airline. And as we do that what you would learn, of course, is that there is none better than the American Airlines AAdvantage program and our relationship with two providers Citi and Barclays. So we agree with you. Just let us do what we can. We have to live within agreements and we can’t violate those, of course. And we won’t, but we also want to do our best to let our shareholders understand the certainty of the cash flows. Joseph DeNardi Okay, I will leave it there. Thank you. Doug Parker Thank you. Operator We will go next to Helane Baker with Cowen and Company. Doug Parker Did you say… Helane Becker Thanks. Hi guys, it’s Helane Becker. I just have, okay, so first I just have one housekeeping question. I just want to understand RASM improvement, is it sequential, you are talking about the improvement for – you are talking about positive for the year, but are you also talking about sequential improvement from one quarter, two quarter and so on? Doug Parker All the numbers we give are year-over-year numbers. Derek Kerr Yes. Helane Becker Okay, then fine. Thank you. My other question, Doug, when you think about the Atlantic and the numbers that you provided and you see the capacity growth that’s coming from especially the low-cost carriers, if you don’t grow, or if you shrink too much you cede market share and that puts you, I would think, longer term in a tougher position because your goal is, obviously, to be the best. Not necessarily the largest, but certainly the best and to want business travelers to choose American first. And I’m just trying to make sure I understand that the changes that you are talking about making aren’t going to put you in a position where yields just keep declining in that market as these new low-cost competitors come in. Andrew Nocella Well, Helane, this is Andrew. I think American’s position across the Atlantic combined with our joint venture partners, particularly British Airways, is really strong. What we did in the first quarter was cull some flying that was incredibly unprofitable, so you see our ASM shrinking just a bit. But that capacity has moved to the third quarter which is a lot more lucrative for us and, obviously, the industry. So we’ve moved capacity where we think it needs to be. We don’t intend to cede our position across the Atlantic to anybody. And we are working with our JV partners to make sure we have an effective plan going forward to compete. And that is continued segmentation of the product as we talked about for the future. So we feel bullish about that. It’s definitely going to be a really tough competitive environment, particularly I think over the next year, year and a half as we see these capacity inflows. But our position is it’s good, London Heathrow is the best hub in Europe and we feel good about it. Helane Becker Okay, great. Thank you. Those were two of my questions. And I will turn the mic over. Thank you. Andrew Nocella Thanks, Helane. Operator We will go next to David Vernon with Bernstein. Doug Parker Hi, David. David Vernon Hey guys, thanks for making the time. Just a question for you on the cadence of changes in the ASM forecast. Obviously, you are starting off with very good guidance on the TRASM number. If market conditions stay where they are, should we expect a pickup in the rate of ASM growth to be a little bit of a headwind on that number? Or is that not going to be as sensitive as the unit cost number? Derek Kerr You mean the pickup on ASMs versus… David Vernon Yes, it seems like the ASMs dip and then they accelerate to about 2.4% by the end of the year. I’m just wondering if the unit revenue growth that we should be expecting would be impacted by that changing mix at all? Obviously, I would think it’s impacting the unit cost growth a little bit. As you get more volume you are seeing a lower rate of unit increase. Doug Parker We are not giving forward RASM growth. But absolutely, if you see higher growth in ASMs, all else equal you would expect to see the RASM growth decline and the CASM growth decline. That’s correct. So, again, make your own revenue forecast, but certainly capacity growth matters. David Vernon Yes, I was just looking to make sure that there wasn’t something I was missing in that if there was anything specific… Doug Parker No, you’re not. Okay David Vernon And then as you think about the guidance on interest expense, the step-up of $90 million or so, is that anticipating additional leverage or is that just associated with some of the variable-rate debt? Derek Kerr There is a little bit of increase in debt just due to the aircraft coming on. So it’s really driven by the year-over-year increase in debt is that because we took some on last year. Project debt to be up somewhere, net debt to be up or total debt to be up somewhere in the $800 million range, so just slightly up in 2017. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Didora of Bank of America. Doug Parker Hi Andrew. Andrew Didora Hi, good morning everyone. Just one question, one for Robert as a follow-up on Basic Economy. It’s clearly an offering that you and your competitors think will be a nice positive. Whenever I hear that I tend to question it a little bit what everybody thinks is going to be good. But I guess what do you see as the biggest risk in the product and maybe Robert what are the key metrics that you will be watching just to judge whether this product is a success or not? Robert Isom The risk that I see out there is really execution. So making sure that we have our customers educated on the product and our airports and employees all set to deliver I think is the big risk. But in terms of performance we are going to be watching it on all fronts, certainly from an operations perspective. But revenue performance is what this is designed to address. And so on all levels we will be keeping an eye. Don? Don Casey Obviously, the key thing is trying to figure out what the price premium can be for the main cabin product compared to Basic. And that is going to be a function of the competitive environment. And we are just going to have to figure that out as we go. Obviously, where we compete with Southwest but that does not have a bag fee we are going to have to, again, test to see what kind of premium we can get for our main cabin product versus the Basic product. Andrew Didora Can you give us a sense for just in terms of that premium what the way you see demand shaping up for the Basic Economy product what you think is a reasonable revenue premium? Don Casey Our pricing for the product is going to be in the marketplace in the middle of February. And so until we get the pricing in the market I don’t think we really can talk about what kind of premium we are going to see. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Michael Linenberg Hey, good morning everybody. Just two quick ones here for Derek. Derek, when we think about CapEx and debt I guess this is the year of the peak, 2017? Derek Kerr Right. Michael Linenberg Is that? Okay. Then just with respect to the pension, it looks like that you are either pulling some of the contributions forward? Or was there an accounting change there that’s driving you to the higher numbers? Derek Kerr No, we just pulled it forward into 2017 just to make sure that we are fully funded from an airline relief act. That’s the only thing that we did. We used to have $1.4 billion in 2017, we just pulled $300 million of it forward in 2017 and left the $1.1 billion in 2018. So that’s the only change to the pension payment. Michael Linenberg Okay. And then just on the pension, what was the liability at year-end and then those numbers that you threw out there for 2017 and 2018, presumably that’s still using a lower discount rate, right? Derek Kerr 2017 is. 2018 is not, because that’s when the relief act goes away. The liability, our total liability was $17 billion and our assets are about $10 billion. Michael Linenberg Okay, so let’s call it… Derek Kerr At the end of the year. Michael Linenberg Okay, very good. Derek Kerr That’s from a GAAP perspective. Michael Linenberg Absolutely. Okay, great. Thank you. Derek Kerr Thanks. Operator We would like to now take our questions from media. [Operator Instructions] Our first question come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Doug Parker Hi, Mary. Mary Schlangenstein Hi, that was close. I had two quick questions, please. The first is when Beth was talking about the FOS for flight attendants and she mentioned a 12-month time frame. Is that 12 months to have everything in place and done, or is that 12 months to get your plan and then have to put it in place? Bev Goulet Yes, Mary, I think I said 12-months plus. We are still working out the details of the plan and, obviously, the most important thing is to get it right. It’s complex, there’s a lot of change. We want to make sure we have our employees fully trained and ready to go. So we will be back to you a little bit later in terms of a firm plan. Mary Schlangenstein Okay. Are there any numbers or figures on how much you are not getting, how much of a benefit you are not getting by continuing to run two systems or I guess how much an extra cost that is? Robert Isom It’s hard to quantify it. But I will tell you what, the vast majority of the integration benefit is really with the aircraft being able to be moved around. So there is inefficiency in the system. But it’s something that really at the end of the day is more an issue that we want to get, we want to take care of for our employees, that they are able to be based where they want to in an unrestricted fashion so they have the benefit of moving around, as well. So we are trying to get it as quickly as possible but I can tell you the biggest benefit I think will be for our employees. Maya you want to… Mary Schlangenstein Okay. Maya Leibman Just to add to what Bev said, to your question, Mary, we will have a plan with a firm date no later than the end of this quarter. Doug Parker That was Maya Leibman. Mary Schlangenstein Right, right. Okay, great. So you would hope to have FOS in place or have the two flight attendants all integrated by the end of 12 months after that or the end of this year? Doug Parker It’s the best – we don’t – at the end of this quarter we will have a better idea of exactly. Mary Schlangenstein Media Of plan. Okay. Then quickly my second question was you’ve talked a couple of times about redundancies. And I know you staffed up to take part, to take care of some parts of the integration, especially the IT issues to make sure everything went well. When you are looking at redundancies is there a possibility of us seeing some job cuts at American? Doug Parker Right Robert Isom Look, when we talk about redundancies we’ve hired a lot of folks here over the last few years. I think some order of magnitude almost 20,000 employees when you take into account attrition that has happened, as well. My view is that as we take a look going forward we are going to continue to have attrition within the Company. And the real benefit comes in not having to hire at such a fast pace than in the past. So the redundancies, and you take a look at how the airline is working, I really do think that it’s something that we take care of over time and are able to do in a really cooperative way with all of our employees. Doug Parker This is Doug now. So thanks for asking, Mary, because we worry. It’s important that we let our shareholders know where we think our cost structure may be headed, but we care a lot more about how our team knows they are going to be treated going forward. So we get really nervous when we start talking about redundancies, and that’s why we are being very careful about what we see in the future. The last thing we want our team to think is that we have some large reduction in force coming because we are not going to do that. We are here because of our team. And to the extent we have the ability to manage the airlines, we get to one airline with fewer people, we will make sure we do that in a way that is cognizant and respectful of the people that have gotten it to here. So we will manage that through attrition and we will manage it through, perhaps, early outs. We will do all sorts of things to make sure we do it right. By no means are we going to do something that doesn’t fully respect all of those that got us to this point. Operator We will go next to Susan Carey with Wall Street Journal. Susan Carey Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to check on the RASM outlook. I think Robert said 1 Q RASM will be up 2.5% to 4.5%, and you will have positive year-over-year RASM every quarter of 2017. Is that correct? Robert Isom That’s what we said, yes. Susan Carey Okay, good. Secondly, do you guys want to say anything or – secondly, what kind of comment do you have about what Alan Joyce said overnight about you resubmitting your API with Qantas to the DOT? Andrew Nocella This is Andrew. We are excited to get this resolved with the DOT. We think there is a lot of consumer benefits and we are anxious to make our case and get a fair review going forward. So we will get that going in the near future. Susan Carey Well, Mr. Joyce did not say he’s going to do it. He said you may do it, and he’s going to think about it and later tell us what you are going to do. Am I misunderstanding that you actually are going forward with this? Andrew Nocella I think we intend to refile. Susan Carey Okay. Thank you. Doug Parker Thanks, Susan. Operator We will go next to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Doug Parker Hi, Andrea. Andrea Ahles Hello, good morning. Sort of continuing on with what Susan was asking with the Qantas deal, are there other initiatives or things that you are thinking about either refiling or talking with the Trump administration now that we have a new Presidential administration in office, different policy ideas you think that you are advocating for that you think that the administration might be more receptive to than the previous one? Doug Parker Sure. Well, as Andrew said we are hopeful that the Trump administration will give the Qantas JV application a second and more favorable look. We also have an industry effort underway, United and Delta and American together are advocating that the United States government take another look at the Open Skies agreement with the Gulf countries. It’s pretty well-known. A hallmark of the Trump campaign and certainly something that we’ve heard a lot about in the first few days of the administration is the President’s focus on making the world economy one in which American companies can compete better and we think our Gulf carriers campaign is very much that. So we are looking forward to having the opportunity to speak with the new administration, the new State Department, the new DOT about that campaign as well. Andrea Ahles Have you had any discussions yet with the new administration? Doug Parker Well, no, because the new administration, while the President is in place and very energetically starting to his administration, the rest of the agencies that are important to us haven’t been stood up yet and secretaries haven’t been confirmed. Andrea Ahles All right. Thank you. Doug Parker Thanks, Andrea. Operator We’ll go next to David Koenig with the Associated Press. Doug Parker Hi, David. David Koenig Well, my question was really asked and answered but let me use of the floor. This is for Robert, and I wanted to follow up on one of the analysts who asked about your upcoming op challenges. So, Robert, could you please take another run at that answer? What specific investments are going to improve on time, are going to improve bag handling? How would you summarize that or explain that in terms that ordinary passengers and even a dumb reporter can understand? Robert Isom Sure. So in terms of on-time performance, on-time performance is generally a function of your schedule that you produce and maintenance reliability and then how well you execute day in and day out. The investment that we’ve made in bolstering our maintenance capabilities in our hub is significant with both manpower and systems and parts which is going to pay off. In terms of better decision- making, you are aware of the Integrated Operations Center that we’ve built which is state-of-the-art. I think best in the industry, and we are going to be able to take full advantage of that now that we are integrated. So the integration and having aircraft that are fully swappable throughout the system provides backup that we really didn’t have in many places before. So I do think that we are going to have a material impact in terms of on-time performance and in terms of completion factor and those will reduce cancellation or delays and mis-connected customers. I think there are scheduling opportunities that we can take a look at to make sure that we optimize our schedule for efficiency and making sure that we have redundancies where we need them and that’s a process that we are really finally getting started in earnest, as well. So we will start with a better schedule and we will have more tools out there. Now when things do go wrong with either mishandled baggage or passengers mis-connected or disrupted because of weather or whatever, we don’t have the tools today. But fortunately we’ve invested in automation that will help us, again, reunite customers with baggage and then also getting customers back on the way. So on those fronts today we don’t have a dynamic re- accommodation tool for our customers where they can go directly to the web or mobile to be able to get on new itinerary. That’s something that we will be incrementally rolling out over the next year and a half. There are new notification tools for customers in order to let them know what’s going on with their trip and with bags that we will be rolling out over the course of the next 12 months, which is fantastic. And so whether it’s baggage, whether it’s on- time performance, whether it’s the whole overall experience we are going to be doing a better job and, again, I think most of these things are upside for us that some others in the industry already have in position. David Koenig Okay. Thanks. Doug Parker Thanks. David. I don’t think we’ve ever done this before, but we are running out of time. One of the things we like to do at American, at certainly the new American is same day we announce earnings we go have a big system-wide call with the all of our employees that have been calling in here but what is going on the state of the airline with live downstairs with people that are here, but also for people listening in. And that is due to start in 10 minutes. We need to get downstairs. So apologies if we are cutting anyone off. I think we have time for two more. So operator, two more please. Operator Thank you. We’ll go next to Alana Wise with Reuters. Alana Wise Hi, good morning, thanks so much for taking our questions. I wanted to ask quickly about American’s interest in possibly reworking the joint venture with Qantas now that Trump is in office. They told us yesterday that you currently reviewing the process of refiling the paperwork and that they have been reviewing the implications on how to cooperate on routes. So I’m just curious if this is something that American is currently looking into? Steve Johnson Hi, this is Steve. One of the reporters asked that question a couple of minutes ago, and we answered it more fully. But I will just say in the interest of time, yes, we do plan… Alana Wise Apologizes. Steve Johnson No problem at all. We do plan to refile the application with Qantas. It probably is a few weeks down the road just for the reason that I mentioned before is that the new administration isn’t in place yet, but we are looking forward to doing that and having another opportunity to make our case. Alana Wise And as a quick follow-up, I’m curious about Trump yesterday, the administration the other day saying that they are going to implement a border tax and what American thoughts on that are? Steve Johnson Well, I never like to talk about politics or religion on earnings call. So I’m going to pass. Doug Parker Thank you. Alana Wise Thank you. Operator Our final question will come from Edward Russell with Flightglobal. Edward Russell Hi, thank you for taking my question today. What is the status of the JV with LatAm? I know that’s been pending for a while now. Steve Johnson We filed that application… Doug Parker This is Steve again. Steve Johnson Yes, Steve Johnson, again. We filed that application sometime early in 2016. We also filed similar applications in the other countries that are relevant to the JV, most especially Chile and Brazil. The United States application is not going to be acted upon by the DOT until the Congress in Brazil ratifies the Open Skies treaty with the United States. We don’t know when that is going to occur, but you won’t see much action at the DOT until then. And then we’d expect it’s a complicated process and a pretty significant joint venture. So I would expect it would be another nine to 12 months at least after that happens before we have an answer for you. Edward Russell Understood. Great, thank you so much. Doug Parker Great. Thanks. Thanks everybody. Apologies if we didn’t get to your questions. Obviously, onto corporate communications and they will be happy to get you responses or if it’s investor questions call into Dan Cravens, Investor Relations. Thank you all very, very much for your interest. These are exciting times for us at American. We appreciate your interest in all that we have going on. Talk you soon. Thanks, bye.

Operator Good morning and welcome to the American Airlines Group First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Today's conference call is being recorded. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operation Instructions] And now, we would like to turn the conference over to your moderator, Managing Director of Investor Relations, Mr. Dan Cravens. Please go ahead, sir. Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us on the call this morning is Doug Parker, our Chairman and CEO; Robert Isom, President; and Derek Kerr, Chief Financial Officer. Also in the room with us for the Q&A session is Elise Eberwein, our EVP of People and Communications; Bev Goulet, our Chief Integration Officer; Maya Leibman, Chief Information Officer; Steve Johnson, our EVP of Corporate Affairs; and Don Casey, our Senior VP of Revenue Management. Like we normally do, we're going to start the call with Doug and he will provide us an overview of our first quarter 2017 results. Derek will then walk us through the details on the quarter and provide some additional information on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Robert will then follow with commentary on the operational performance and revenue environment and then after we hear from those comments, we'll open the call for analyst questions and, lastly, questions from the media. But before we begin, we must state that today's call does contain forward-looking statements, including statements concerning revenue, our future revenues and costs, forecast of capacity, traffic, load factor, fleet plans and fuel prices. These statements represent our predictions and expectations as to future events but numerous risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ from those projected. Information about some of these risks and uncertainties can be found in our earnings press release issued this morning in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. In addition, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures this morning such as net profit and CASM excluding unusual items. A reconciliation of those numbers to the GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release and that can be found on our website at aa.com. A webcast of this call will be archived on our website. The information that we're giving you on the call is as of today's date and we undertake no obligation to update the information subsequently. So thanks again for joining us, and at this point, we'll turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Doug Parker. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks a lot, Dan. Thanks, everybody, for being on the call. This morning, we reported our pre-tax earnings excluding special items of $491 million. We are extremely excited about the near and long-term prospects for American Airlines and our shareholders. We are in the midst of transforming American through investments in our product and our team and it is working. Our unit revenues are increasing at a faster rate than our competition and the outlook is strong. Robert will talk more about that in a minute. Before that, I just want to talk a little bit about an initiative we put in place last night. Many of you have heard us talk about the mission at American, which is to validate the trust that is placed in us. That is a trust our customers place in us and when they choose American for their travel, and it's a trust all of you put in us when you select American as an investment choice. And at American, building trust for us starts first with our own team. We announced yesterday something that impacts our expenses, but it's also a very important step as we rebuild trust at American with our team. The announcement yesterday was that we would make mid-contract pay increases for our pilot and flight attendant groups. It's an unprecedented move because those two groups have close to two years left on their existing contracts and to the best of our knowledge, something like this has never been done in our industry. And so therefore, it's a move that might surprise or even dismay some of you because it adds costs to the airline. We couldn't be more convicted about doing it and here's why. When we merged, we knew we were creating not only the largest airline in the world, but we set out to build the best. And that's best defined by a global network, a best-in-class product and an engaged and enthusiastic team. With our industry profoundly changed, we made a commitment when we merged, the new American would have pay rates for our team that were at or near the top of our competitor's pay rates. And I'm happy to report that we've lived up to that commitment in every joint contract we negotiated thus far. Also, the reason last fall, in spite of not having reached an agreement for our mechanics and fleet service workers, we moved their pay rates to industry leading rates in an unprecedented move as those contract negotiations have continued. But it's the right move for the new American. So we're going to keep leading this way because it's the right way to lead any service organization and certainly the right way to lead American Airlines. There's a history at American that's bred some mistrust, and we're working hard to change that culture, and the team is making great progress in that regard. We recognize pay alone won't build trust, but we also know it's an important step in the right direction. As outlined in our 8-K last night, the expense add is about $350 million annually for something less than two years – I'm sorry, less than – a little over two years, as our contracts were amendable at the end of 2019 and early 2020. That's certainly a lot of money of our shareholders but in the bigger picture and taking the longer view, as a service organization, investments in our team are investments in our product. And the leverage at American today is in closing our unit revenue gap, and we believe this is an investment that will help us do that and therefore help our shareholders. We think it's precisely this kind of investment in our people is going to make the difference in our service, and while this won't happen overnight, we also think it's the kind of investment that will continue to drive revenue outperformance for American. And as that happens, all of you will be the beneficiaries of those returns. So in closing, we're tightening the revenue gap quickly, and our investments to accomplish this are going to continue. Because we work for all of you, you can be assured we're using your money to create an airline for the long-term. We couldn't be more excited about our prospects. And now, I'll turn it to Derek for the financials and then Robert will talk more specifically about how we're doing in the operation and in our revenue progress. Derek? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Doug, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our 120,000 team members who continue to do an exceptional job of taking care of our customers. Because of their hard work, our integration efforts and financial performance have been outstanding. As Doug mentioned, we filed our earnings press release this morning. In that release, our first quarter 2017 GAAP net profit was $234 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. This compares to our first quarter 2016 GAAP net profit of $700 million or $1.14 per diluted share. Excluding special items, we reported a net profit of $308 million in the first quarter 2017, or $0.61 per share versus first quarter 2016 net profit of $765 million or $1.25 per diluted share. The significant year-over-year decline in earnings is due primarily to a 37.8% or $472 million increase in first quarter 2017 consolidated fuel expense. Our GAAP first quarter 2017 pre-tax profit was $365 million. Excluding net special items, our first quarter pre-tax profit was $491 million, resulting in a pre-tax margin of 5.1%. Our revenue performance continued to improve in the first quarter 2017 as total operating revenues were up 2% year-over-year to $9.6 billion. Passenger revenues were $8.2 billion, up 0.8% on a yield improvement of 2.4%. This marks the third consecutive quarter that our unit revenue performance has been the best of the six largest U.S. carriers. Robert will give more detail on our revenue performance later on the call after I'm done. Cargo revenues were up 6.3% to $172 million due primarily to higher volume. Other operating revenues were $1.3 billion, up 9.3% versus the same period last year due primarily to revenue associated with our new credit – co-branded credit card agreements. Total GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $9 billion, up 11.4% versus the same period last year due primarily to higher fuel prices and salaries and benefit expense resulting from the investment in our team. Had our first quarter 2017 fuel prices been flat to last year's $1.21 per gallon, our consolidated fuel expense would have been approximately $500 million lower. First quarter CASM was $0.1402, up 12.6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel and special items, our consolidated CASM was $0.1116, or up 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to salaries and benefits, increases provided to our team members, which is about worth three points, higher depreciation and amortization resulting from increased CapEx in our aircraft – new aircraft, about a point, and maintenance timing of about a point. We ended the quarter with approximately $9.1 billion in total available liquidity, comprised of cash and investments of $6.7 billion and $2.4 billion of an undrawn revolver capacity. The company also has restricted cash position of $543 million. During the quarter, our treasury team raised $983 million to finance 24 aircraft deliveries at a fixed rate blended cost of 3.93%. We also re-priced $1.8 billion term loan at an industry leading rate of LIBOR plus 200 [bps]. In addition, we also closed two private mortgage transactions to finance four more aircraft. In the first quarter of 2017, the company returned $563 million to its shareholders, including quarterly dividend payments totaling $51 million and the repurchase of $512 million of common stock or 11.7 million shares. Including share repurchases, shares withheld to cover taxes associated with employee share distributions and equity awards and the cash extinguishment of convertible debt, our share count has dropped by over a third from 500 – excuse me, 756.1 million at merger close in December 2013 to 495.7 million shares as of March 31. The company did declare a dividend of $0.10 per share to be paid on May 30, 2017, to stockholders of record as of May 16, 2017. In April, we also made a $279 million contribution to the company's defined benefit plans, of which only $25 million was required, which are now fully – the plans are now fully funded as of April 17, 2017 under the Airline Relief Act. In addition to our earnings release, we also filed our investor update this morning. Consistent with our previous guidance in the second quarter of 2017, we expect our system-wide ASM growth to be up approximately 1.5%. For the full year, we expect consolidated system capacity to be up approximately 1.5% and domestic consolidated capacity to be up approximately flat year-over-year. We expect international capacity to be up approximately 4%, primarily due to the continuing impact of the 777-200 retrofit program and the year-over-year impact of new Pacific markets that we added in 2016. Over the past two years, we have made significant investment in our people, our product and our operation. And as Doug discussed in his remark, we are offering mid-year contract, hourly base pay rate adjustments of approximately 5% to our flight attendants and an average of 8% to our pilots. The estimated pre-tax income on the company's 2017 salary and benefits expense would be approximately $230 million in 2017 and $350 million in 2018 and 2019. So those are numbers that come off the base that we are at today. So the total impact is $350 million. We are happy to be able to fulfill the commitment we made to our team members and continue to believe these investments are vital to improving our product and operation. With these pay rate adjustments, we now expect our second quarter of 2017 year-over-year consolidated CASM, excluding special items to be up approximately 7%. The mainline is in the range of 6% to 8%, and the regional is in the 3% to 5% range. We continue to expect higher year-over-year fuel prices in 2017, based on the forward curve as of April 24. We expect to pay between $1.63 and $1.68 per gallon consolidated in the second quarter of 2017, which is approximately 16% higher year-over-year. Using the midpoints of the guidance we just provided along with Robert's revenue guidance, we expect our second quarter 2017 pre-tax margin, excluding special items, to be between 11% and 13%. For the full year, we expect gross aircraft CapEx to total $4.1 billion. This includes the delivery of 57 mainline aircraft and 16 regional aircraft, while retiring 46 mainline aircraft and reducing the overall regional fleet count by 9 aircraft. In addition, we expect to invest $1.6 billion in non-aircraft CapEx, which includes projects to improve our product and operations, as well as investments to complete our integration. With respect to our fleet, we announced in our release this morning that we reached a new amended agreement with Airbus to defer delivery of the 22 A350 XWB aircraft the company has on order. Under the new amended delivery schedule, we expect to take delivery of the first two A350 aircraft in late 2020 instead of 2018, as previously expected. We now expect to take delivery of these A350s from 2020 through 2024 with an average deferral of 24 months. In addition, we also reached agreement with Boeing to defer the delivery of two 787-9 aircraft from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019. These changes, as well as the impact of changes to net pre-delivery payments, reduced the company's planned capital expenditures by approximately $500 million in 2018 and approximately $300 million in 2019 and 2020 and provides us with additional wide body capacity flexibility. So in conclusion, our team produced outstanding results in the first quarter and we look forward to more of the same as we move into the peak summer travel period. I would like to, again, thank our 120,000 team members for the great service they provide to our customers. With that, I will turn it over to Robert. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Derek. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us. I would like to start by recognizing our 120,000 employees. My colleagues have done outstanding work over the quarter and we've asked a lot of them over the last few years and they've really delivered. The first three months of the year, we saw continued improvement across the enterprise, including operational improvements, fleet refresh, customer experience and team member engagement. We continue to make smart long-term investments in things like customer service training, facilities improvements for both our employees and customers and technology to improve the overall customer experience. These investments are starting to pay real dividends, and we're really excited about the trajectory that we're on. Our operation continued to take big steps for the first quarter. Despite the impact of Winter Storm Stella in March, which disrupted the operations at stations in the Southeast, Mideast and Northeast, American team members set new post-merger operational records in February for mainline, on-time departures, on-time arrivals and mishandled baggage. We had eight days without a single mainline cancellation in the first quarter, which is more than any year that we've had since the merger. These accomplishments demonstrate our progress in creating a consistently reliable operation for our customers and team members. While much of the integration work is already complete, there's several noteworthy projects in the works that will refine our network and make us even stronger for our customers. Some of these projects include the March announcement of new service to eight cities from our hub in Chicago, as well as one new route in Dallas-Fort Worth and Miami. None of these 10 new additions will serve cities that have flights to other American hubs and have historically performed well. In addition, the bank patterns at our Miami hub have been redesigned to facilitate better connections, more efficient gate utilization and faster processing through customs and immigration. One critical part of refining the network is focusing on the areas where we can maximize the value of our resources and we're building up service in profitable cities, improving the efficiency of the scheduling process and making structural changes at our hubs. These are just a few of the examples of how we're striving to invest our resources to create a seamless operation for our team members, the best product for our customers and the highest return for our owners. On the commercial side, we rolled out the new Basic Economy product in 10 test markets in early March with encouraging results. In the 10 launch market, half of the eligible Basic Economy passengers have bought up to the main cabin, which is right in line with our forecast. We plan to continue to roll the product out to the remainder of our domestic and short haul international markets in a phased approach with more markets coming in May and June. At the end of March, we started selling Premium Economy with our first departures on May 4. We expect to have nine widebody aircraft configured with Premium Economy by the second quarter and more as time comes in the future. We also announced an agreement to invest $200 million in China's largest carrier, China Southern Airlines. Later this year, we expect to begin codeshare and interline agreements that will give our customers approximately 70 more destinations in China, beyond Beijing and Shanghai. Lastly, we entered into an arrangement with Scandinavian Airlines to obtain two slot pairs at London's Heathrow Airport, strengthening American's presence at a key international gateway for American and our joint business partner, British Airways. Turning to revenue, we're very pleased with the revenue performance in the first quarter. Our first quarter consolidated PRASM was up 2%, and our first quarter TRASM was up 3.1%. This is the third consecutive quarter where our unit revenue performance was materially better than the rest of the industry. And not just the industry average, but better than each of the six largest U.S. carriers. We believe that this outperformance can be attributed to the significant investments we've made in many years of business from our people to our product and to selling, revenue management, our AAdvantage program and our mobile platform and aa.com. And customers are noticing. We recorded our highest customer satisfaction rating since the merger, the fifth consecutive month of sequential improvement. And last week, the Harris Poll named American Airlines its Full Service Airline Brand of the Year. And earlier this year, American was named the 2017 Airline of the Year by Air Transport World. Turning to domestic, our consolidated PRASM was up 2.3% and importantly, improved in every month in the quarter. We have been implementing a number of revenue management initiatives for the Premium cabin and they have proven very successful. Our sales initiatives are also bearing fruit. We continue to see a positive trend in corporate share in the first quarter with strong results across the network. This trend is continuing as we enter the second quarter as well. Our Latin America performance overall was very strong, with PRASM up 7.7%. Although Brazil led the way, up 43%, strength (20:14) broad-based also. The balance of South America had positive unit revenue growth as well, while other areas within the region had low single digit declines. The Atlantic was our weakest performing international entity with PRASM down 5.9%, but that number overstates the decline in actual performance. It requires some explanation. While our results did decline as a result of industry growth in a soft pricing environment, half of the decline that we saw is due to an out of period adjustment that positively impacted last year's results. And another point and a half is due to the decline in UK currency and our exposure to that. Across the Pacific, PRASM was positive. This is the first positive result since the third quarter of 2014 and is a sign that we're turning the corner around our capacity build-out in the Pacific. We expect this region to continue to improve as we lap the additions of Haneda, Sydney, Auckland and Hong Kong throughout the year. First quarter cargo revenue improved 6.3% year-over-year on strong growth, a positive trend that we've seen since the latter half of 2016. The focus that our cargo team members have placed on improving cargo's operational performance and efforts to deliver best-in-class customer experience are paying off and being recognized by the industry. American Airlines Cargo was voted Air Cargo News 2017 Cargo Airline of the Year for the third straight year. And American is the only U.S. based carrier to have been recognized with this honor in the award's 34-year history. So looking forward, the revenue environment at American is very strong, and we expect this momentum to continue. The June quarter will mark the sixth quarter in a row of sequential improvement unit revenue and the third consecutive quarter of positive unit revenue growth. Based on published guidance, we expect to outperform the industry in the second quarter as well, for the fourth quarter in a row. We continue to expect positive revenue improvements for each quarter throughout this year. Regionally, our domestic PRASM is expected to strengthen in the quarter due to a number of initiatives focused on Premium cabin pricing and yield management and continuing gains through our investments in our sales organizations. In Latin America, we expect another quarter of strong year-over-year improvements with every entity having positive unit revenue. The Pacific entity is expected to perform in line with the first quarter. Lastly, the Atlantic region has continued to show modest signs of improvement due to easing comps from past terror events. However, it remains challenged, as low priced carriers continue to grow and the British pound remains weak. As we look to the second quarter and beyond, we're excited about our operational commercial investments, and we expect our second quarter total revenue for ASM to be up 3% to 5% year-over-year. We rolled out our new Basic Economy product, our Premium Economy product as well, and early results are encouraging. While we have a lot of work to do, we look forward to reporting on future successes. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to the operator and begin our Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operation Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kevin Crissey with Citi. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello, Kevin. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Can you provide evidence that cultural investments are more than recouped through higher revenue? Having worked at JetBlue, I can assure you that investors are unconvinced by this argument. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Kevin, what I'm certain of is that we – the leverage in this airline is in closing the revenue gap that we have. And I'm equally certain that our ability to do that, while asking our team to work for less than their peers is a big challenge and one that I'm certain either is fair to our team nor to our leadership because it makes it increasingly difficult. So I don't know that I can directly answer your question but I'm highly confident that it is correlated. And would note, again, this isn't about us making a bet that, oh, if we can go get to rates that are – pay levels that are higher than others, that will get us something that will allow us to generate higher revenues than others. I don't think I would make that argument. This is about us getting our team to the levels that are currently in place at our competitor airlines and consistent with the commitment we made to our team at the time of the merger that we would compensate them in line with their peers at other airlines, a commitment again that we've made consistently with each and every contract. But in the case of these two contracts that were done shortly after the merger and were put in place on five-year terms, which is also worth noting, longer terms than the other airlines are putting in place today. It just got to where the gap was too big and it was going to be in place for too long and that didn't feel right to any of us. So I feel good about that commitment. It's a commitment we're happy to make, not just in this case, but to any of the rest of our team to the extent we see large discrepancies in our pay rates, our base pay rates versus competitors, other airlines and there's still significant amount of time and we can get that addressed through contract negotiations. You should expect us to correct it because that's the right thing to do for our team and I think – and I do believe, Kevin, what happens so long as we do that, we have an engaged and excited team that is seeing the trust they placed in us validated and they go take care of our customers and that's the best way to take care of our shareholder. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. But isn't this taking your number one cost item and handing it over to the most aggressive competitor effectively? Whoever thinks that they can pay the most goes out and signs a contract and your labor rates are going to go to that optimistic or arguably the dumbest management team out there is an argument investors could look at. You've taken it out of your hands and put it in the hands of others and that doesn't feel like what well run companies do. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I would beg to differ. Again, given the experience levels here, and what our teams have been through. And look, we're comfortable with the commitment. You're right, in one sense, I suppose, that if you want to look at our commitment and figure out what it means for the industry, the answer is you've got to go ask others in the industry because we're, indeed, not leading this charge. We're just making sure we're staying – we're catching up. So where it goes in the future will be dependent on what others do in the future. But look, I feel, I think again, I think this is – what you're seeing here is the maturing of an industry and an industry that has seen the people work in this business go through incredibly difficult times and what we needed to have happen was that get corrected. And I think look – and I think it's largely corrected. We were encouraged to hear Delta, apparently at their Investor Day, mentioned that they put in place a 6% pay increase for all their team, for all their non-union members, which at Delta is everyone, I believe, except their pilots and their dispatchers. So the vast majority of the airline they increased 6% again this year but note on their Investor Day they thought that was their last industry reset and they would see inflationary increases in the future. So I don't know that I agree with your premise but I certainly agree with our commitment and that is we're going to make sure, because it's important that our team who is an incredibly important part of our product is excited and engaged. And it's hard to do that if they see others that do the same job they do and don't do it as well at other companies, getting compensated more on an hourly basis. So that's important to us. It will continue to be important. I don't think it's dramatically different than if you saw another airline make some major enhancement to their in-flight product, you would see us match those because it is an important part of making sure that we're taking care of our customers. And these are the people to take care of our customers, the people that are on the frontline, not just our pilots and flight attendants, our mechanics, our fleet service employees, our reservations agents, our gate agents, every single one of them deserves the same commitment and we're happy to make it. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Operator Moving next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, you have this plan to achieve pre-tax profits mid-cycle of $5 billion. Over the last year or so, it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat. Consensus estimates certainly don't embrace that outcome and now, of course, you're adding additional costs to your internal forecast. When do you think you'll be able to reverse direction and start moving towards that objective? Or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah, Jamie, I think you referenced some comments that we made at your conference and the rest of the group may not know what you're talking about, so let me try. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Oh, I'm sorry. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. That's quite all right. And I don't know, your conference is so well attended maybe everybody knows exactly what you're talking about but I'll try anyway. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC When it doesn't snow. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, that did make it rough. So look, and importantly, I need to restate it because – I would restate it slightly differently than what you just said. Here's what I said and here's what we do. And it's a really important point so I'm glad you raised it. We believe the – we have a company today that over – on average, over time in today's current environment, should generate pre-tax earnings of around $5 billion. Now, look, it's a volatile business. We all know that. That hasn't changed. While that level of earnings is a number that no one has ever fathomed before, the fact is it's still volatile. So, we think it will average $5 billion over time. We think the better years will look around like $7 billion and the lesser years will look around like $3 billion but over time, we should expect this company can generate over time $5 billion. Now, look, that is not just a statement that we make. That is how we compensate our every one of the employees at American Airlines that get an annual bonus, so everyone essentially manager level and above. That's why this is important. We use that formula I just said to fund our annual incentive pool, and we've done that since the merger. Now again, the $3 billion and $7 billion have moved around a little bit as we've gotten more comfortable with post-merger earnings, but the $5 billion hasn't changed since the day of the merger. And maybe it will change one day but we're not changing it – we're certainly – nothing about what we're seeing today leads us to believe that should change. So that's what I reported to you all is that – that's what we think about the earnings prospects of this company. And not only do we think that, that's how we fund our incentive pool. So, again, the way the incentive pool works, not that you care that much about our executive compensation, but I think it's really important to what you think about our expectations for the business. We fund the incentive pool by telling the team, look, if we have a year where we make $5 billion, we're going to fund the incentive pool at target. If we have a year where we make $3 billion, we're going to fund it at half of target, below that, there's no bonus. And if we have a year where we make $7 billion that's the maximum, which is double the bonus. So – and you're right, no one on the Street, I think, is forecasting $5 billion for American this year. But we didn't change that formula for the team. So this – if indeed the Street is right, this will be one of those years that's slightly worse. And there will be years in the future that are slightly better. What's important about this point is that if we are right, and, again, we're not just throwing out numbers here. This is how we're incentivizing our management team. If we're right, our stock is so undervalued it defies logic in my view. If we're right, and this company is going to – over time going to average $5 billion pre-tax, really easy – really simple math and you guys are a lot better at this than me, but I'll go to the simple math, $5 billion taxed is $3 billion, $3 billion and for a company today that is trading at somewhere around – has a market cap of about $24 billion, that's eight times what I'm telling you I think is our steady state earnings. Eight times steady state earnings when the average S&P company over the last 20-something years has had a multiple of earnings of something like, help me, Dan, 19 times. Feels like people don't believe the $5 million (sic) [$5 billion] (34:05) number. And that's fine. But we do. So that's why we're so bullish on the company. And the investments we've made today only strengthen that view. We don't look at that and think, oh, gosh, now it's $300 million harder to get to $5 billion. We look at this and say this reinforces our view that we're going to continue the momentum we have in improving the revenues by these investments we're making, and we feel even better about that in the long-term. So that's what I said, and that's what we still believe. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC As part of that, it looks like it still takes considerably more American employees to get the job done than at Delta. And it's tough for me to accurately do that analysis. There's some outsourcing issues we have to account for, but there do seem to be opportunities for American to become more efficient, and your letter last night seems to imply as much but maybe that's just my interpretation. Can you quantify the opportunity to improve labor efficiency? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, I would say this. When you say it's difficult for you to do that, I would argue it's almost impossible for you to compare those numbers. There are enormous differences in the amount of work that American does in-house versus what some other airlines do outside. So you wouldn't see it in the head count or in the salaries, you'd see it, instead, in their numbers and their outside services, and we try to do similar analysis and you can't get there, I don't think. But I'll tell you this, as is the case in most mergers, when you're running two airlines, you need to have some redundancies in place that as you get through the merger, you can eliminate, and we still have some of that in place. But rather than trying to quantify it, because I don't know that we know what it is yet and/or how we're going to manage it and over what period of time, I would just point you to the guidance that Derek rattled off on our cost trends. We had CASM ex fuel in the first quarter here of 8%. The second quarter we say 6% to 8%. The third quarter we say 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter we say 2% to 4%. That includes – again, those estimates include this adjustment that we made last night. So that's a rapidly declining year-over-year increase in cost. And while we're in no position to start giving 2018 guidance yet, I would certainly expect that that trend would continue into 2018 and that is that number of 2% to 4%. And fourth quarter 2017 would be even lower for the full year of 2018. So it's coming down. The rate of growth is certainly slowing. But look, we recognize that our job is to make sure we're running the airline efficiently, and we believe we're doing so today. There are some things that because we're still running in some cases two separate airlines that may have us doing that less efficiently than we'll be able to do over time, but we'll make sure we get there as quickly as we possibly can. I think you'll start to see most of that in 2018 and, again, nothing to report now on how big that will be because I don't think we know. I know we don't know because I don't know. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Yeah. Doug, I appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Jamie. Operator We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good morning, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Andrew. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Doug, on that note, in terms of the $5 billion, kind of, run rate pre-tax earnings, I guess, when you consider that, and given the permanent step-up in labor, does it change your view at all of capital allocation? With these higher fixed costs, would you consider more debt pay-down over share repurchases going forward? And if not, why? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. The short answer is no. And again, I come back to the overriding point, which is this increase in our near-term expenses in no way changes our view about our long-term prospects. Indeed, it gives us more confidence that they're achievable. So nothing about this makes us think anything about – and, again, let me make one other point on that because this seems to be a theme – a recurring theme that I'm having trouble getting across. We look at this longer term than – and on the long-term, this was an expense that was coming. There's no way when we got to 2020 and did new contracts, of course, that we're going to go sign new contracts with our team that were going to keep in place this sort of a gap. So we accelerated an expense. Again, not something we do lightly and not something we had to do, something we thought we should do. But none of this, to us, feels like any sort of change in the long-term prospects, and when we think about things like share repurchase and capital allocation, we think about it in the long-term. So no, no change in that. We're really confident with our current capital allocation. We think we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, we're happy yet again, as Derek noted, to make some purchases in the quarter that were a good bit less than the price at least as we opened today, and so we feel good about that. We think we – another thing worth noting again on the capital allocation piece is, yeah, our debt is higher, but it's because our assets are better. Another point that I think sometimes gets lost, maybe our fault for not mentioning it enough, but this higher levels in debt versus our competitors is driven by the fact that we have a much younger fleet, and that fleet is a lot more valuable. There's a fleet they have in place and that drives higher debt, of course. So we feel good about the capital allocation, and we will continue to do what's best for our shareholders and our team as we go forward. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Understood. I guess, maybe kind of changing gears a little bit, maybe one for Robert. Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing on the Trans-Atlantic, given kind of this onslaught of low cost carrier capacity into the summer? Have you adapted the way you manage inventory in response to this at all? And kind of what are your expectations for demand on Trans-Atlantic as we head through the summer? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Don give some more color. But we're optimistic about what we're seeing close in. But as you note, have concerns about capacity in the long run. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes. I mean, we – clearly, there's a lot of capacity growth, and there's a pretty active pricing environment. The industry did a big reset in terms of pricing last year heading into the fourth quarter where we've been more – a bit more aggressive versus low cost carriers. We do have easing comps. So as we go forward, I think we're going to see the comps get a bit easier. We also ran last year at relatively low load factors, U.S. point of sale demand was not as strong as we had hoped last year. Although we're seeing some weakness coming out of the UK, overall, the U.S. point of sale seems very robust this year, and we expect, as we go through the summer that we're going to run materially higher load factors than last year. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Hunter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Yes. Good morning. So I know, maybe it's a question for Derek, since Derek is the one that made this comment last quarter. I know you said, obviously, it's early to guide to 2018 CASM, but just last quarter you said you think you'd be able to keep CASM ex under 2% over the next couple of years. I'm not sure if you were referring to an average number, or each of the two years? But given the new labor cost increase, do you still feel like that's doable? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I still feel like that's doable for each of the two years, not just over the two years but for each of the two years. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC All right. Good. And then just to be totally clear, I think, Robert, you said you expect continuing positive improvements in RASM each quarter this year. You weren't saying the 3Q growth rate was going to get better than 2Q or just saying it's going to be above zero, right? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Do you want to give us maybe an early quick read on how you're thinking about 3Q, anything we should know about in terms of like calendar weirdness, or capacity or anything you're lapping, just to kind of give us an early thought, how to think about that sort of second derivative growth rate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, there's really – there was a lot of pricing action in the domestic market last year that kind of got sorted out in July that had an impact on some of the bookings through August in particular. October actually was a bit of a weak month for just about everybody last year. But other than that, I think it's nothing stands out as being dramatically impacting the last half of 2017. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Hunter. Operator We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Hey. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hi. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Just on the combination of CapEx and pension funding, can you walk us through that this year, 2018 and 2019? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. So in this year, we'll have $4.4 billion in combination, so CapEx of $4.1 billion. Pensions, we did $279 million. In 2018, CapEx – aircraft CapEx is $1.6 billion, and pension right now we're forecasting $1.1 billion. But one thing I want to note on that, that's an assumption that the mortality tables do change. If the mortality tables do not change, that'll be reduced by about $400 million, so we have the most conservative number in there. So it's $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx and $1.1 billion in pension payments. And then in 2019, aircraft CapEx is $2.8 billion and pension payment is right at a $1 billion. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI And is that $1 billion level – for a longer-term model, is that $1 billion level kind of what we should be thinking about? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, it drops in – in 2020 it drops to $600 million; and 2021, it drops to $600 million. And those are all assuming the mortality table changes. If those don't change, then those could be modified, but it goes down to $600 million in 2020 and 2021, so I'd say the run rate is more $600 million past to the 2019 timeframe. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. And we should add $1.5 billion in non-aircraft to those numbers? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. At least through 2020 and then I think it'll come down to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks for that detail. Have you looked at – I know at least one competitor was able to go into the unsecured market and get very attractive rates to sort of advance fund some of that. Have you analyzed that? Is that something you could even do, given the higher leverage? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. We have analyzed it. We could do it if we want. We think we're – we don't have any requirement to do any payment until 2018 and don't believe we should go forward with that. I think the $1.1 billion we're doing in 2018 will get us to 80% funded which is exactly where one of my competitors went to. So that's the reason we're going to 2018. We only have to do, I think it's $60 million in 2018, so the $1.1 billion is significantly over what we're required to do in order for us to get to that 80% funded once the Airline Relief Act comes off. So, well, it's similar to what they're doing, we just don't need to do it until 2018. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks very much. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Duane. Operator We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good morning. Thanks for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Robert and Don, this'll probably be for you. You – your updated RASM guide points to sequential improvement that's relatively modest versus peers and relative to just what you posted in 1Q, and you've highlighted a lot of revenue opportunities that are impressive out there. What do you think is the driver there in terms of the lack of an acceleration, given all the things that you've got going on? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'm not so sure I'd characterize it like that because in all honesty, what we're seeing is a lot of demand for our Premium cabin, and that I think is a sign that the kind of investments that we're making are taking root. We see that strength holding strong forward in the business market and from a business perspective as well. And I think that our outperformance is going to continue. It – we've got a good impressive string here, and that's what we see going forward. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Go ahead, Don. I'm sorry. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I – first of all, let's not, I guess, confuse guidance with performance. Guidance is guidance and not everybody hits their guidance. So we'll see how the actuals come in when we get through the second quarter. Although on the – from a guidance perspective, this looks like a – sequentially we're not increasing as much. But this will again be the fourth quarter in a row where our performance is better than everybody else's, and so we'll just have to wait and see where the actuals come in, in terms of year-over-year versus others. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Thanks, Don. That's what I was going to say. And again, the others may meet their guidance and we may exceed our guidance. If you're asking us to forecast the gap versus the others, we're certainly not forecasting that that gap will narrow in the second quarter. We just think we probably have – we may have different biases in our forecasting. Ours might be more conservative than theirs. But if the second quarter actuals come in and that gap closes, that's, I don't know, we'll look at why that happened if that happens, but we certainly don't expect that. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Point taken. And the other question, a bit more nuanced, can you talk about the outlook for the LatAm market? Robert, I think you provided some color for 2Q but I was looking for more, just beyond, as far as puts and takes in regard to supply demand, what South America is looking like, Mexico, Caribbean, et cetera. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Okay. This is Don. We had, obviously, a very solid first quarter performance in Latin America, Brazil led the way. We had positive unit revenue in all of South America and low single digit declines in the rest of the South America market. As we look forward into the second quarter, we see continuing strength, actually strength improving. And in the second quarter, we expect a positive year-over-year unit revenue in every entity in Latin America that it looks very, very robust at this point. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And just broader puts and takes as we look beyond 2Q as far as what you're seeing or thinking on the supply side? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We're not really seeing anything dramatic on the supply side in LatAm, overall. We're seeing affirmative growth in Mexico but we're seeing a lot of demand growth as well, but nothing that we see that's going to change our current outlook. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Hey, Doug, you've alluded a couple of times to this opportunity to go drive some relative revenue improvement relative to your peers over the next few years. I mean, I guess, I was just hoping that you'd help characterize where do you think the relative revenue discount is coming from today? I mean, is it network or is it on-time performance? And can you help us understand, sort of, what are the components of that you think are addressable versus those that perhaps aren't as addressable? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Robert try and do that probably more in terms of the things we think we can do to close as opposed to what drivers are. Go ahead, Robert. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Darryl, I'd just like to point out that I think there are a number of things that are benefiting us that are certainly due to the investments we've been making, but in all honesty a lot of catch-up and I do think is – will benefit us and it's going to be unique to American. Some of the things that are just taking root now, as we've talked about, we are still confident that between our Basic and Premium Economy products that we're talking about a $1 billion worth of incremental revenue, which is sizable. I think everybody – I think you know that we haven't really had a premium product for our widebody long haul flying that's been consistent out in the marketplace. And so, this year we will finally have a lie-flat product across all international entities, which is fantastic. We think that we have some density issues with our narrow body fleet that we will be addressing in the coming years as well that I think will have benefits in terms of overall revenue production and also will help us from a unit cost perspective as well. Don and team have been making improvements in revenue management. And I want to underscore the work that we're doing with our sales team as well. And I'd like to say that a lot of that's baked into the current numbers, but I'm glad that as we look forward that that is just coming on, and we think is going to continue to drive outperformance versus the industry. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. So you think all that stuff, and I realize that it is difficult to see this, but if you were to take all of that stuff you that just mentioned there, which seem relatively addressable in nature and add them all up that that's enough to offset both the discount, for instance, from Delta that you're achieving today as well as what I'd call probably a positive or relatively positive impact from you already having to do a fleet in the industry. Is that a fair characterization or is there something structural about the network that's also causing you some difficulty? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. When we take a look at the list of initiatives that we are pursuing, we think that that will definitely make us competitive. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks very much, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Darryl. Operator And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you very much. So, Doug, back in 2007 when you were running Airways, you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth. We've spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a 15 times EBITDA multiple on it. That puts the valuation somewhere around $30 billion to $40 billion. Your market cap is half that. So two questions, would that surprise you, that valuation, and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then, why doesn't it make sense to do the same thing now? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, first off, I can't believe I said that in 2007, but if you say I did, okay. This has been an issue, at least from our perspective is it's part and parcel of the airline and part of running the airline and part of inventory management and something that at least in my recollection I've never considered as a particularly good idea to spend out – maybe when we forgot exactly how we financed survival it might have been something we were looking at. But so, anyway, rather than trying to figure out why I said something in 2007, I'll tell you what we think now, which is. Yes. Well, first up to your larger question, would it surprise me to learn that's the value of the advantage program? I would have to say, yes. Because that is greater than the value of American Airlines in total as we sit here today. But I am not arguing with you. You guys are better at doing valuations than we are, and the market will decide. I find it odd that simply separating something that is inside the airline today and putting it into a separate entity with the exact same cash flows would somehow generate that much incremental value, but again, that's something that you guys can figure out better than we can. But actually, I should be careful on that. If we believe that, then of course we would be spending perhaps more effort trying to figure out how to spend it out. What I believe is the advantage program is really valuable. It's an incredible part of our airline. It's a significant reason that we feel so good about our future. And we maximize the value for our shareholders. And whether or not that is done in-house or in a separate entity, that's going to be the case. And the value will be created. So we agree with you, there's a lot of value there. We agree with you that perhaps that's another reason the airline is undervalued, I just think we're undervalued for all sorts of reasons. I think people don't appreciate what's happened in this industry or this airline, and how it's going to make a difference in the long term. And that's where we're focused. As I told you last time, we agree with your pointing this out, and we will continue to try to do a better job of pointing out to investors as best we can the value of the advantage program. But it's part and parcel of the airline and a really important part of the airline and one that we're happy with the way it's being managed and the value it's producing. And it's in our – in the results of the airline today and in the future. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. I mean I guess, Doug, I would just say that the past two years at Jamie's conference, you've made your – making the lead presentation and talked about why there's less cyclicality in the business and the credit card and loyalty program isn't a part of that. So I'm just wondering, do you not mention it because you don't believe that it's an important part of improving cyclicality? Or are you just hesitant to talk about it because it seems like the first rule of having an airline cobrand card is you don't talk about the airline cobrand card? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. Fair enough. It's not that. So, yes, okay, fair enough. We should probably spend a little more time pointing out that that stream of our earnings is a little less volatile than other streams. So noted. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thanks, Doug. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator Moving on to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about your domestic route network. I know you're focused on Los Angeles, and maybe you can give us a update on facilities and what you're doing there in terms of have the new facilities opening and so on. And then when I think about the growth that's occurring in Fort Lauderdale and the other side of the country, you guys have the big hub in Miami, I get it, in Latin America and so on. But do you worry about the huge increase in capacity an hour and a half north of one of your major, most important hubs and just wondering if you can comment on kind of those two issues? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Steve Johnson will take the LA piece. Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc. Sure. Thanks, Helane. Just with respect to facilities in Los Angeles, we – I think everybody knows that earlier this year or late last year, we actually opened the connector between the Bradley Terminal and Terminal 4, which is in use. I got to use it personally just the other day. It's a great way to get from international connection to our domestic service or vice versa. And that's been a big hit with our customers. Then, very recently, we moved our limited operation that was in Terminal 6 to Terminal 5 and to adjacent to the tunnel that goes between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. So those gates are now much more adjacent and much more convenient for our customers to use. And then finally, we're in negotiations with LAWA for a long-term lease at LAX that will change the face of our facilities there. Those negotiations are confidential beyond that, so I won't say anymore, but we're hopeful that we can get those completed in the next four or five weeks. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. And, Helane, I'll talk a little bit more about South Florida. So, we understand the competition and then also the nature of the markets, and so there's always appropriate consideration. But look, Fort Lauderdale, it's a nice, local market operation. We view Miami differently. We do view it as the ideal connecting opportunity and hub for American, but not just American, of any carrier to the South America. We've got a nice position there. And a lot of the work that we're doing is really to try to maximize the flows and over the long run, we do think that that is something that is going to set us apart. And you may have noticed recently that's actually helped us in markets like Cuba, where we can do things because of the connecting power of the hub, and we're going to continue to make sure that we maximize utility of that operation. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Helane. Operator Moving next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Michael. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Just two quick ones here. Bob, you talked about positive improvement in corporate share when you were talking about domestic PRASM. Any particular sectors or regions where you saw some share gains that you can elaborate on? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. It's Don. I mean, to be honest with you... Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, Don. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We saw improvement across the board for our – in corporate markets. And this, again, marks a kind of high-water mark for us since the merger. And in the first quarter, we had our best performance in terms of both share and share gap, and our trends heading into second quarter are also very strong. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, great. And then just second, just a clarification on the CapEx deferral to Derek. Is that – so is that $800 million or $1.1 billion? I'm not sure if it's $300 million in two years or $300 million per year? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. $300 million per year. So it's $1.1 billion over the three years. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thanks. Operator Savi Syth with Raymond James has our next question. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Good morning. A question on the – in the last few years, I think American has been a little bit more exposed to some areas that have seen greater pressure, be it South America, be it some of the aggressive pricing on low-cost carrier markets, and we are seeing that reverse. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how much more we could see, or how much more there is to go? And maybe some that might not come back in the near-term? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. I mean, basically clearly we had some kind of unique headwinds that affected us, right? The Southwest growth at Love Field, the OCC growth Brazil, Venezuela. But we really kind of came out from under all that at the end of the second quarter of last year. And so, Brazil's clearly one area where we're seeing some year-over-year improvement, but the rest of that really doesn't really drive any year-over-year change. So the real value we're seeing and the uptick in our revenue performance, although Brazil is a piece of that, it's really being driven by all of the other initiatives we have out there in the marketplace. It's the new airplanes, it's the new product, it's the restructuring of our Advantage program, it's the investment we're making in sales, and the investment and change we're making in revenue management. All the things we're doing, which is a long list, right, is really what's driving the benefit. It's not just some lucky, fortunate year-over-year comparison. It's really kind of fundamental, the fundamentals that are getting better for us. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Sorry. And I meant, not necessarily a comparison issue but maybe a reversal issue of some of the pressures that you saw. Finally a follow-up on Mike's question on corporate, was – are we seeing corporate revenue and yields up now year-over-year? Is that firmly in that trend? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Actually in the fourth quarter we did see yields come up. In the first quarter of this year, we saw yields actually for corporate flattish. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks very much. Operator Moving on to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just kind of going back to comments earlier around the revenue initiatives, specifically some initiatives around improving the density on the narrow body fleet. Can you just expand on that for a moment in terms of when you think that could begin to impact results and sort of the opportunity there? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So those are things that we look at on an ongoing basis. And again, some of the things that you will see showing up is the work that we've done with our wide body, our 777 reconfiguration program where we're moving to a standard configuration. So that's on that front. And we think that there's opportunities with the narrow bodies as well. And that is something that you'll see in 2018 and beyond. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. And then just kind of following up on that as well. Thinking about your prepared comments on Basic and Premium Economy, just sort of curious if you could update us in terms of how you're thinking about the portion of your domestic flights that will have those two additional classes of service on them by year-end. And then, just what sort of revenue impact that's expected to have in the back half of the year as comps perhaps get a little bit more challenging? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So in terms of Basic, that's something that we anticipate for – it will be something that we offer throughout our network. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Yes. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So for Basic, it's really just the timing of the rollout for us, right? So, we have more markets coming in May and June. These are still, I guess, I would view as kind of test markets, the next two tranches similar to the first tranche. But we're going to end up expanding this broadly across the whole network eventually, right, and pacing item for that is really going to be our training and staffing. But we're committed to roll this out everywhere, and we're quite encouraged by the initial results. Premium Economy is the next thing. And we don't really kind of get to a critical mass of airplanes on our roll-out of Premium Economy probably until we get in first quarter of next year. So we still kind of consider what we're doing right now kind of a test, and we're very focused on this. A lot of it is channel education. We're the first U.S. airline to have this product, and so we need to make sure that all of our distribution, all of our selling channels know what the product is. And we need to make sure we work with our third-party distributors as well to make sure that the product is being appropriately displayed in all the systems, so people will understand what it is and what they're buying. And that's what we're focused on right now for Premium Economy. But, again, it will be critical mass by the first quarter of next year. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. Thanks again for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator And Brandon Oglenski with Barclays has our next question. Sorry. Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research has our next question. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Doug, help us understand why the $5 billion pre-tax target is realistic from your perspective. You're saying it's the right hurdle for executive compensation, and I know you. You're not pulling that out of thin air. Why is that? So from where you sit, what are the larger revenue opportunities over the cycle that gives you confidence you can offset the labor headwinds this morning, and what are the new initiatives worth over the coming one to two years? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I think Robert laid those out pretty well. He can lay them out again for you, if you'd like, as to what the initiatives are. And as to the value themselves, we mentioned that as well. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Basic and Premium Economy we mentioned. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Right. So look, that is the value that gives us confidence. All you need to do is look at the current gap in revenue per ASM as soon as we close that, you easily get to numbers like $5 billion as a run rate number. So, look, but that's not how we go about coming up with this number. The way we come up with this number is knowing what we do about where the industry is today and where American Airlines is positioned in that industry, both of which we feel good about and both of which feel dramatically different than they've ever been before. And based upon that view, that's what this feel – that's what the company feels like to us. I don't want to portend or pretend that we go and that – those numbers I said to you are the basis of some enormous analysis that's laid out for the next 15 years. It's where we believe this company is today. And look, the facts support it. Since the time of the merger, we have had earnings in that range. This is a worse year than others, and it's still in the range. One of the things I do like to point out to people when they – part of the reason – part of the explanation, at least, I get sometimes, Dan, from investors as to why it is even if you believe what we – why it is that that we are so undervalued relative to other industries. The reason I get is, well, it's because investors are afraid you guys are going to do all the things you've done in the past to eliminate value. And as someone who's been around through all those years, I know what those things are and were, and the things that are rattled off, as you know, you're going to grow faster than – once you start making money, you'll grow faster than demand. Once you start making money, you'll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money, and they'll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders. Fuel prices will go up, and you guys won't be able to react. I would just point out this: In the last three years, all those things have happened. And that is unit revenues of – capacity has grown in excess of demand in the last couple years; and as a result, unit revenues have fallen at rates that we haven't seen in this business since 9/11. Probably more than they've ever fallen over a two-year period at any point in time. So unit revenues have declined because we've added more capacity than there is demand. Employee pay has increased at a rate that no one – that has never been seen before. And so that's happened. Fuel prices, indeed, have increased from where they were a year ago at 20%, 30%. So all that stuff has happened, and yet here we are – and indeed, that has an impact on earnings and the earnings are lower. But while they are – they're lower, they're at the lower end of the range I talked about – actually, not lower end of the range – just lower than target. So I feel really good about that target over time. All those things have happened. All the things people are worried that we would go do indeed have happened. I don't think those are any surprises, by the way. I don't think that's bad management. I think all those things are the right things to do. The reason capacity has grown in excess of supply is because we do have a different business. And when fuel prices fell as much as they did, the economics changed dramatically and more capacity rightfully came in because it was profitable capacity. The wages and benefits of employees in the airline business were a big part of how this – how the industry has survived and those had to be adjusted as the industry got past survival. So look, all of that stuff's happened. All the things that I think people were worried about we've done and we still have a business that is producing returns like it's never seen before. And also, I believe all of those things have gotten to a point where you – where we start to move into an area where you see kind of a more mature industry behave like a mature industry. But look, we will see over time, but I can't stress enough how bullish we are on the future. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Yeah, thanks for that. And I guess maybe I didn't ask my question – and maybe I'd have to wait for the Investor Day, but I guess I kind of want... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Also, you – I rattled off on my tirade and I didn't – and we didn't answer your question. So Robert, what are initiatives for Dan? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, I just – yeah, the fortunate thing, again, as I said before is I think we've got some catch-up items and a number of things that we can improve on. So the list of items is long and it is something that is part of a plan that we are working through. So as I take a look, right, we have both fleet and network simplification and optimization activities that are going on right now. Some of them have been held up by integration, but the good news is, is that we have more in the hopper coming on both network and fleet. I mentioned to you about Basic Economy. We think that, that has legs throughout our system and it's just in its infancy. We think that Premium Economy will have tremendous benefits for our international network. I mentioned to you about wide-body interior improvements, notably the 777s in terms of finally getting lie-flat and density that's appropriate. I think that as I said, we have narrow-body density opportunities as well to pursue. Don has talked a lot about the RM improvements that have been made and will continue to be made and are being felt in the results that we have today. We are just now getting started on our re-launch of our sales activity and bringing on a full force of sales reps that, quite frankly, has been lacking over the last three years as we focused on other things. We are re-designing our AAdvantage program that we think will bring a considerable benefit as well. And as we've talked in the past, we think that there is a lot of benefit coming with our cobrand card as well. The list is long. And, again, we're just getting started. And a lot of this, fortunately, benefit is going to come to American. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. All right. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, go ahead. You got another question? Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Well, I was just going to say, taking what you rattled off, over the course of the cycle, these initiatives are worth what in terms – X billion dollars, $2 billion, $2.5 billion? If you can just help size it for us or, again, maybe we have to wait for the Investor Day. I'm not sure. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Wait for the Investor Day. We haven't – outside of Basic and Premium Economy, we haven't sized it and we'll be happy to shed more light on it later this year. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Operator And we'll now go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in at the end of the call here. Sorry, there's a few overlapping today. But, Doug, I missed your opening remarks here but you've been a huge proponent that this industry has changed. We just heard you respond to Dan's question about how the industry did add capacity. We are paying up labor. Earnings and margins have come down for two years now. So if you want to be getting a better evaluation like a more stable consistent industrial company, don't we need to reduce earnings volatility? And part of that process is, obviously, managing cost inflation with price inflation or the opportunities in your market. So I don't want to come across as being un-respectful to your front line employees, which definitely work hard and deserve increases but as a manager of this business, how do we talk to a shareholder that says we need to take the costs up-front, margins need to come down now but trust us. What's the inflection point that drives that better in the future? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Thanks for asking. And, again, with – I did try to address this earlier in the stuff you may have missed but I'll try again. The – I do think volatility of earnings are dramatically different than they used to be, and more importantly, the level of earnings at which we – the mean level from which you vacillate is much, much higher, and I don't – and that is different this time, and it's an enormous difference and I don't think that's been appreciated. So, but as to your volatility point, again, this is what we're doing today in terms of taking a group of our team members who was going to be, for two and a half years, paid a good bit less than their peers at other airlines, who were doing the same functions, is entirely consistent with my view that earnings are less volatile. This is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur. And once you get to that level, I think you'll see, as you do in other mature businesses, that labor costs, certainly one, you get efficiencies over time, as good businesses do. But, two, labor costs per employee increases at rates commensurate with inflation. And I think it's what you'll see in this business. But all of us had to get to a point where we got to what, really, team members in this business deserve and none of them were there because of everything we had to do to survive. So that's what I think is happening here. It doesn't affect by any means our view about the long-term value; indeed as I said at the outset, it increases our confidence in our ability to go create that value because we can't do that without an excited and engaged team. We're making huge progress in that regard. We've got some momentum with this that has us very excited and we were concerned about our ability to maintain that momentum for the next two and a half years, while asking our team to live by a contract that they just happened to sign earlier than the rest of our team, and as a result found themselves further behind their peers than the rest of our team. So that didn't seem right to us, and that's – so when we see things that don't feel right, we correct them, we don't live by contracts we have in place, and that's what we did. And we feel extremely good about that, and it makes us feel even better about the long-term prospects. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. I appreciate that response, Doug, and Wall Street can be fickle. So hopefully this works out. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. It'll work for the long term. Thanks. Operator We'll pause for just a moment. We'll go first to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning, Andrea. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Good morning, Doug. This question might be more for Robert. I was wondering if you could talk on the Basic Economy side. You mentioned how from a revenue standpoint, how customers are – or 50% of them are choosing main cabin over (79:41) and they're offered both. But I was wondering if you could talk more on the operations side of, how is it going for your gate agents, your flight attendants to implement this new fare that has restrictions on it for customers on the planes this past March? How has that gone so far on those 10 routes? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, thanks, Andrea. I think – look, we're benefiting from the tremendous amount of work that went in to planning. So we spent months and months prior to launch, prior to announcement, and did extensive training. And fortunately, I think our metered approach is working. And what we're seeing is that by and large, our customers understand the restrictions that are on the Basic Economy fare, and are complying with what our practice is at the gate. And so we're not seeing a lot of difficulty and really no issues to talk about. And I think that that's really evidenced by the kind of results that we're producing from an operational perspective, there hasn't been any impact to reliability, there hasn't been any impact on on-time departures. And I think what you'd hear from our in-flight crew is that they appreciate the benefit that comes with having fewer bags that are being brought on to the aircraft. So overall, I'm really pleased, but we're going to continue to take a measured approach and make sure that we're not surprised. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Are you concerned at all about the summer travel season when these fares are introduced, when you have fliers that maybe typically don't fly as often? Maybe this is their once-a-year sort of trip and aren't as familiar with the changes. Are you a little concerned about how that might work at the gate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, we'll be ready for it, and I think that's the key, is making sure that we let people – making sure that people are clear on what they're purchasing and certainly making sure that our team is ready to help and assist in any way possible. And at the end of the day, again, given the loads expected and strong demand, we anticipate that this will actually make things a little bit easier on the aircraft because of fewer carry-on bags. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram All right. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Good morning. Hey, this might be for Derek, I'm not sure. I wanted to ask, is there a place in your fleet for the A350? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. No, I think there is. I mean it's – but we're going to – we had a lot of wide-bodies come in. We had 787s and we had A350s coming on top of each other, so we needed to manage our delivery schedule and where our wide-bodies are. So at this point in time, yes. So we just pushed them off two years to make sure that we had a – didn't have too many wide-bodies coming to us at one point in time. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Are you considering at all maybe converting those to another Airbus model? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Not at this time, no. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Mary. Operator Moving next to Ted Reed with TheStreet. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Thank you. I have two questions about consumer perception. The first is consumer perception of the airline industry seems kind of low, and I just wonder if you made – if that was a consideration in these pay increases. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, we've been working on this for six-seven months so if you're talking about recent incidents, absolutely not. If you're – if you're asking do we think paying our team in line with our peers helps us do a better job of taking care of customers, absolutely, I absolutely believe that. But, yes, if you're asking if this is related to some high profile consumer events of recent times. Absolutely not, we've been working on this for several months. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. Second thing; in the case of the stroller incident, it seems from the video that a passenger assaulted a flight attendant. Are there any plans to have criminal charges against that passenger? Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. You lost us on that. But no. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Any reaction to the – to the video and the way the passengers – the way that the male passenger acted? Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc. Which video are you talking about? Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. The stroller video with the passenger in first class seeming to assault and approach the flight attendant sort of maliciously. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, Ted, we don't have any comment on that. We're – the – we've commented on the incident itself. It was – and did everything we could to make sure we apologized to the customers involved. We have an amazing team of people in American Airlines which is why we like to do the things that we do today. And they are out there doing incredible things every day. We sometimes, because of our policies and procedures, put them in difficult situations, we are going to work to make sure we minimize those, but we are really happy with the job they do. And we are focused – and very proud of the job they do. And obviously our customers – we look to provide great service to our customers in the same way by giving our team the tools they need for their jobs because all they really want to do is take care of our customers. So anyway, that's where we are on that, and nothing new to report. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks Ted. Operator Moving on to Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Good morning, guys. Excuse me. My question was just on Basic Economy again. Do you guys see the commercial value of that coming more from new passengers you'd attract who might otherwise fly just (85:56) other low cost carrier? Or is it more of what it enables you to do with your standard economy fares and what you're able to charge for those with this new bucket on the low end? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. This is Don Casey. The value comes – we know that there are many customers that are willing to spend a little bit more to fly on American because of the great product that we have. And under the current distribution models in the industry, it's very difficult to display anything other than the lowest fare. So by having two different products and different product attributes, this allows customers to actually make a choice which product is right for them. And we believe there are many occasions where customers are willing to pay just a little bit more to fly on American and the great product that we have. And if all they're really interested in is just having the lowest fair, that's the only thing that's really important to them, then we have a good product for them as well. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Good morning. Robert, you mentioned, or you and Don mentioned expansion of Basic Economy in May and June. Can you talk about those routes or markets? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. We're not – we're not naming any of those right now. But, again, Dawn, this is – this is something that eventually will be out to the entire network. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. You're not – you won't name them and May starts next week? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. That's when they're going to get loaded, so you'll see them soon. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Why so secretive? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. There's no secrets behind it. This is the way, that we're launching and you'll see more about it as time comes. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your speakers for any closing remarks. Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thank you all very much for your interest. We appreciate it. And we – if you have any additional questions, investors, call Dan Cravens. Media, call our corporate communications. Thank you very much. We're done now. Operator That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

[Operation Instructions] And we will take our first question from Kevin Crissey with Citi. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello, Kevin. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks. Can you provide evidence that cultural investments are more than recouped through higher revenue? Having worked at JetBlue, I can assure you that investors are unconvinced by this argument. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Kevin, what I'm certain of is that we – the leverage in this airline is in closing the revenue gap that we have. And I'm equally certain that our ability to do that, while asking our team to work for less than their peers is a big challenge and one that I'm certain either is fair to our team nor to our leadership because it makes it increasingly difficult. So I don't know that I can directly answer your question but I'm highly confident that it is correlated. And would note, again, this isn't about us making a bet that, oh, if we can go get to rates that are – pay levels that are higher than others, that will get us something that will allow us to generate higher revenues than others. I don't think I would make that argument. This is about us getting our team to the levels that are currently in place at our competitor airlines and consistent with the commitment we made to our team at the time of the merger that we would compensate them in line with their peers at other airlines, a commitment again that we've made consistently with each and every contract. But in the case of these two contracts that were done shortly after the merger and were put in place on five-year terms, which is also worth noting, longer terms than the other airlines are putting in place today. It just got to where the gap was too big and it was going to be in place for too long and that didn't feel right to any of us. So I feel good about that commitment. It's a commitment we're happy to make, not just in this case, but to any of the rest of our team to the extent we see large discrepancies in our pay rates, our base pay rates versus competitors, other airlines and there's still significant amount of time and we can get that addressed through contract negotiations. You should expect us to correct it because that's the right thing to do for our team and I think – and I do believe, Kevin, what happens so long as we do that, we have an engaged and excited team that is seeing the trust they placed in us validated and they go take care of our customers and that's the best way to take care of our shareholder. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. But isn't this taking your number one cost item and handing it over to the most aggressive competitor effectively? Whoever thinks that they can pay the most goes out and signs a contract and your labor rates are going to go to that optimistic or arguably the dumbest management team out there is an argument investors could look at. You've taken it out of your hands and put it in the hands of others and that doesn't feel like what well run companies do. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I would beg to differ. Again, given the experience levels here, and what our teams have been through. And look, we're comfortable with the commitment. You're right, in one sense, I suppose, that if you want to look at our commitment and figure out what it means for the industry, the answer is you've got to go ask others in the industry because we're, indeed, not leading this charge. We're just making sure we're staying – we're catching up. So where it goes in the future will be dependent on what others do in the future. But look, I feel, I think again, I think this is – what you're seeing here is the maturing of an industry and an industry that has seen the people work in this business go through incredibly difficult times and what we needed to have happen was that get corrected. And I think look – and I think it's largely corrected. We were encouraged to hear Delta, apparently at their Investor Day, mentioned that they put in place a 6% pay increase for all their team, for all their non-union members, which at Delta is everyone, I believe, except their pilots and their dispatchers. So the vast majority of the airline they increased 6% again this year but note on their Investor Day they thought that was their last industry reset and they would see inflationary increases in the future. So I don't know that I agree with your premise but I certainly agree with our commitment and that is we're going to make sure, because it's important that our team who is an incredibly important part of our product is excited and engaged. And it's hard to do that if they see others that do the same job they do and don't do it as well at other companies, getting compensated more on an hourly basis. So that's important to us. It will continue to be important. I don't think it's dramatically different than if you saw another airline make some major enhancement to their in-flight product, you would see us match those because it is an important part of making sure that we're taking care of our customers. And these are the people to take care of our customers, the people that are on the frontline, not just our pilots and flight attendants, our mechanics, our fleet service employees, our reservations agents, our gate agents, every single one of them deserves the same commitment and we're happy to make it. Kevin Crissey - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Kevin. Operator Moving next to Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, everybody. Doug, you have this plan to achieve pre-tax profits mid-cycle of $5 billion. Over the last year or so, it feels like you may have been retreating from that somewhat. Consensus estimates certainly don't embrace that outcome and now, of course, you're adding additional costs to your internal forecast. When do you think you'll be able to reverse direction and start moving towards that objective? Or are we doing the right thing by kind of just ignoring it? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah, Jamie, I think you referenced some comments that we made at your conference and the rest of the group may not know what you're talking about, so let me try. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Oh, I'm sorry. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. That's quite all right. And I don't know, your conference is so well attended maybe everybody knows exactly what you're talking about but I'll try anyway. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC When it doesn't snow. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, that did make it rough. So look, and importantly, I need to restate it because – I would restate it slightly differently than what you just said. Here's what I said and here's what we do. And it's a really important point so I'm glad you raised it. We believe the – we have a company today that over – on average, over time in today's current environment, should generate pre-tax earnings of around $5 billion. Now, look, it's a volatile business. We all know that. That hasn't changed. While that level of earnings is a number that no one has ever fathomed before, the fact is it's still volatile. So, we think it will average $5 billion over time. We think the better years will look around like $7 billion and the lesser years will look around like $3 billion but over time, we should expect this company can generate over time $5 billion. Now, look, that is not just a statement that we make. That is how we compensate our every one of the employees at American Airlines that get an annual bonus, so everyone essentially manager level and above. That's why this is important. We use that formula I just said to fund our annual incentive pool, and we've done that since the merger. Now again, the $3 billion and $7 billion have moved around a little bit as we've gotten more comfortable with post-merger earnings, but the $5 billion hasn't changed since the day of the merger. And maybe it will change one day but we're not changing it – we're certainly – nothing about what we're seeing today leads us to believe that should change. So that's what I reported to you all is that – that's what we think about the earnings prospects of this company. And not only do we think that, that's how we fund our incentive pool. So, again, the way the incentive pool works, not that you care that much about our executive compensation, but I think it's really important to what you think about our expectations for the business. We fund the incentive pool by telling the team, look, if we have a year where we make $5 billion, we're going to fund the incentive pool at target. If we have a year where we make $3 billion, we're going to fund it at half of target, below that, there's no bonus. And if we have a year where we make $7 billion that's the maximum, which is double the bonus. So – and you're right, no one on the Street, I think, is forecasting $5 billion for American this year. But we didn't change that formula for the team. So this – if indeed the Street is right, this will be one of those years that's slightly worse. And there will be years in the future that are slightly better. What's important about this point is that if we are right, and, again, we're not just throwing out numbers here. This is how we're incentivizing our management team. If we're right, our stock is so undervalued it defies logic in my view. If we're right, and this company is going to – over time going to average $5 billion pre-tax, really easy – really simple math and you guys are a lot better at this than me, but I'll go to the simple math, $5 billion taxed is $3 billion, $3 billion and for a company today that is trading at somewhere around – has a market cap of about $24 billion, that's eight times what I'm telling you I think is our steady state earnings. Eight times steady state earnings when the average S&P company over the last 20-something years has had a multiple of earnings of something like, help me, Dan, 19 times. Feels like people don't believe the $5 million (sic) [$5 billion] (34:05) number. And that's fine. But we do. So that's why we're so bullish on the company. And the investments we've made today only strengthen that view. We don't look at that and think, oh, gosh, now it's $300 million harder to get to $5 billion. We look at this and say this reinforces our view that we're going to continue the momentum we have in improving the revenues by these investments we're making, and we feel even better about that in the long-term. So that's what I said, and that's what we still believe. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC As part of that, it looks like it still takes considerably more American employees to get the job done than at Delta. And it's tough for me to accurately do that analysis. There's some outsourcing issues we have to account for, but there do seem to be opportunities for American to become more efficient, and your letter last night seems to imply as much but maybe that's just my interpretation. Can you quantify the opportunity to improve labor efficiency? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, I would say this. When you say it's difficult for you to do that, I would argue it's almost impossible for you to compare those numbers. There are enormous differences in the amount of work that American does in-house versus what some other airlines do outside. So you wouldn't see it in the head count or in the salaries, you'd see it, instead, in their numbers and their outside services, and we try to do similar analysis and you can't get there, I don't think. But I'll tell you this, as is the case in most mergers, when you're running two airlines, you need to have some redundancies in place that as you get through the merger, you can eliminate, and we still have some of that in place. But rather than trying to quantify it, because I don't know that we know what it is yet and/or how we're going to manage it and over what period of time, I would just point you to the guidance that Derek rattled off on our cost trends. We had CASM ex fuel in the first quarter here of 8%. The second quarter we say 6% to 8%. The third quarter we say 3% to 5%. Fourth quarter we say 2% to 4%. That includes – again, those estimates include this adjustment that we made last night. So that's a rapidly declining year-over-year increase in cost. And while we're in no position to start giving 2018 guidance yet, I would certainly expect that that trend would continue into 2018 and that is that number of 2% to 4%. And fourth quarter 2017 would be even lower for the full year of 2018. So it's coming down. The rate of growth is certainly slowing. But look, we recognize that our job is to make sure we're running the airline efficiently, and we believe we're doing so today. There are some things that because we're still running in some cases two separate airlines that may have us doing that less efficiently than we'll be able to do over time, but we'll make sure we get there as quickly as we possibly can. I think you'll start to see most of that in 2018 and, again, nothing to report now on how big that will be because I don't think we know. I know we don't know because I don't know. Jamie N. Baker - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Yeah. Doug, I appreciate you taking my questions this morning. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Jamie. Operator We'll go next to Andrew Didora with Bank of America. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good morning, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Andrew. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Doug, on that note, in terms of the $5 billion, kind of, run rate pre-tax earnings, I guess, when you consider that, and given the permanent step-up in labor, does it change your view at all of capital allocation? With these higher fixed costs, would you consider more debt pay-down over share repurchases going forward? And if not, why? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. The short answer is no. And again, I come back to the overriding point, which is this increase in our near-term expenses in no way changes our view about our long-term prospects. Indeed, it gives us more confidence that they're achievable. So nothing about this makes us think anything about – and, again, let me make one other point on that because this seems to be a theme – a recurring theme that I'm having trouble getting across. We look at this longer term than – and on the long-term, this was an expense that was coming. There's no way when we got to 2020 and did new contracts, of course, that we're going to go sign new contracts with our team that were going to keep in place this sort of a gap. So we accelerated an expense. Again, not something we do lightly and not something we had to do, something we thought we should do. But none of this, to us, feels like any sort of change in the long-term prospects, and when we think about things like share repurchase and capital allocation, we think about it in the long-term. So no, no change in that. We're really confident with our current capital allocation. We think we're doing the right thing for our shareholders, we're happy yet again, as Derek noted, to make some purchases in the quarter that were a good bit less than the price at least as we opened today, and so we feel good about that. We think we – another thing worth noting again on the capital allocation piece is, yeah, our debt is higher, but it's because our assets are better. Another point that I think sometimes gets lost, maybe our fault for not mentioning it enough, but this higher levels in debt versus our competitors is driven by the fact that we have a much younger fleet, and that fleet is a lot more valuable. There's a fleet they have in place and that drives higher debt, of course. So we feel good about the capital allocation, and we will continue to do what's best for our shareholders and our team as we go forward. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Understood. I guess, maybe kind of changing gears a little bit, maybe one for Robert. Can you talk a bit more about what you're seeing on the Trans-Atlantic, given kind of this onslaught of low cost carrier capacity into the summer? Have you adapted the way you manage inventory in response to this at all? And kind of what are your expectations for demand on Trans-Atlantic as we head through the summer? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Don give some more color. But we're optimistic about what we're seeing close in. But as you note, have concerns about capacity in the long run. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes. I mean, we – clearly, there's a lot of capacity growth, and there's a pretty active pricing environment. The industry did a big reset in terms of pricing last year heading into the fourth quarter where we've been more – a bit more aggressive versus low cost carriers. We do have easing comps. So as we go forward, I think we're going to see the comps get a bit easier. We also ran last year at relatively low load factors, U.S. point of sale demand was not as strong as we had hoped last year. Although we're seeing some weakness coming out of the UK, overall, the U.S. point of sale seems very robust this year, and we expect, as we go through the summer that we're going to run materially higher load factors than last year. Andrew George Didora - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you, everyone. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator We'll take our next question from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Hunter. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Yes. Good morning. So I know, maybe it's a question for Derek, since Derek is the one that made this comment last quarter. I know you said, obviously, it's early to guide to 2018 CASM, but just last quarter you said you think you'd be able to keep CASM ex under 2% over the next couple of years. I'm not sure if you were referring to an average number, or each of the two years? But given the new labor cost increase, do you still feel like that's doable? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, I still feel like that's doable for each of the two years, not just over the two years but for each of the two years. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC All right. Good. And then just to be totally clear, I think, Robert, you said you expect continuing positive improvements in RASM each quarter this year. You weren't saying the 3Q growth rate was going to get better than 2Q or just saying it's going to be above zero, right? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Do you want to give us maybe an early quick read on how you're thinking about 3Q, anything we should know about in terms of like calendar weirdness, or capacity or anything you're lapping, just to kind of give us an early thought, how to think about that sort of second derivative growth rate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, there's really – there was a lot of pricing action in the domestic market last year that kind of got sorted out in July that had an impact on some of the bookings through August in particular. October actually was a bit of a weak month for just about everybody last year. But other than that, I think it's nothing stands out as being dramatically impacting the last half of 2017. Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Hunter. Operator We'll take our next question from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Hey. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hi. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Just on the combination of CapEx and pension funding, can you walk us through that this year, 2018 and 2019? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. So in this year, we'll have $4.4 billion in combination, so CapEx of $4.1 billion. Pensions, we did $279 million. In 2018, CapEx – aircraft CapEx is $1.6 billion, and pension right now we're forecasting $1.1 billion. But one thing I want to note on that, that's an assumption that the mortality tables do change. If the mortality tables do not change, that'll be reduced by about $400 million, so we have the most conservative number in there. So it's $1.6 billion in aircraft CapEx and $1.1 billion in pension payments. And then in 2019, aircraft CapEx is $2.8 billion and pension payment is right at a $1 billion. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI And is that $1 billion level – for a longer-term model, is that $1 billion level kind of what we should be thinking about? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, it drops in – in 2020 it drops to $600 million; and 2021, it drops to $600 million. And those are all assuming the mortality table changes. If those don't change, then those could be modified, but it goes down to $600 million in 2020 and 2021, so I'd say the run rate is more $600 million past to the 2019 timeframe. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. And we should add $1.5 billion in non-aircraft to those numbers? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Okay. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. At least through 2020 and then I think it'll come down to about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in 2021. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks for that detail. Have you looked at – I know at least one competitor was able to go into the unsecured market and get very attractive rates to sort of advance fund some of that. Have you analyzed that? Is that something you could even do, given the higher leverage? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. We have analyzed it. We could do it if we want. We think we're – we don't have any requirement to do any payment until 2018 and don't believe we should go forward with that. I think the $1.1 billion we're doing in 2018 will get us to 80% funded which is exactly where one of my competitors went to. So that's the reason we're going to 2018. We only have to do, I think it's $60 million in 2018, so the $1.1 billion is significantly over what we're required to do in order for us to get to that 80% funded once the Airline Relief Act comes off. So, well, it's similar to what they're doing, we just don't need to do it until 2018. Duane Pfennigwerth - Evercore ISI Thanks very much. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Duane. Operator We'll go next to Rajeev Lalwani with Morgan Stanley. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hello. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Good morning. Thanks for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Robert and Don, this'll probably be for you. You – your updated RASM guide points to sequential improvement that's relatively modest versus peers and relative to just what you posted in 1Q, and you've highlighted a lot of revenue opportunities that are impressive out there. What do you think is the driver there in terms of the lack of an acceleration, given all the things that you've got going on? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'm not so sure I'd characterize it like that because in all honesty, what we're seeing is a lot of demand for our Premium cabin, and that I think is a sign that the kind of investments that we're making are taking root. We see that strength holding strong forward in the business market and from a business perspective as well. And I think that our outperformance is going to continue. It – we've got a good impressive string here, and that's what we see going forward. Don? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yes... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Go ahead, Don. I'm sorry. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Yeah. I mean, I – first of all, let's not, I guess, confuse guidance with performance. Guidance is guidance and not everybody hits their guidance. So we'll see how the actuals come in when we get through the second quarter. Although on the – from a guidance perspective, this looks like a – sequentially we're not increasing as much. But this will again be the fourth quarter in a row where our performance is better than everybody else's, and so we'll just have to wait and see where the actuals come in, in terms of year-over-year versus others. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yeah. Thanks, Don. That's what I was going to say. And again, the others may meet their guidance and we may exceed our guidance. If you're asking us to forecast the gap versus the others, we're certainly not forecasting that that gap will narrow in the second quarter. We just think we probably have – we may have different biases in our forecasting. Ours might be more conservative than theirs. But if the second quarter actuals come in and that gap closes, that's, I don't know, we'll look at why that happened if that happens, but we certainly don't expect that. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Point taken. And the other question, a bit more nuanced, can you talk about the outlook for the LatAm market? Robert, I think you provided some color for 2Q but I was looking for more, just beyond, as far as puts and takes in regard to supply demand, what South America is looking like, Mexico, Caribbean, et cetera. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. Okay. This is Don. We had, obviously, a very solid first quarter performance in Latin America, Brazil led the way. We had positive unit revenue in all of South America and low single digit declines in the rest of the South America market. As we look forward into the second quarter, we see continuing strength, actually strength improving. And in the second quarter, we expect a positive year-over-year unit revenue in every entity in Latin America that it looks very, very robust at this point. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And just broader puts and takes as we look beyond 2Q as far as what you're seeing or thinking on the supply side? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We're not really seeing anything dramatic on the supply side in LatAm, overall. We're seeing affirmative growth in Mexico but we're seeing a lot of demand growth as well, but nothing that we see that's going to change our current outlook. Rajeev Lalwani - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Very helpful. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator We'll go next to Darryl Genovesi with UBS. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for the time. Hey, Doug, you've alluded a couple of times to this opportunity to go drive some relative revenue improvement relative to your peers over the next few years. I mean, I guess, I was just hoping that you'd help characterize where do you think the relative revenue discount is coming from today? I mean, is it network or is it on-time performance? And can you help us understand, sort of, what are the components of that you think are addressable versus those that perhaps aren't as addressable? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I'll let Robert try and do that probably more in terms of the things we think we can do to close as opposed to what drivers are. Go ahead, Robert. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Darryl, I'd just like to point out that I think there are a number of things that are benefiting us that are certainly due to the investments we've been making, but in all honesty a lot of catch-up and I do think is – will benefit us and it's going to be unique to American. Some of the things that are just taking root now, as we've talked about, we are still confident that between our Basic and Premium Economy products that we're talking about a $1 billion worth of incremental revenue, which is sizable. I think everybody – I think you know that we haven't really had a premium product for our widebody long haul flying that's been consistent out in the marketplace. And so, this year we will finally have a lie-flat product across all international entities, which is fantastic. We think that we have some density issues with our narrow body fleet that we will be addressing in the coming years as well that I think will have benefits in terms of overall revenue production and also will help us from a unit cost perspective as well. Don and team have been making improvements in revenue management. And I want to underscore the work that we're doing with our sales team as well. And I'd like to say that a lot of that's baked into the current numbers, but I'm glad that as we look forward that that is just coming on, and we think is going to continue to drive outperformance versus the industry. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. So you think all that stuff, and I realize that it is difficult to see this, but if you were to take all of that stuff you that just mentioned there, which seem relatively addressable in nature and add them all up that that's enough to offset both the discount, for instance, from Delta that you're achieving today as well as what I'd call probably a positive or relatively positive impact from you already having to do a fleet in the industry. Is that a fair characterization or is there something structural about the network that's also causing you some difficulty? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. When we take a look at the list of initiatives that we are pursuing, we think that that will definitely make us competitive. Darryl Genovesi - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks very much, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Darryl. Operator And please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. We'll go next to Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Yes. Thank you very much. So, Doug, back in 2007 when you were running Airways, you said at the time you were talking to some bankers to get a sense of what the loyalty program could be worth. We've spoken to a couple of guys in private equity and they would use about a 15 times EBITDA multiple on it. That puts the valuation somewhere around $30 billion to $40 billion. Your market cap is half that. So two questions, would that surprise you, that valuation, and if it made sense to see what it was worth back then, why doesn't it make sense to do the same thing now? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, first off, I can't believe I said that in 2007, but if you say I did, okay. This has been an issue, at least from our perspective is it's part and parcel of the airline and part of running the airline and part of inventory management and something that at least in my recollection I've never considered as a particularly good idea to spend out – maybe when we forgot exactly how we financed survival it might have been something we were looking at. But so, anyway, rather than trying to figure out why I said something in 2007, I'll tell you what we think now, which is. Yes. Well, first up to your larger question, would it surprise me to learn that's the value of the advantage program? I would have to say, yes. Because that is greater than the value of American Airlines in total as we sit here today. But I am not arguing with you. You guys are better at doing valuations than we are, and the market will decide. I find it odd that simply separating something that is inside the airline today and putting it into a separate entity with the exact same cash flows would somehow generate that much incremental value, but again, that's something that you guys can figure out better than we can. But actually, I should be careful on that. If we believe that, then of course we would be spending perhaps more effort trying to figure out how to spend it out. What I believe is the advantage program is really valuable. It's an incredible part of our airline. It's a significant reason that we feel so good about our future. And we maximize the value for our shareholders. And whether or not that is done in-house or in a separate entity, that's going to be the case. And the value will be created. So we agree with you, there's a lot of value there. We agree with you that perhaps that's another reason the airline is undervalued, I just think we're undervalued for all sorts of reasons. I think people don't appreciate what's happened in this industry or this airline, and how it's going to make a difference in the long term. And that's where we're focused. As I told you last time, we agree with your pointing this out, and we will continue to try to do a better job of pointing out to investors as best we can the value of the advantage program. But it's part and parcel of the airline and a really important part of the airline and one that we're happy with the way it's being managed and the value it's producing. And it's in our – in the results of the airline today and in the future. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. I mean I guess, Doug, I would just say that the past two years at Jamie's conference, you've made your – making the lead presentation and talked about why there's less cyclicality in the business and the credit card and loyalty program isn't a part of that. So I'm just wondering, do you not mention it because you don't believe that it's an important part of improving cyclicality? Or are you just hesitant to talk about it because it seems like the first rule of having an airline cobrand card is you don't talk about the airline cobrand card? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. Fair enough. It's not that. So, yes, okay, fair enough. We should probably spend a little more time pointing out that that stream of our earnings is a little less volatile than other streams. So noted. Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thanks, Doug. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator Moving on to Helane Becker with Cowen & Company. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Thanks, operator. Hi, team. Thanks for taking the question. As I think about your domestic route network. I know you're focused on Los Angeles, and maybe you can give us a update on facilities and what you're doing there in terms of have the new facilities opening and so on. And then when I think about the growth that's occurring in Fort Lauderdale and the other side of the country, you guys have the big hub in Miami, I get it, in Latin America and so on. But do you worry about the huge increase in capacity an hour and a half north of one of your major, most important hubs and just wondering if you can comment on kind of those two issues? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Steve Johnson will take the LA piece. Stephen L. Johnson - American Airlines Group, Inc. Sure. Thanks, Helane. Just with respect to facilities in Los Angeles, we – I think everybody knows that earlier this year or late last year, we actually opened the connector between the Bradley Terminal and Terminal 4, which is in use. I got to use it personally just the other day. It's a great way to get from international connection to our domestic service or vice versa. And that's been a big hit with our customers. Then, very recently, we moved our limited operation that was in Terminal 6 to Terminal 5 and to adjacent to the tunnel that goes between Terminal 4 and Terminal 5. So those gates are now much more adjacent and much more convenient for our customers to use. And then finally, we're in negotiations with LAWA for a long-term lease at LAX that will change the face of our facilities there. Those negotiations are confidential beyond that, so I won't say anymore, but we're hopeful that we can get those completed in the next four or five weeks. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. And, Helane, I'll talk a little bit more about South Florida. So, we understand the competition and then also the nature of the markets, and so there's always appropriate consideration. But look, Fort Lauderdale, it's a nice, local market operation. We view Miami differently. We do view it as the ideal connecting opportunity and hub for American, but not just American, of any carrier to the South America. We've got a nice position there. And a lot of the work that we're doing is really to try to maximize the flows and over the long run, we do think that that is something that is going to set us apart. And you may have noticed recently that's actually helped us in markets like Cuba, where we can do things because of the connecting power of the hub, and we're going to continue to make sure that we maximize utility of that operation. Helane Becker - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Great. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Helane. Operator Moving next to Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Michael. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hey. Thanks, guys. Just two quick ones here. Bob, you talked about positive improvement in corporate share when you were talking about domestic PRASM. Any particular sectors or regions where you saw some share gains that you can elaborate on? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. It's Don. I mean, to be honest with you... Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, Don. Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. We saw improvement across the board for our – in corporate markets. And this, again, marks a kind of high-water mark for us since the merger. And in the first quarter, we had our best performance in terms of both share and share gap, and our trends heading into second quarter are also very strong. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay, great. And then just second, just a clarification on the CapEx deferral to Derek. Is that – so is that $800 million or $1.1 billion? I'm not sure if it's $300 million in two years or $300 million per year? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. $300 million per year. So it's $1.1 billion over the three years. Michael J. Linenberg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Perfect. Thanks. Operator Savi Syth with Raymond James has our next question. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Good morning. A question on the – in the last few years, I think American has been a little bit more exposed to some areas that have seen greater pressure, be it South America, be it some of the aggressive pricing on low-cost carrier markets, and we are seeing that reverse. I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on how much more we could see, or how much more there is to go? And maybe some that might not come back in the near-term? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. I mean, basically clearly we had some kind of unique headwinds that affected us, right? The Southwest growth at Love Field, the OCC growth Brazil, Venezuela. But we really kind of came out from under all that at the end of the second quarter of last year. And so, Brazil's clearly one area where we're seeing some year-over-year improvement, but the rest of that really doesn't really drive any year-over-year change. So the real value we're seeing and the uptick in our revenue performance, although Brazil is a piece of that, it's really being driven by all of the other initiatives we have out there in the marketplace. It's the new airplanes, it's the new product, it's the restructuring of our Advantage program, it's the investment we're making in sales, and the investment and change we're making in revenue management. All the things we're doing, which is a long list, right, is really what's driving the benefit. It's not just some lucky, fortunate year-over-year comparison. It's really kind of fundamental, the fundamentals that are getting better for us. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Sorry. And I meant, not necessarily a comparison issue but maybe a reversal issue of some of the pressures that you saw. Finally a follow-up on Mike's question on corporate, was – are we seeing corporate revenue and yields up now year-over-year? Is that firmly in that trend? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Actually in the fourth quarter we did see yields come up. In the first quarter of this year, we saw yields actually for corporate flattish. Savanthi N. Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thanks very much. Operator Moving on to Jack Atkins with Stephens. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just kind of going back to comments earlier around the revenue initiatives, specifically some initiatives around improving the density on the narrow body fleet. Can you just expand on that for a moment in terms of when you think that could begin to impact results and sort of the opportunity there? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So those are things that we look at on an ongoing basis. And again, some of the things that you will see showing up is the work that we've done with our wide body, our 777 reconfiguration program where we're moving to a standard configuration. So that's on that front. And we think that there's opportunities with the narrow bodies as well. And that is something that you'll see in 2018 and beyond. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. And then just kind of following up on that as well. Thinking about your prepared comments on Basic and Premium Economy, just sort of curious if you could update us in terms of how you're thinking about the portion of your domestic flights that will have those two additional classes of service on them by year-end. And then, just what sort of revenue impact that's expected to have in the back half of the year as comps perhaps get a little bit more challenging? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So in terms of Basic, that's something that we anticipate for – it will be something that we offer throughout our network. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Yes. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. So for Basic, it's really just the timing of the rollout for us, right? So, we have more markets coming in May and June. These are still, I guess, I would view as kind of test markets, the next two tranches similar to the first tranche. But we're going to end up expanding this broadly across the whole network eventually, right, and pacing item for that is really going to be our training and staffing. But we're committed to roll this out everywhere, and we're quite encouraged by the initial results. Premium Economy is the next thing. And we don't really kind of get to a critical mass of airplanes on our roll-out of Premium Economy probably until we get in first quarter of next year. So we still kind of consider what we're doing right now kind of a test, and we're very focused on this. A lot of it is channel education. We're the first U.S. airline to have this product, and so we need to make sure that all of our distribution, all of our selling channels know what the product is. And we need to make sure we work with our third-party distributors as well to make sure that the product is being appropriately displayed in all the systems, so people will understand what it is and what they're buying. And that's what we're focused on right now for Premium Economy. But, again, it will be critical mass by the first quarter of next year. Jack Atkins - Stephens, Inc. Okay. Thanks again for the time. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks. Operator And Brandon Oglenski with Barclays has our next question. Sorry. Dan McKenzie with Buckingham Research has our next question. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Hey, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Hey. Good morning. Thanks, guys. Doug, help us understand why the $5 billion pre-tax target is realistic from your perspective. You're saying it's the right hurdle for executive compensation, and I know you. You're not pulling that out of thin air. Why is that? So from where you sit, what are the larger revenue opportunities over the cycle that gives you confidence you can offset the labor headwinds this morning, and what are the new initiatives worth over the coming one to two years? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. I think Robert laid those out pretty well. He can lay them out again for you, if you'd like, as to what the initiatives are. And as to the value themselves, we mentioned that as well. Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Basic and Premium Economy we mentioned. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Right. So look, that is the value that gives us confidence. All you need to do is look at the current gap in revenue per ASM as soon as we close that, you easily get to numbers like $5 billion as a run rate number. So, look, but that's not how we go about coming up with this number. The way we come up with this number is knowing what we do about where the industry is today and where American Airlines is positioned in that industry, both of which we feel good about and both of which feel dramatically different than they've ever been before. And based upon that view, that's what this feel – that's what the company feels like to us. I don't want to portend or pretend that we go and that – those numbers I said to you are the basis of some enormous analysis that's laid out for the next 15 years. It's where we believe this company is today. And look, the facts support it. Since the time of the merger, we have had earnings in that range. This is a worse year than others, and it's still in the range. One of the things I do like to point out to people when they – part of the reason – part of the explanation, at least, I get sometimes, Dan, from investors as to why it is even if you believe what we – why it is that that we are so undervalued relative to other industries. The reason I get is, well, it's because investors are afraid you guys are going to do all the things you've done in the past to eliminate value. And as someone who's been around through all those years, I know what those things are and were, and the things that are rattled off, as you know, you're going to grow faster than – once you start making money, you'll grow faster than demand. Once you start making money, you'll give more to labor than you did when you were making less money, and they'll take some of the upside that should go to shareholders. Fuel prices will go up, and you guys won't be able to react. I would just point out this: In the last three years, all those things have happened. And that is unit revenues of – capacity has grown in excess of demand in the last couple years; and as a result, unit revenues have fallen at rates that we haven't seen in this business since 9/11. Probably more than they've ever fallen over a two-year period at any point in time. So unit revenues have declined because we've added more capacity than there is demand. Employee pay has increased at a rate that no one – that has never been seen before. And so that's happened. Fuel prices, indeed, have increased from where they were a year ago at 20%, 30%. So all that stuff has happened, and yet here we are – and indeed, that has an impact on earnings and the earnings are lower. But while they are – they're lower, they're at the lower end of the range I talked about – actually, not lower end of the range – just lower than target. So I feel really good about that target over time. All those things have happened. All the things people are worried that we would go do indeed have happened. I don't think those are any surprises, by the way. I don't think that's bad management. I think all those things are the right things to do. The reason capacity has grown in excess of supply is because we do have a different business. And when fuel prices fell as much as they did, the economics changed dramatically and more capacity rightfully came in because it was profitable capacity. The wages and benefits of employees in the airline business were a big part of how this – how the industry has survived and those had to be adjusted as the industry got past survival. So look, all of that stuff's happened. All the things that I think people were worried about we've done and we still have a business that is producing returns like it's never seen before. And also, I believe all of those things have gotten to a point where you – where we start to move into an area where you see kind of a more mature industry behave like a mature industry. But look, we will see over time, but I can't stress enough how bullish we are on the future. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Yeah, thanks for that. And I guess maybe I didn't ask my question – and maybe I'd have to wait for the Investor Day, but I guess I kind of want... William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Also, you – I rattled off on my tirade and I didn't – and we didn't answer your question. So Robert, what are initiatives for Dan? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, I just – yeah, the fortunate thing, again, as I said before is I think we've got some catch-up items and a number of things that we can improve on. So the list of items is long and it is something that is part of a plan that we are working through. So as I take a look, right, we have both fleet and network simplification and optimization activities that are going on right now. Some of them have been held up by integration, but the good news is, is that we have more in the hopper coming on both network and fleet. I mentioned to you about Basic Economy. We think that, that has legs throughout our system and it's just in its infancy. We think that Premium Economy will have tremendous benefits for our international network. I mentioned to you about wide-body interior improvements, notably the 777s in terms of finally getting lie-flat and density that's appropriate. I think that as I said, we have narrow-body density opportunities as well to pursue. Don has talked a lot about the RM improvements that have been made and will continue to be made and are being felt in the results that we have today. We are just now getting started on our re-launch of our sales activity and bringing on a full force of sales reps that, quite frankly, has been lacking over the last three years as we focused on other things. We are re-designing our AAdvantage program that we think will bring a considerable benefit as well. And as we've talked in the past, we think that there is a lot of benefit coming with our cobrand card as well. The list is long. And, again, we're just getting started. And a lot of this, fortunately, benefit is going to come to American. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. All right. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. No, go ahead. You got another question? Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Well, I was just going to say, taking what you rattled off, over the course of the cycle, these initiatives are worth what in terms – X billion dollars, $2 billion, $2.5 billion? If you can just help size it for us or, again, maybe we have to wait for the Investor Day. I'm not sure. Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Wait for the Investor Day. We haven't – outside of Basic and Premium Economy, we haven't sized it and we'll be happy to shed more light on it later this year. Dan J. McKenzie - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, guys. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Operator And we'll now go to Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for getting me in at the end of the call here. Sorry, there's a few overlapping today. But, Doug, I missed your opening remarks here but you've been a huge proponent that this industry has changed. We just heard you respond to Dan's question about how the industry did add capacity. We are paying up labor. Earnings and margins have come down for two years now. So if you want to be getting a better evaluation like a more stable consistent industrial company, don't we need to reduce earnings volatility? And part of that process is, obviously, managing cost inflation with price inflation or the opportunities in your market. So I don't want to come across as being un-respectful to your front line employees, which definitely work hard and deserve increases but as a manager of this business, how do we talk to a shareholder that says we need to take the costs up-front, margins need to come down now but trust us. What's the inflection point that drives that better in the future? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. Thanks, Brandon. Thanks for asking. And, again, with – I did try to address this earlier in the stuff you may have missed but I'll try again. The – I do think volatility of earnings are dramatically different than they used to be, and more importantly, the level of earnings at which we – the mean level from which you vacillate is much, much higher, and I don't – and that is different this time, and it's an enormous difference and I don't think that's been appreciated. So, but as to your volatility point, again, this is what we're doing today in terms of taking a group of our team members who was going to be, for two and a half years, paid a good bit less than their peers at other airlines, who were doing the same functions, is entirely consistent with my view that earnings are less volatile. This is getting to a level of compensation across the industry that needed to occur. And once you get to that level, I think you'll see, as you do in other mature businesses, that labor costs, certainly one, you get efficiencies over time, as good businesses do. But, two, labor costs per employee increases at rates commensurate with inflation. And I think it's what you'll see in this business. But all of us had to get to a point where we got to what, really, team members in this business deserve and none of them were there because of everything we had to do to survive. So that's what I think is happening here. It doesn't affect by any means our view about the long-term value; indeed as I said at the outset, it increases our confidence in our ability to go create that value because we can't do that without an excited and engaged team. We're making huge progress in that regard. We've got some momentum with this that has us very excited and we were concerned about our ability to maintain that momentum for the next two and a half years, while asking our team to live by a contract that they just happened to sign earlier than the rest of our team, and as a result found themselves further behind their peers than the rest of our team. So that didn't seem right to us, and that's – so when we see things that don't feel right, we correct them, we don't live by contracts we have in place, and that's what we did. And we feel extremely good about that, and it makes us feel even better about the long-term prospects. Brandon Oglenski - Barclays Capital, Inc. I appreciate that response, Doug, and Wall Street can be fickle. So hopefully this works out. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Okay. It'll work for the long term. Thanks. Operator We'll pause for just a moment. We'll go first to Andrea Ahles with Fort Worth Star-Telegram. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Good morning, Andrea. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Good morning, Doug. This question might be more for Robert. I was wondering if you could talk on the Basic Economy side. You mentioned how from a revenue standpoint, how customers are – or 50% of them are choosing main cabin over (79:41) and they're offered both. But I was wondering if you could talk more on the operations side of, how is it going for your gate agents, your flight attendants to implement this new fare that has restrictions on it for customers on the planes this past March? How has that gone so far on those 10 routes? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, thanks, Andrea. I think – look, we're benefiting from the tremendous amount of work that went in to planning. So we spent months and months prior to launch, prior to announcement, and did extensive training. And fortunately, I think our metered approach is working. And what we're seeing is that by and large, our customers understand the restrictions that are on the Basic Economy fare, and are complying with what our practice is at the gate. And so we're not seeing a lot of difficulty and really no issues to talk about. And I think that that's really evidenced by the kind of results that we're producing from an operational perspective, there hasn't been any impact to reliability, there hasn't been any impact on on-time departures. And I think what you'd hear from our in-flight crew is that they appreciate the benefit that comes with having fewer bags that are being brought on to the aircraft. So overall, I'm really pleased, but we're going to continue to take a measured approach and make sure that we're not surprised. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram Are you concerned at all about the summer travel season when these fares are introduced, when you have fliers that maybe typically don't fly as often? Maybe this is their once-a-year sort of trip and aren't as familiar with the changes. Are you a little concerned about how that might work at the gate? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, we'll be ready for it, and I think that's the key, is making sure that we let people – making sure that people are clear on what they're purchasing and certainly making sure that our team is ready to help and assist in any way possible. And at the end of the day, again, given the loads expected and strong demand, we anticipate that this will actually make things a little bit easier on the aircraft because of fewer carry-on bags. Andrea Ahles - Fort Worth Star-Telegram All right. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Good morning. Hey, this might be for Derek, I'm not sure. I wanted to ask, is there a place in your fleet for the A350? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes. No, I think there is. I mean it's – but we're going to – we had a lot of wide-bodies come in. We had 787s and we had A350s coming on top of each other, so we needed to manage our delivery schedule and where our wide-bodies are. So at this point in time, yes. So we just pushed them off two years to make sure that we had a – didn't have too many wide-bodies coming to us at one point in time. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Are you considering at all maybe converting those to another Airbus model? Derek J. Kerr - American Airlines Group, Inc. Not at this time, no. Mary Schlangenstein - Bloomberg News Okay. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks, Mary. Operator Moving next to Ted Reed with TheStreet. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Thank you. I have two questions about consumer perception. The first is consumer perception of the airline industry seems kind of low, and I just wonder if you made – if that was a consideration in these pay increases. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Well, look, we've been working on this for six-seven months so if you're talking about recent incidents, absolutely not. If you're – if you're asking do we think paying our team in line with our peers helps us do a better job of taking care of customers, absolutely, I absolutely believe that. But, yes, if you're asking if this is related to some high profile consumer events of recent times. Absolutely not, we've been working on this for several months. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. Second thing; in the case of the stroller incident, it seems from the video that a passenger assaulted a flight attendant. Are there any plans to have criminal charges against that passenger? Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. You lost us on that. But no. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. Any reaction to the – to the video and the way the passengers – the way that the male passenger acted? Elise R. Eberwein - American Airlines Group, Inc. Which video are you talking about? Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. The stroller video with the passenger in first class seeming to assault and approach the flight attendant sort of maliciously. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Yes, Ted, we don't have any comment on that. We're – the – we've commented on the incident itself. It was – and did everything we could to make sure we apologized to the customers involved. We have an amazing team of people in American Airlines which is why we like to do the things that we do today. And they are out there doing incredible things every day. We sometimes, because of our policies and procedures, put them in difficult situations, we are going to work to make sure we minimize those, but we are really happy with the job they do. And we are focused – and very proud of the job they do. And obviously our customers – we look to provide great service to our customers in the same way by giving our team the tools they need for their jobs because all they really want to do is take care of our customers. So anyway, that's where we are on that, and nothing new to report. Ted Reed - TheStreet, Inc. All right. Thank you. William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thanks Ted. Operator Moving on to Conor Shine with The Dallas Morning News. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Good morning, guys. Excuse me. My question was just on Basic Economy again. Do you guys see the commercial value of that coming more from new passengers you'd attract who might otherwise fly just (85:56) other low cost carrier? Or is it more of what it enables you to do with your standard economy fares and what you're able to charge for those with this new bucket on the low end? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. This is Don Casey. The value comes – we know that there are many customers that are willing to spend a little bit more to fly on American because of the great product that we have. And under the current distribution models in the industry, it's very difficult to display anything other than the lowest fare. So by having two different products and different product attributes, this allows customers to actually make a choice which product is right for them. And we believe there are many occasions where customers are willing to pay just a little bit more to fly on American and the great product that we have. And if all they're really interested in is just having the lowest fair, that's the only thing that's really important to them, then we have a good product for them as well. Conor Shine - The Dallas Morning News, Inc. Thank you. Operator We'll go next to Dawn Gilbertson with The Arizona Republic. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Good morning. Robert, you mentioned, or you and Don mentioned expansion of Basic Economy in May and June. Can you talk about those routes or markets? Robert D. Isom - American Airlines Group, Inc. We're not – we're not naming any of those right now. But, again, Dawn, this is – this is something that eventually will be out to the entire network. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. You're not – you won't name them and May starts next week? Donald B. Casey - American Airlines, Inc. That's when they're going to get loaded, so you'll see them soon. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Why so secretive? William Douglas Parker - American Airlines Group, Inc. There's no secrets behind it. This is the way, that we're launching and you'll see more about it as time comes. Dawn Gilbertson - The Arizona Republic, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back over to your speakers for any closing remarks. Daniel E. Cravens - American Airlines Group, Inc. Thank you all very much for your interest. We appreciate it. And we – if you have any additional questions, investors, call Dan Cravens. Media, call our corporate communications. Thank you very much. We're done now. Operator That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Baird  Scott Craig – Banc of America  Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Research Andy Hargraves – Pacific Crest  Operator Good afternoon and welcome to the Dell Inc. fourth quarter fiscal 2009 earnings conference call. I’d like to inform all participants this call is being recorded at the request of Dell. This broadcast is the copyrighted property of Dell Inc.. Any rebroadcast of this information in whole or part without the prior written permission of Dell Inc. is prohibited.  As a reminder, Dell is also simulcasting this presentation with slides at www.dell.com/investor. (Operator Instructions) I’d like to turn the call over to Miss Lynn A. Tyson, Vice President of Investor Relations. Miss Tyson, you may begin. Lynn Tyson With me today are Chairman and CEO Michael Dell, and Senior Vice President and CFO Brian Gladden. Brian will review our fourth quarter results, our ongoing initiatives to improve our competitive position and our working capital management activities. Michael will follow with his perspectives strategy particularly as it relates to the current IT spending environment. To get additional insights on our results this quarter, please watch the Vlog interview with Brian Gladden hosted by Rob Williams, Director of Investor Relations. We posted it on our Dell shares log right after we posted earnings this afternoon. Also we continue to refine the earnings web deck that accompanies this call to better address your questions. And so I encourage you to read it in detail. All growth comparisons made on this call are year over year unless otherwise stated. Our [I] activities begin this year with Brian at Morgan Stanley next week, and a Vlog covering global operations with Jeff Clark, Vice Chairman, Operations and Technology.  Finally I’d like to remind you that all statements made during this call that relate to future results and events are forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties which are discussed in our Annual and Quarterly SEC filings and in the cautionary statement contained in our press release and on our website.  With that I’ll turn it over to Brian. Brian Gladden  Thanks Lynn, we started fiscal year 2009 with clear and simple operating priorities focused on five growth initiatives and a plan to capture $3 billion of cost opportunities by the end of fiscal year 2011. While we did call out a year ago that we were seeing signs of spending conservatism, we saw a good start to the year before customers began to defer their IT purchases in the second half of the year.  Against this backdrop we focused our efforts on elements of our business and strategy we could control, delivering great technology, service, and value to our customers, progressing towards an industry leading cost position, and driving disciplined working capital management. Full year and fourth quarter financial results demonstrate the progress we made on several of these initiatives during the year. We’ll be the first to admit that this is a work in process and there is more to do. In my comments I’m going to focus my attention on the current environment, but you’ll find a review of our full year performance on page five and page 25 in the supplemental section of our web deck.  So let’s take a look at the P&L for the fourth quarter, which you’ll find on page six of the web deck. Revenue was down 16% to $13.4 billion as we saw a continued weak demand environment. As we announced earlier we absorbed $277 million or $0.11 after tax of expenses which were comprised of $134 million in organizational effectiveness costs and $143 million related to incremental stock based compensation.  The majority of these organizational effectiveness expenses are classified as cost of goods sold while the stock based compensation is primarily in SG&A. Gross margins have been relatively stable for the past several quarters and if you exclude the impact of the organizational effectiveness expenses and stock comp, gross margin rates were again above 18% for the quarter.  To help you better understand our OpEx progress, we absorbed $92 million in costs in the fourth quarter of last year and $152 million in the fourth quarter of this year related to the combination of organizational effectiveness, incremental stock comp costs, and the write off of in process R&D. these  items masked the progress we’ve made in our underlying OpEx run rate. Adjusting for these items OpEx was down $423 million in the quarter or 20% year over year.  This progress in OpEx puts us in a much stronger competitive position as we enter fiscal year 2010. Our tax rate for the full year was 25.4% which resulted in a 22.6% for fourth quarter. This is driven by lower profits in the US and a mix shift to notebooks. Taking all this into account, our reported GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.18. We had a good quarter of execution in managing our working capital in a challenging environment. We generated $729 million in cash flow from operations with improvements in both inventory days and receivables, offset by a two-day decline in payables.  Our cash conversion cycle remains stable at a negative 25 days in the quarter. For the full year cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. We continue to believe that over time we can generate cash flow from operations in excess of net income. Turning to liquidity and capital allocation on page nine and 10 of the deck, given the ongoing uncertainty in the credit markets and despite an increasingly attractive valuation we chose to forego share repurchases and conserve cash in the quarter.  We ended the quarter and the year with $9.5 billion in cash and investments. We continue to have access to traditional short-term and long-term funding vehicles, including a commercial paper facility of $1.5 billion of which $100 million was outstanding at the end of the quarter. As a reminder we filed a debt shelf registration early in the fourth quarter which we can use to augment our liquidity position.  At Lynn mentioned in a recent blog post, we’ve been getting a few questions on Dell Financial Services and again included additional detail on page 11 of the web deck. We saw a slight decline in our penetration rates year over year consistent with the credit tightening actions we’ve taken over the past 18 months. We’re closely monitoring the credit markets and continue to adjust our loss reserves to reflect the realities of the current economic situation.  We’re also looking for opportunities to lower our cost of funding for DFS including bringing some of the funding onto our own balance sheet. Overall we continue to be very comfortable with the profit contribution and returns we see in this business now and into the future. I’d like to talk a bit about cost, and the status of our cost initiatives which have been a big focus for us and are clearly one of the areas where we can actually control the results in this environment.  We see real opportunities to differentiate ourselves here and continue to make this a top operating priority. We can and we will continue to rapidly adjust our cost structure in an environment of slowing demand. In COGS we have made progress on design to value and in making our manufacturing and supply chain costs more variable.  Nearly 40% of business client and over 40% of our consumer platforms by volume are now redesigned and cost optimized. In aggregate we’ve reduced our average cost per box by 5%. I should point out that we’re still early in this process and expect more benefits here. As we expand our global manufacturing and logistics footprint approximately a quarter of our volume is now going through contract manufacturers.  Progress here has provided a good buffer to declining volumes late in the year as we’ve been able to use these savings to remain competitive and deliver stable gross margins. In OpEx fiscal year 2009 results show clear progress with adjusted OpEx down 6% for the full year and 20% in the fourth quarter, 400 basis points ahead of our revenue decline. Our progress here has accelerated over the course of the year and it involves reductions in all buckets of cost. We have engaged the company in our efforts on cost and we’re encouraged by our progress. As our teams have worked through these key COGS and OpEx initiatives we’ve identified an additional $1 billion in cost opportunities that we’re confident we can realize by the end of fiscal year 2011. Related to these further cost actions we’re today announcing that we expect to absorb organizational effectiveness expenses in the first quarter at a similar level to what we recognized in the fourth quarter as we further align our business to improve competitiveness. Our goal continues to be to drive a balance of liquidity, profitability, and growth an optimize cash returns regardless of the macroeconomic cycle and our cost initiatives are a big part of that. Now let me briefly turn to the performance of our business segments which you’ll find more details on in the supplemental section of the web deck.  We had strong unit growth in our global consumer business with unit volume up 18% and revenues down by 7%. Total year operating income for the global consumer business improved significantly to $143 million and 1.2% of revenue. We continue to build out our retail footprint in the consumer space and now have over 24,000 outlets on a global basis.  On the commercial side we were again disciplined in our execution. There were a few areas where we were able to drive growth but many regions and vertical segments were challenged by the economic environment and we worked to optimize margins. Our Americas commercial revenue declined 17%, operating profit actually increased from a year ago period by 160 basis points as we continued to exercise pricing discipline in this area and benefited from our strong cost management.  EMEA commercial revenue was down 17% as well, while operating margin as a percentage of revenue improved 90 basis points sequentially and enterprise revenue accounted for a larger portion of our total mix. The EMEA commercial business also took additional operating expense out of the business.  APJ commercial revenue was down 24% year over year as we saw a significant slowdown in the Pan Asian economy. Specifically we saw a pretty dramatic slowdown in both China and India. We saw a decline in China revenue while India though slower, still experienced mid single-digit revenue growth. Our total revenue from BRIC countries was down 23% from a year ago period. BRIC countries in total made up over 7% of revenue while revenue outside the US was 48% of our total mix.  Moving briefly to a few key product highlights, in the client space mobility units were flat and revenue was down 17% due to the soft demand environment globally. Desktop units were down 21% with revenue declining 27%. On enterprise products and services, server revenue was down 16% on an 18% decline in units. We experienced strong double-digit unit and revenue growth in Blades, four-socket rack servers, and our cloud computing initiatives.  Our X86 server share grew slightly in the quarter and we retained our number two position in the world. Storage had a relatively good quarter with revenue up 7% driven by strong growth in our Power Vault disk and EqualLogic ISCSI network storage solutions which were again up over 100%. Enhanced services revenue declined by 3% to $1.4 billion however our support services which deliver customizable support solutions for end users and IT professionals in Dell and non Dell environments did extremely well.  Our deferred revenue balance grew 7% to $5.6 billion in the quarter. Software and peripherals revenue declined 6% with strong double-digit growth in software sales. Now let me spend a moment on our newly announced segment structure. At the end of December we announced our intent during fiscal year 2010 to migrate our regional commercial segment to four global business units to better align our capabilities with our changing customer base.  After this realignment is complete our operating structure will consist of the following four segments, global large enterprise, global public, global small and medium business, and global consumer. We plan on showing results in this new segment structure in the first half of fiscal year 2010. Before I turn it over to Michael, let me leave you with some key points on the quarter and our views on demand.  As we’ve said in the past one of the real benefits of our direct customer relationships is that we’re able to see the demand signal earlier then other company. We saw a shift to conservatism in IT spending early in 2008 and updated you through the year on the demand trends we were seeing. We experienced a significant deterioration in demand in our third quarter and while the fourth quarter was more linear then the third the trend we saw late in Q4 and early in our first quarter is still negative as customers continue to defer purchases.  We cannot predict how deep or long this slowdown will be though we’re planning on it to be protracted. We will continue to focus on what we can control which is satisfying our customers and rapidly adjusting our cost structure to the realities of industry demand. We will selectively take advantage of growth opportunities and make investments in areas that allow us to recognize lasting competitive advantages. We believe that our new global organization is better aligned with our customers and this will enhance our ability to act on their needs with even greater speed and efficiency.  We’ve identified an additional $1 billion in cost savings to be recognized by the end of fiscal year 2011. Our teams are aggressively executing on programs to capture these benefits as soon as possible. These new and incremental cost programs combined with our previously announced $3 billion opportunity in COGS and OpEx will put us in a stronger competitive position as we move through this year.  As I said in our first quarter we now expect to absorb organizational effectiveness expenses at a similar level to the fourth quarter as we further align our business to improve competitiveness. In summary, we will continue to execute on initiatives that diversify our revenue base and product portfolio and we’ll aggressively drive broad cost reduction initiatives which over time will yield improved liquidity, profitability, and growth.  With that I’ll turn it over to Michael.  Michael Dell  Thank you Brian, in the past 16 months we’ve improved our competitiveness with our $3 and now $4 billion cost initiative delivering strong growth in emerging countries and global consumer. We broadened our product portfolio launching new enterprise Blades and Latitude E Series Notebooks for commercial customers, and Inspiron Netbooks and studio hybrid desktops and notebooks for consumers.  We have expanded our services business with new offerings in enterprise solutions and remote infrastructure management. And we’ve introduced Dell to more people in more places then ever before expanding our consumer business to over 24,000 retail outlets. Through the first half of last year we delivered 10% revenue growth on 20% unit growth. As customers deferred purchases we quickly adapted by accelerating operating cost initiatives and focusing on cash flow and profitability over growth.  For the full year we achieved strong margins with 18% gross and 5.2% operating margin or 6% operating margin net of the OE and equity compensation issues that Brian mentioned earlier. We grew faster then the industry selectively gaining share with 34% unit growth in BRIC and 35% unit growth in global consumer.  And we announced the next phase of our transformation, to global businesses that are organized around customers, organizations that allow us to best serve our customers’ needs and take advantage of the opportunities we see. Our strategy is to deliver [disruptive] technology innovation and shift our business to higher margin products and services. Proving disruptively great value to customers and partners through a direct relationship is really about making IT simpler and more productive.  And now more then ever organizations are thinking about the total cost of operating and owning IT. We want to deliver the power of the cloud and the internet leveraging Dell.com and the persistent and unique connections that we have with our customers. We want to drive price performance and feature leadership across all of our businesses by creating efficient solutions that just work.  And we want to get a larger share of the profit streams embedded in our growing installed base of hundreds of millions of products that we deliver. Opportunities like search services, 3G originations, and other telecom opportunities. As we deliver more solutions for our customers these opportunities present themselves.  The second part of the strategy is to shift our solutions portfolio to higher margin solutions and reoccurring revenue streams like those found in servers, storage, services, and software, that deliver on the first tenet of our strategy. We are driving the attachment of services onto our existing product platforms and expanding our capabilities further. Customers are very focused on outcomes. So pushing deeper into enterprise solutions is another key focus for us.  We’re going to add more capability and as we do this we find we’re involved really at the right level with these customers and enjoy more success. Finally software represents another opportunity for us to shift the portfolio. You’ve also seen us do more with customization and personalization, and we’ll take this further. Dell is a company that really drove the cost of hardware down over the last 25 years. But for every dollar that’s spent on hardware there’s $3 to $4 spent on everything else and that’s exactly where we’re heading for our future opportunities.  Let’s stop there, and we’ll open it up for questions.  Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Richard Gardner – Citigroup Richard Gardner – Citigroup You made a comment on linearity in the quarter and you said this quarter was more linear then last, which is a bit different then what we’re hearing from companies like Cisco and HP, so I was hoping that maybe you could elaborate a little more on what you saw throughout the quarter and give a sense of how dramatic any falloff that you saw in January and early February might have been and then how should we think about how quickly you can take out cost, how you’ve done a great job with cost and discretionary spending, but what is the goal here, is it to try to maintain operating margins in the 5.5% range even if we see a 15 to 20% decline in revenue for the full year, how should we think about that.  Michael Dell  I think what this really speaks to is the purity of the demand signal that we have and what I would tell you is that we did not see a dramatically volatile demand signal. We saw changes in the demand week to week but when I look at the results and some of the statements from other participants in the industry at various levels in the supply chain they are quite a bit different from what we see in the end user, end customer demand on a day to day basis.  So I think here again having this contact with customers on a regular basis gives us a great opportunity to tune the business appropriately and we feel good about that.  Brian Gladden  On the cost question, the way we’re running the business right now given this environment is really we have multiple scenarios that we’re looking at around where the demand might be and what revenue looks like. And we’ve got a series of cost actions that we’re obviously working towards. Obviously we have the confidence that we can do more then we’ve already talked about and that’s, we’ll adjust the pace and our efforts around cost given what we see from the demand environment. So I think there’s more there for us and I think we’ve shown we’ve got some good momentum there.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kathryn Huberty – Morgan Stanley Kathryn Huberty – Morgan Stanley To follow-up on the cost reduction goals, on the $4 billion which is $1 billion incremental versus the prior plan does that address the risk that the rate of demand deceleration will continue in this fiscal year or does it only consider the revenue trends you saw through January and then I believe you’re now at about $1.5 billion annual run rate in terms of savings where might you be by the end of fiscal 2010. Brian Gladden  I think in terms of run rate I think if you look at OpEx its very simple to find where we are and if you look year over year for the fourth quarter and adjust for some of the items we talked about, its about $1.5 billion of run rate there in OpEx alone. So the opportunity for us is to continue to drive both OpEx but clearly COGS we still have a lot more opportunity. That’s the, one of the charts in the web deck lays out the progress we made on those initiatives and I would just tell you that we’re early in that process and as we continue to execute on the COGS efforts there you’ll see combined cost efforts that improve the OpInc for the business.  In terms of whether its enough to keep up with the demand, its hard to say what the demand is. We have multiple cases there that we’re managing to and as we see that play out we’ll adjust as quick as we can.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein I just wanted to follow-up on that, you had mentioned that you had various planning scenarios for the current fiscal year, I guess the question is what is embedded in terms of the incremental $1 billion in cost reduction over the next two years. What is the base case planning assumption that you are setting that incremental $1 billion cost. Is it a level of year over year revenue decline consistent with what we saw this quarter or it is something better or worse then that.  Brian Gladden  I think the simple way to answer that is we’re planning on a continuation of the environment we see today and that’s sort of what we’ve got ourselves comfortable with but I would also tell  you we’ve got other scenarios that are worse then that and some that are better then that that have different operating agendas tied to them Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein And if we think about that incremental $1 billion in cost opportunity can you help us understand what the nature of those opportunities are. On page 17 in your slide deck you say reduce OpEx and headcount “as a fiscal year 2010 opportunity.” You also commented that you’re going to absorb more charges in Q1 so should we be thinking that a significant portion of the incremental $1 billion in opportunity is headcount, and I think my analysis would say if you assume the whole thing it would be 12 to 15% of your workforce. Can you comment on that please.  Brian Gladden  Not going to comment on specific headcount impacts, but I can tell you that it’s a broad set of initiatives that  cover really every bucket of cost and simplifying and streamlining the organization is part of that, but clearly there’s a lot of other costs to go after and as I said, I think COGS and product costs are clearly one of the bigger opportunities for us.  Tony Sacconaghi - Sanford Bernstein On the product cost side, it sounds like you have made pretty good progress, I think you said about 40% of your units have average COGS down 5%, if you just did that math and you said all else being equal that would lead to about a two point boost in gross margin, certainly didn’t seem like you saw that this quarter, obviously you had volume effects to contend with, but when do we start to see that impact in terms of pushing up against your or helping gross margins go up if you’re part of the way through and should be gaining more and more each quarter, when will we and why won’t we see an improvement in gross margins going forward.  Brian Gladden  I think it fully depends on demand for a couple of reasons. Clearly there’s a need to get units through the system at the new cost so the more we ship as we grow the costs go down. And we get to enjoy the benefits of those redesigns and relaunched products. I think more broadly when you think about demand and the mix environment that we see today, this cost reduction activity we’ve been through on the COGS line has given us some flexibility and a bit of a buffer to effectively manage our top line and how we play in certain markets.  So I think depending upon how the market demand plays out, you can start to see some of that and if not, we’ll use it to continue to be competitive and play in the marketplace.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope – Credit Suisse Bill Shope – Credit Suisse Looking at your gross margins, obviously I think they demonstrated your increasing focus on profit preservation versus pricing for growth, there’s been some movements back and forth here looking at the past few quarters, can you give us a sense of how this message of profit preservation is being pushed throughout the organization, we’re there material changes in the sales compensation structure, that of middle management and I guess looking forward would you characterize this as a relatively permanent way Dell will focus on the business.  Michael Dell  I think we’ve been pretty consistent here for several quarters and we’re not changing our approach. You’re right that there is a focus in terms of compensation plans, on gross margins and on mix particularly to drive mix shift further into servers, storage and services, which we saw kind of throughout the year and even if you look in the fourth quarter with a heavier consumer component. Typically we had a healthy mix of those higher margin products.  Bill Shope – Credit Suisse I guess just to follow-up on that, before this quarter if I looked at the July quarter versus the October clearly in the July quarter you said you had priced a little more aggressively then your cost allowed, or your cost savings allowed, and then you showed a nice improvement in the October quarter so what I’m trying to figure out here is sort of what is the forward plan particularly in this economic environment. Is what we saw this quarter the focus on gross margin preservation in particular is that really the marching orders you pushed through the organization going forward.  Michael Dell  Well first of all I think the way we’re running the business is around operating income and cash flow and in this kind of demand environment really the focus should be around solutions and things that differentiate the product and the traction that we’re having with customers is in, I’m talking about virtualization and managed services and those kinds of things, not trying to drive a price message.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal On cash flow could you talk about how you see the cash cycle days unfolding over the next couple of quarters, does it stay at these levels at the negative 25 type of days and related to that the CapEx was down to under $40 million, is that kind of the right CapEx run rate, if you could just talk about cash flow.  Brian Gladden  I think in terms of CapEx I think we’ve done a nice job of taking CapEx out of the business and year over year I think you’d see a pretty dramatic reduction. I think you’ll see, if you take the total year spend for this year, I think that’s a reasonable assumption for next year, maybe slightly below that. And I think that’s how I’d think about it. In terms of the cash conversion cycle, we’ve been pretty consistent that we think we can get back to even a minus 30 and that’s the sort of target that we’re aligned about.  I think the current environment with the revenue declines and how that plays out on our working capital it makes it challenging and I think we’ll continue to work to try and get back towards 30 and in a more normal revenue environment I think we’d be back there. So that’s how I’d play that assumption.  Keith Bachman – Bank of Montreal You mentioned a few different times that you’re still working on the balm to get the cost of the units down, given what you’re seeing so far in February is it reasonable to assume that gross margin stays roughly at these levels even against what you’re seeing roughly in the April quarter.  Brian Gladden  That’s what we’re working towards but its about OpInc for us and if we have all of these cost initiatives are aligned around driving towards an OpInc answer for the business and that’s how we’re driving the teams.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital    Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital    Did you accrue a bonus in the quarter and if so how much was it or if you didn’t how much did it help costs and then what is you plans for bonus accrual for this year and how does that impact the costs on a year over year basis.  Brian Gladden  We did accrue a bonus in the period and we plan to have one in fiscal year 2010. That’s it.  Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital    So it wasn’t a material factor in the OpEx reduction though.  Brian Gladden  It was not.  Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital    With regard to cash flow, I was just, HP also had cash usage from payables and cash generation from AR and that kind of was the result of the linearity of the quarter that got weaker, you had that as well but you said the quarter was more linear, can you just explain your cash flow dynamics, what’s going on with the payables versus receivables just so we can get more confidence that you generate cash next quarter instead of going back to a usage.  Brian Gladden  The receivables is purely a function of the volume and the revenue in the business and the timing of that. The linearity of that revenue. As I said we did see deterioration of demand and revenue during the quarter but not to the extent that we saw in the third quarter so it wasn’t as, it didn’t deteriorate as quickly. In payables as you know, as our COGS levels go down, as OpEx spending goes down, as you also know we took inventory down, all of those things reduce the level of payables in the business and that’s how you see a contraction in the payables performance in the quarter.  So I think when you look forward a lot of it’s really got to be modeled around what you see in terms of revenue and demand. And if you can model that out I think its math around the rest of the cash performance.  Ben Reitzes – Barclays Capital    What was currency in the quarter and what tax rate should we use to model you in FY10. Brian Gladden  Currency was negligible and tax rate something in the 25, 26 range for next year would be a good assumption.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan Can you talk a little more about the gross margin profile in terms of COGS. In one of your slides you talk about 25% of the volume now going through contract manufacturing, how should we think about that bogey for 2010. Is there any sort of hesitancy among the contract manufacturers that take on excess capacity in this type of environment.  Brian Gladden  We haven’t seen that and we continue to move more in that direction. I think that will be one of the levers as we look at cost reductions during the course of the year in this environment and— Michael Dell  That’s absolutely right. We continue to go further in that direction and wouldn’t be surprised if that number go up. Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan On the operation margins with respect to consumer you’re having some good uptick there in terms of revenues relative to the other parts of the business, can you talk though about the commensurate or lack of commensurate boost in your operating margins for that business. Is this a function of just the cost structure or the supply chain not yet optimized for higher volumes. Brian Gladden  I think the dynamics are consistent with what we talked about in the third quarter for consumer. There are multiple sources of revenue and margin in that business. They can be a little bit more lumpy. I think the way to think about profitability there is that we generated a 1.2% OpInc for the year which is a great improvement over where we were the year before. And we continue to track and improve that business and our target is as we’ve said 2% in the short-term and I think we made progress there.  The team has done a great job taking cost out of the consumer business, there’s no question and I think the retail footprint expansion and top line growth in the quarter was pretty good. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank  Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank  I wanted to follow-up on the last question with respect to your existing internal manufacturing should we anticipate more plant shutdowns given that you’re increasing your usage of contract manufacturers while unit volumes declined significantly, I would expect there to be meaningful excess capacity within your network.  Michael Dell  I think we’ve said that we’re in the midst of a review of our manufacturing capacity and we’ve talked about using additional contract manufacturers as one alternative for us, but haven’t made any decisions that are ready to go yet. We’re continuing to look at it.  Brian Gladden  The end game there could take on several different forms. So when we’re ready to talk about it we’ll announce it.  Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank  Do any of the manufacturing partners have the appetite to take on more capacity, more manufacturing capacity at this time.  Michael Dell  We haven’t seen any lack of interest in our discussions with contract manufacturers.  Chris Whitmore – Deutsche Bank  Around Windows 7, are you seeing any behavior changes from your enterprise customers as it relates to Windows 7, is that creating incremental deferrals of purchasing in your estimation.  Michael Dell  Well I don’t know how much of this you’ve heard but we’re starting to get pretty excited about Windows 7 and believe its going to be an important catalyst for growth. Now having said that it will also push purchases until Windows 7 comes out so the discussions that we’re having with larger customers are all around making sure that they’re kind of ready for Windows 7 and waiting for Windows 7 and investment protection kinds of things in the, in any devices they might install this year.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross – Cross Research Shannon Cross – Cross Research A question with regard to your balance sheet, if you could talk a bit about how you expect it to trend. You talked about working capital but I’m also curious on inventories and I’m also curious as to how you’re looking at your debt balance or your ability to raise debt, CP versus the [inaudible] securities market, you obviously have your debt shelf. Just you know as we assume most of your cash is offshore, how should we think about how all these pieces will play together in fiscal 2010. Brian Gladden  Clearly a priority to maintain and manage our liquidity for us right now. I think as you said we do have the debt shelf out there. We have access to commercial paper and those seem to be viable alternatives and we’ll be opportunistic there where it makes sense but I also think we do have opportunity to improve our working capital performance including inventory levels and we made some progress in the quarter taking out almost $200 million of inventory. I think there’s more there.  We’ll continue to work on working capital as one way to sure up the balance sheet in this cycle.  Shannon Cross – Cross Research Should we look at finance receivables continue to be a use of increasing use of cash during the year.  Brian Gladden  I think so, as we look at the DFS business and how we feel about the growth there and what that enables for us in the rest of our business, its just a cost of capital decision in terms of how we fund those activities in DFS. To the extent that it’s a better answer for us to put that on book versus use other vehicles, then that’s what we’ll do and I think that’s what you saw in the quarter.  Shannon Cross – Cross Research Nobody’s asked the Netbooks question yet, so I’m curious as to how you’re seeing the Netbooks market trend, concerns on ASP, just any color you want to give us there.  Michael Dell  We see the Netbook for us with a relatively low share in consumer as part of the consumer opportunity but I continue to believe its mostly incremental. And even more so given our share in consumer. We’re continuing to expand the offering. We’ve been particularly focused on 3G and agreements with carriers imbedding 3G, using our own sales engines as well, to sell 3G Netbooks and obviously broadening the range of products starting with 9, 12, and now 10”.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of David Wong - Wachovia  David Wong - Wachovia  Can you give us the approximately cash conversion cycle of product that goes through contract manufacturing.  Brian Gladden  You know its about the same as what we have for the rest of business. There’s not a whole lot of difference there given how we’ve structured those arrangements.  David Wong - Wachovia  You mentioned investment protection needed, some customers thinking about investment protection in anticipation of Windows 7, are there specific hardware characteristics you need to build into your products to make things Windows 7 compatible.  Michael Dell  Well they’re thinking about all the features in Windows 7 and anticipating which of those they might use and ensuring that products are supported around those. We have aggressive plans in this area and I think as you see our products roll out over the course of the year, its fair to say they’re all Windows 7 ready and we’re kind of all over this being the leading provider to larger organizations. We know a lot about selling into and investment protection mindset.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Maynard Um – UBS Maynard Um – UBS If I can ask the gross margin question a little differently, it obviously looks like the mix, mix was the biggest help to gross margins in the quarter and if I’m doing the math correctly it looks like your desktop, mobility, and S&P gross margins are down to around 11% and around 14% at the beginning of fiscal 2008, with some of the actions that you’re taking on on improving COGS do you think we’re bottoming at these levels and I’m more particular focused on these three segments so not taking into account mix.  Brian Gladden  I don’t know that, its really hard to tell what future gross margin dynamics are going to be. I think really tied to the demand environment and the competitive environment. Again as I said we’re doing everything we can to get cost out of the box and get our overall costs out so we can actually be competitive no matter what happens. I think I wouldn’t get into commenting on the specific product lines and what we’re doing there, but we’re focused on cost programs in all of them.  Maynard Um – UBS Related to the Netbook channel with wireless operators, what percentage of your mobility units do you think you can move through that channel over time and do you actually get any kickbacks from operators if a customer signs up for a wireless plan. Brian Gladden  It’s a pretty small percentage today. Certainly we’re very focused on 3G originations and how the inclusion of 3G radios in our products increasingly and positively effects the economics.  Maynard Um – UBS Can you just talk about levels of inventory in the indirect channel.  Brian Gladden  We don’t have inventory in the indirect channel, that’s really all we can comment on.  Michael Dell  Just to be clear, we do have some retail inventory. Our channel partners tend to have very, very little inventory. Most of them pass through inventory directly from our factories and contract manufacturer factories directly to the end point of use so any, the inventory we would have in the channel, we’ve been monitoring, measuring that very, very carefully to avoid the inherent risks that present themselves there and I think we’re doing a fine job there.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jason Noland – Robert W. Baird  Jason Noland – Robert W. Baird  You were talking about shifting the portfolio, I guess could you comment on the pace at which we could expect a shift and then organic development versus inorganic.  Michael Dell  The shift is the big focus particularly as we organize the new commercial businesses, in terms of the large enterprise, public and SMB, we’ve created a number of new offerings, new capabilities will be created organically some with partnerships and acquisitions as well. We continue to make small acquisitions and we’ll certainly look for additional ones.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Scott Craig – Banc of America  Scott Craig – Banc of America  On the financing business it looks like the loss reserves are up to around 10% now did we see that stabilize at all during the quarter or was it still kind of trending worse as we exited the quarter and we enter into the month of February and then on the retail business I think you mentioned around 24,000 points of purchase now, is there a goal for that as you work into this fiscal year where you want to be at some point.  Brian Gladden  On the financing receivables, or the losses in the financing portfolio its, I guess as we plan out the year and we look forward we would expect that to probably continue to be tough. I won’t comment on the trend during the quarter but we look at it constantly. We’ve taken significant actions to tighten credit down. We’ve done some pricing actions and other fee actions to mitigate some of these higher losses but we feel very comfortable with where we are in terms of the reserve for losses. We took it up in the quarter and we’ll continue to watch that as we go forward.  In terms of retail, we don’t have a goal as to where we end up there in terms of number of retail outlets. We’re methodically adding what we believe are the best and strongest retailers in the world. There are a number of retailers who are pretty upset with us right now because we haven’t offered our products through them, but I think its fair to say that the number of potential outlets is a couple of multiples greater then the current number.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Research Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Research If I could go to the component costs, can you give the gives and takes during the quarter. You mentioned that you’re seeing a more normal environment year, what did you see in the previous quarter and what are you seeing near-term on components and the effect of gross margins. Brian Gladden  I would say our point was I think in the fourth quarter it was more a historical normal component environment. I think it was a little bit better in the third quarter. We saw more component deflation in the third quarter and as we look out through the year, I think there’s going to be puts and takes in various categories of components but I would say we’re characterizing it as a normal environment on average. Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Research So no advance buys required here.  Brian Gladden  No, we’re managing our capital pretty tightly.  Bill Fearnley - FTN Midwest Research On the facilities, you had mentioned before you were thinking about trying to sell some of those facilities, any update there.  Brian Gladden  No.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Andy Hargraves – Pacific Crest  Andy Hargraves – Pacific Crest  On the Netbooks your answer suggested that there isn’t really, or your not expecting adoption of Netbooks in corporate environments is that the case and maybe why since they seem to be good devices for taking advantage of cloud computing and software and service type stuff.  Michael Dell  Well its certainly possible but so far what we’re seeing is that the corporate users tend to prefer machines with larger screens, even if you look today, we offer corporate Notebooks at the 12”, 13”, 14”, 15”, 17” screen. The most popular one is the 15”. And its possible that there may be a move to smaller screens but the visualization of data is still very important to the users so we’re just not seeing a lot of demand for that.  Andy Hargraves – Pacific Crest  As a follow-up on that consumer question, as you expand to more outlets is there a diminishing return on that or are you seeing a diminishing return on that especially the operating income line.  Michael Dell  I would say its been more geographic, we kind of started in the US and China and now we’re pretty focused on some of the big opportunities in Europe and so we’re kind of taking it a region at a time and doing it pretty methodically but certainly our intent is to continue to have a healthy and profitable consumer business.  Okay, so let me thank you all for joining the call today. We have the financial strength, unique customer relationships, and we have a very strong brand. We’re aggressively improving our competitiveness and our execution while delivering solid profitability and maintaining a very strong balance sheet. We’re very focused on providing disruptively great value to customers while shifting our portfolio to higher margin products and services.  Thanks again for joining our call. We look forward to talking with you again soon.  Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Peer M. Schatz Thank you, John. Hello, and welcome to our conference call and the opportunity to discuss our results. As you saw in the release last night, we achieved our adjusted net sales and EPS targets for the second quarter and reaffirmed our full year guidance for our adjusted net sales and earnings targets based on the performance for the first half of 2013. We had strong demand for our portfolio of Molecular Diagnostics growth drivers and delivered higher sales in this overall customer class, despite the anticipated slowdown in revenues related to HPV screening. In the Life Sciences, we saw a different picture than in the first quarter of 2013 with growth in Pharma and Academia, but weaker results in Applied Testing. All regions contributed to growth and were led by the top 7 emerging markets. We're making progress on our goals for 2013. In Personalized Healthcare, a highlight was the recent FDA approval of our EGFR companion diagnostic kit. This was granted simultaneously with the FDA approval of Gilotrif, which is the brand name for afatinib from Boehringer Ingelheim, as the new first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer. We also reached new confidential agreements for companion diagnostic co-development projects, both within existing partners and also with new pharma companies. We are on track to begin the launch of our sample-to-insight next-generation sequencing benchtop workflow in 2013. We have reached an important milestone with placements at early access customers. Our ambition is to drive the use of this breakthrough technology in clinical research and diagnostics by offering a fully integrated workflow from biological sample to highest-quality data interpretation and actionable results. The very positive response to our Ingenuity acquisition reaffirms our conviction that our gold standard in biological data interpretation will be a crucial differentiator for QIAGEN. It is not just about sequencing samples, but instead, about offering a complete, high-quality workflow and one that provides the most powerful insights. In terms of the QIAsymphony automation system, placements continue at a strong pace with placements up 15% in the first half of the 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, which was already a record year for QIAsymphony. We are well on track to break through 1,000 cumulative installed systems during 2013 and continue to see robust double-digit growth in consumables. And the last point to mention on this slide is of the completion of the major efficiency project that we began in late 2011. QIAGEN has been going through a transformation as we streamline the organization consolidated sites and reallocated resources to growth initiatives following a series of bolt-on acquisitions. The last set of actions involved resigning the sales and regional marketing teams in the United States and Europe. Given the changes in our markets and also the QIAGEN portfolio, we wanted to better address customer needs across the continuum from basic research to translational medicine and into clinical diagnostics. We continue to have the only U.S. clinical sales force in the Molecular Diagnostics industry and a strong share of voice in our market segments. As Roland will discuss later, the restructuring charges for these projects are going to end in 2013, and we realize that it is time for us, even in more in light of these charges, to deliver on generating tangible benefits for these actions. We are convinced that these actions have strengthened QIAGEN considerably and will play a key role in accelerating sales growth and improving profitability. Finally, you saw in the release that we announced plans for a new $100 million share repurchase program. This is a signal of our conviction in the growth opportunities of QIAGEN, especially as we complete the sufficiency program and also that we are not satisfied with the current valuation. As we launch this program, we are maintaining our flexibility to take advantage of strategic opportunities, while increasing returns to shareholders. Turning to Slide 5. I would like to review the results of our customer classes. Molecular Diagnostics led the performance and provided about half of sales. In Prevention, the QuantiFERON latent TB test continued to grow at a 20% plus constant exchange rate growth rate with the fastest growth in the United States. Our teams are driving conversion based on QuantiFERONs superior accuracy and aided by delivery problems for the tuberculin, the derivative needed for the 120-year-old competing TB skin test. In Personalized Healthcare, we saw a mixed picture. Sales of companion diagnostic kits rose at a double-digit pace but the Pharma co-development project provided lower revenues. We are seeing improved demand for Companion Diagnostics in the United States as uncertainty over reimbursement is clearing up, and we expect new growth impulses from the EGFR approval. Our Profiling business, again grew at a good pace, supported by rising sales of consumables used on QIAsymphony. As I mentioned QIAsymphony placements are growing at double-digit pace. And the related assets in Consumables sales are also growing at a high double-digit rate. The majority is in Molecular Diagnostics and the percentages placed as reagent rentals continue to rise. Although we are creating multiyear revenue streams, this weighs on current instrument sales. Staying [ph] in Molecular Diagnostics, sales of products for HPV testing fell 17% in the second quarter, which is more than the single-digit decline in the first quarter, but this is something we had anticipated and there are some year-over-year baseline reasons. It is more important to look at the year-to-date trends. For the first half of the 2013, global HPV sales are down about 10% constant exchange rate representing 15% of total sales and we continue to expect about a 10% decline in HPV sales for 2013. The challenges are in the United States where we face significant pricing pressure as new competitors search for market share gains. QIAGEN maintains a solid leadership position in the United States with our test ranking as the gold standard. We announced in June that a major U.S. reference lab had reached a new nonexclusive agreement to consolidate the purchase of women's health screening products and I want to make a few points. First, they will continue to offer our HPV test to customers. Second, the transition to the competitor HPV test is 1 of 4 products trying to be converted simultaneously and this will take time. And third, we see no signals of other laboratories wanting to consolidate suppliers. The reason is clear, labs want to have the freedom and flexibility to adapt. They also want to offer gold standard tests since this is what customers are demanding and no single supplier can do so across a broad menu. Our position as the gold standard is the key reason why labs are sticking with our HPV test. We continue to sign labs to new multiyear agreements and we'll remain the market leader. As for the impact in 2014, we expect this customer development to have an adverse impact on our results but this is to represent less than 2% of our anticipated 2014 total adjusted sales at the worst. We also continue to expect U.S. HPV product revenues to represent less than 10% of total sales in 2014. Before moving on, I would like to note that Ingenuity revenues were booked in the Pharma and Academia customer classes. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a change in trends in the Life Sciences from the first quarter of 2013. Applied Testing sales were down and faced a tough comparison to the outstanding instrument sales in 2012. However, we saw solid growth in consumables, and we expect overall positive trends here for overall 2013. Finally, a return to growth on higher sales in all regions after the significant slowdown in the first quarter. Academia sales were also slightly higher in comparison to the second quarter of 2012 as emerging markets more than offset the ongoing cautious spending in the United States and Europe. In the U.S., sales are obviously, under pressure due to sequestration. But we are not experiencing market share losses, just overall restrictions on spending. The European landscape did not change during the quarter as we continue to see cautious spending patterns. Also the anticipated government funding impulses in Japan have not yet materialized. And now on Slide 6, to review the completion of our major efficiency project. We have made transformational changes that were designed to address the fast-changing industry conditions, as well as issues specific to QIAGEN. These included the reallocation of resources to growth initiatives, in particular to nextGen sequencing. The sufficiency project had 5 areas of focus and we have streamlined organizational structures and eliminated duplication. We focused our R&D portfolio and project to offering high growth potential and improved processes to accelerate innovation. We improved capacity utilization to increase efficiencies by closing down some sites as well, such as Hamburg, Morgan and Crawley. We optimized sales and marketing channels to better identify address customer needs, we captured savings from the expansion of shared services, such as the new service center in Poland and the outsourcing of some IT activities creating functions that can be efficiently scaled as QIAGEN grows. We've taken a $76 million pretax charge in operating income in the second quarter and this was to cover the following types of initiatives. One, closing some sites and integrating their activities at our global hubs in the United States, Germany and China to gain efficiencies. Two, financing changes in our R&D portfolio to put more emphasis on faster growing areas. This included allocating more resources to the NGS initiative and deemphasizing HPV-related R&D projects. And last, changes we have made in our commercial and marketing organizations. So the question is, why were they charged much higher than we had forecast? The answer is that we decided to take the opportunity to accelerate and expand the range of efficiency projects, which we had originally planed in light of industry trends, including M&A actions. We want to get this finished and we have. Many of you know QIAGEN well and some of you are very familiar with the new structures, processes and initiatives. The company is quite transformed and we are using this strength to push for higher growth. We are convinced that the benefits of these actions will become even more evident in 2014 and beyond. This was one of the motivators behind the decision to launch a new share repurchase program. I would now like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Yes, thank you, Peer, and good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those who are following from the U.S. I'm now on Slide 7 to provide some perspective on our performance in the second quarter of 2013. Adjusted net sales were USD 316.4 million, representing 3% growth at constant exchange rates or the same period a year ago. This was ahead of our target for our 1% to 2% constant exchange rate wise. About 2 percentage points of the growth came from AmniSure, which was treated as acquisition until May 2013 and also from the recent acquisition of Ingenuity while the rest of the portfolio provided about 1 percentage point. Currency movements had no meaningful impact on our reported results. The adjusted gross margin was steady at about 71% compared to a period a year ago. Similar to what we saw in the third quarter of this year, there was a benefit from the mix towards more consumables and also from efficiency programs. Adjusted operating income declined 3% to $83.4 million and the adjusted operating income margin declined to about 26% of net sales compared to 28% in the year-ago period. R&D investment returned to a more normalized rate of about 10% to 11% of sales in the second quarter of 2013, in part as a ramp up assay development program and clinical trial to expand our menu on QIAsymphony and drive our NGS program. Sales and marketing expenses were also higher given the investments being made into the NGS initiative, including Ingenuity, as well as to expand QIAGEN's commercial presence in key markets. Adjusted pretax income, which you do not see on this chart, however, it was about 3% to USD 82.9 million. This was due in part to nonoperating income generated in the second quarter of 2013 from providing access to QIAGEN's technologies. We provide access to other partners and on our team basis as part of our commercial utilization strategy and proceeds are treated as other income when it relates to noncore technologies to avoid distorting operational performance. Adjusted net income was up 6% and adjusted EPS was $0.27 per share, which was ahead of the target for $0.25. I'm now on Slide 8, which provides an overview of all regions delivering growth at single-digit constant exchange rates. The top 7 emerging markets led to performance with 12% constant exchange rate growth and provided 13% of total adjusted net sales. In the Asia Pacific and Japan region, sales were also about 8% constant exchange rate wise. China and India delivered double-digit gains while sales declined in South Korea. Our women's health initiative in China has been gaining momentum due to government-initiated HPV screening programs. And we saw more positive trends in the Pharma and Academia customer classes compared to the first quarter. In Europe, where net sales was 2% constant exchange rate wise, important contributions came from the United Kingdom, Turkey and the Nordic region. The Life Science funding trends remain an issue in this region given the austerity measures, while Molecular Diagnostic sales were supported by QuantiFERON-TB and the ongoing rollout of the QIAsymphony platform. The Americas region grew 2% constant exchange rate wise and contributed 48% of net sales. Solid quarter in Brazil and Mexico led the performance among the countries. While sales in the U.S. were largely unchanged as the expansion of our molecular diagnostic growth drivers offset lower HPV sales and ongoing soft market conditions in Pharma and Academia. I'm now on Slide 9 and will provide a few comments on the sales of consumables and Instruments. Consumables and other revenues provided about 87% of total sales and were up 5% constant exchange rate in the second quarter on a mix of contributions from AmniSure, Ingenuity, as well as the rest of the portfolio. Revenues from instrumentation contributed about 13% of total adjusted net sales, declining 8% constant exchange rates over the second quarter of 2012. Even though sales were down, we had a strong double-digit growth in QIAsymphony placements. Capital spending trends also weighted on instrument sales among customers in Academia and Pharma, while Applied Testing sales were down against the very strong sales in the second quarter of 2012. I'm now on Slide 10. We are now halfway through the year building momentum and focus on our sales goals for 2013. As you see, adjusted net sales [indiscernible] 3% at constant exchange rates to $620 million, again on a mix of contribution from the AmniSure and Ingenuity acquisitions, as well as growth in the rest of the portfolio. Adjusted operating income was down 3% to about USD 162 million as we continued making important investments. At the same time, we expect profitability to improve during the second half of the year, in line with expectations for faster sales growth. Our goal remains an adjusted operating margin of about 28% for the full year in 2013 and as we have said, this takes into account about 100 basis points of dilutions from the Ingenuity acquisition and the related investments. Moving down the income statement, adjusted net income was 3% and adjusted EPS rose to $0.49 per share. On Slide 11, you see a snapshot of our healthy financial position, which takes into account the Ingenuity acquisition in April. As of June 30, 2013, we had a good level of liquidity at USD 373 million, which compares to $266 million at the same date in 2012. Also as of June 30, 2013, net debt amounted to USD 491 million compared to USD 416 million at the same date in 2012. After the Ingenuity acquisitions, our level still remains at about 1 turn [ph] of net debt to adjusted EBITDA so we continue to have flexibility to support business expansion, as well as to increase returns, such as through the new USD 100 million share repurchase program that we just announced Our cash flow performance is obviously, affected by the restructuring change taken to complete the efficiency project. The current estimate is for the restructuring charges being taken for the efficiency project to have an impact of about USD 60 million in free cash flow for the full year 2013. But given our expectations for no material restructuring charges in 2014, we see opportunities for significant improvement next year. I would now like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. I would like to now provide some views on our strategy to leverage our leadership in Sample & Assay Technologies across all of our customer classes. On Slide 12, you see we are using the categorization to Sampling & Assay Technologies, to list the topics I will talk about. First, Quantimodal [ph] marks the beginning of a series of launches for a new generation of realtime PCR kits, PCR is still the work horse of every molecular biology lab and a key componens in Molecular Diagnostics and a number of actions being performed is increasing. QIAGEN has to date sold far more than 1 million realtime PCR kits to more than 7 thousand customers, representing hundreds of millions of dollars of sales. Building on this success and our expertise, the portfolio of Quantimodal [ph] kits are being utiliized to further expand our position in the growing realtime PCR market by enhancing the specificity and sensitivity of probe-based realtime PCR. The first product launches are planned for this year. As for the other products you see here, I will provide more insights in the next few slides. Moving to Slide 13. Last week, we announced the new collaboration with Exosome Diagnostics to create high-performance, biofluid sample preparation kits for Personalized Healthcare. The initial product launches are targeted for 2014. Our goal is to develop and market the first comprehensive line of products that enable the use of biofluids to explore and monitor disease status. This will be a breakthrough from the current reliance on tissue samples, which when highest quality results can be obtained, require biopsies in patients that can be challenging and expensive. Exosomes are one of the many different subpopulations of microvesicles that can be isolated from biofluids, such as blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid. And you can extract and purify high-quality RNA and DNA from analysis from them. Exosomes carrying nucleic acids and proteins from their host cells, and they are more widely considered to be essential for biomarket discoveries for Personalized Healthcare diagnostics. We believe that offering standardized, easy-to-use exosome workflows will offer superior testing solutions for use in a wide range of detection platforms, particularly realtime PCR and next-gen sequencing. I'm now on Slide 14. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving ahead at a rapid pace with our next-generation sequencing initiative, targeting clinical research and diagnostics. Workflows have now been placed with customers for early testing, and we're preparing for the start of the phase rollout later this year. We've been developing this workflow with clinical research and diagnostic customers as our top priority and addressing their concerns about current systems. These include too many manual processing steps, having to rely on various vendors to get the job done and being required to batch samples to get cost efficient runs. One of the most important online needs in today's next-generation sequencing solutions is the availability of integrated data interpretation options. These newest customers cannot get a complete offering from biological sample to actionable insight. These insights are increasingly where the value will be created with next-generation sequencing data, such as providing a research with new clinical insights to advance a project or even a physician receiving ideas to consider in making treatment decisions. Based on feedback from our customers, the addition of Ingenuity to the QIAGEN ecosystem was clearly the right decision. We want to do more than just generate sequencing data. We want to generate high-quality data and provide the most valuable insights. This is what QIAGEN Ingenuity can do together and we see this as a key differentiator to drive adoption of our next-generation sequencing workflow. Ingenuity is far more than just a data interpretation solution for NGS applications. We are moving ahead to create seamless solutions for our customers to meet the world's leading resources for interpretation of biological information, altogether, into our range of platform technologies and content to drive science, drug development and clinical diagnostic use. And then in solo position, QIAGEN is a unique player with a constant interpretation-centric ecosystem to serve continuing customers' needs from basic research through to diagnostics. Ingenuity is accelerating scientific discovery and enhancing patient care by providing rich, accurate and visual insights into complex -- but complex biological systems. One of the value propositions of this acquisition is to embed Ingenuity's dry lab interpretation solutions into wet lab molecular assays. Many of you know that we have successfully built such a franchise with our GeneGlobe molecular assay content portal, which offers hundreds of panels for PCR and next-gen applications, as well as more than 60,000 fully annotated assays for the most sought-after diseases. So the opportunities with GeneGlobe and Ingenuity together in our product offering are going to be fascinating for our customers. Moving to Slide 15. I would like to share an example as to what makes Ingenuity the #1 choice. Ingenuity offers the deepest and broadest understanding of biological -- of biology compared to competitors. The superior quality of this content, which has been built up with massive investments over more than a decade, is due to the involvement of scientific experts and key opinion leaders who mainly create and ensure quality control in addition to automated calling. This is simply lacking with competitor products and it has a major impact on the quality of interpretation. [indiscernible] differences can lead to distortions and a lack of reproducibility in scientific or clinical interpretation especially if customers are [indiscernible] millions of data points. So we see Ingenuity's knowledge base and intuitive applications providing a sustainable competitive advantage for years. The gold standard solution for next-gen sequencing is Ingenuity's Variant Analysis. It answers a critical need for researchers trying to rapidly identify relevant cost in variants in these human diseases in a matter of hours. Next-generation sequencing customers are making it very clear that the issue is the months or years it can take to make sense of sequencing data. Variant Analysis alleviates this bottleneck and we want to integrate it into a complete sample-to-result sequencing solution. The power of the Variant Analysis is reflected in the recent announcement of the National Cancer Institute in the United States, which generated the largest data set of cancer-specific genetic variations to date. This new data contains 6 billion data points that connect drugs with genomic variants for the whole human genome. It is designed to provide a better understanding of these genetic variations and how they impact drug response in cancer patients. Ingenuity played a key role in supporting the creation of this data set as researchers use Variant Analysis and the value of Variant Analysis as an important way to disseminate the results has been recognized and how the NCI is now making the data available. In addition to its own database solution, the NCI has chosen to make it also available via Ingenuity. So this is another validation for Ingenuity's position as the gold standard for biological data interpretation. We are convinced that the rapid uptake of Variant Analysis already being used in more than 2,500 users of more than 1,000 leading institutions worldwide will continue at a dynamic pace, given its reputation as the gold standard for NGS data analysis. I'm now on Slide 16. A highlight of the second quarter was the FDA approval in July of our therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic that identifies EGFR in mutation-positive patients with non-small cell lung cancer eligible for treatment of Gilotrif from Boehringer Ingelheim. Our EGFR test has a highly competitive profile, covering more mutations than the other FDA-approved tests, including the most prominent resistance mutation, T790M. With this approval, we now offer regulated assays for the 2 big biomarkers, KRAS and RGQ [ph] in the 3 largest markets of the United States, Europe and Japan and many more such markets on the pipeline. Our portfolio of biomarkers goes far beyond KRAS and RGQ [ph] that is reflected in the slide. It shows the depths of the QIAGEN's biological content available for use in the Rotor-Gene Q with realtime PCR pyrosequencing, and in the future with the GeneReader benchtop NGS workflow. No one else in the industry can offer this type of breadth and depth of content and across so many different technology platforms and all with the unique system tied together with the most advanced biological data interpretation with Ingenuity. Here, we see that we have therascreen biomarkers, and these are primarily for solid tumors while the ipsogen portfolio biomarkers marks hematological disorders and a GeneRead of portfolio of genome panels for next-gen sequencing implications is set to expand into 20 from the current 9G [ph] panels. It is this portfolio biological content along with a range of technologies that give us the competitive advantage to be the leader in Personalized Healthcare, a position that we intend to expand with more biological content and new pharma collaborations. We are advancing our portfolio of more than 15 co-development projects with pharmaceutical companies, and we'll be gaining more insights into the next wave of filings as the year progresses. Now I'd like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. I'm now on Slide 17 to review our guidance for the third quarter and full year 2013. We have reaffirmed full year guidance for adjusted net sales growth of about 5% constant exchange rate wise. This include about 1 percentage point from AmniSure being treated as an acquisition through May 2013 and also about 1 percentage point from Ingenuity, which had sales of about USD 20 million in 2012 and is expected to provide about $15 million of revenues on a non-GAAP basis to QIAGEN in 2013. For adjusted diluted EPS, our guidance remains about $1.13 per share. Our guidance for the third quarter of 2013 is for adjusted net sales growth of about 6% constant exchange rate wise with about 2 percentage points from Ingenuity and 4 percentage points from the rest of the portfolio and for adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $0.27. As we have been saying, we are expecting higher year-on-year growth rate in the second half. Pharma, Academia and Applied Testing are expected to show improved results in part due to comparison against the second half of 2012. The Molecular Diagnostics growth drivers are set to keep expanding as well. This slide also contains assumption for adjusted -- adjustments for the third quarter and for full year, but before going through this, I would like to make reference to the changes announced in our press release last night in terms of the presentations of adjusted results in 2014. As of January 1, 2014, share-based compensation will be included as a cost in adjusted results. Information on share-based compensation will continue to be disclosed in QIAGEN's regulatory filings and annual reports. Also starting next year, in light of the completion of the efficiency project in 2014, cost restructuring activities will only be adjusted for business integration and acquisition-related M&A activities. We will continue to adjust volatization [ph] of our client intellectual property. So now for the adjustment for the third quarter, we expect share-based compensation of about USD 8 million, about USD 29 million for amortization of acquired intellectual property, about USD 20 million for business integration acquisition and restructuring items on the pretax operating income. For the third quarter, we expect approximately USD 5 million for business integration and acquisition-related costs and $15 million for restructuring. We also expect a similar split in the fourth quarter. As for adjusted tax rate, this is expected to be about 19% and this compares with a sequential tax rate of 23% in the second quarter of 2013. For the full year, we expect share-based compensation of about USD 33 million to USD 35 million, about $115 million for amortization of acquired intellectual property and then about $130 million to $135 million for business integration acquisition and restructuring as we complete the efficiency project. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be about 19% to 21%, which compares to 21% in 2012. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 18 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. Our results show the ability of QIAGEN to grow in challenging conditions. We are making progress on our initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth and have reaffirmed our plans to deliver improved sales and earnings for the year. This commitment to improving sales growth is accompanied by a focus on improving earnings and cash flow as well, and we want to see the benefits emerge from the major efficiency project that we have just completed. This conviction is shown in our decision to launch a new $100 million share repurchase program. Let me review again what we have announced. We achieved our targets for the second quarter in terms of sales and adjusted earnings growth. The FDA approval of our therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic kit compared with a breakthrough medicine for lung cancer patient is a key step in strengthening our Personalized Healthcare leadership, being backed by the deepest and broadest portfolio of content. Our next-generation sequencing initiative is moving ahead towards a phase customer launch later in 2013. Customer feedback and the acquisition of Ingenuity confirms our conviction that integrating gold standard for biological data interpretation will be a crucial differentiator in offering a complete and highest-quality NGS workflow. We are also nearing the milestone of 1,000 unit of placements of QIAsymphony. And we have also completed a major efficiency projects with a final group of initiatives, we are convinced that this project will put QIAGEN in a far better position today and we are determined to show the benefits through faster and higher value growth. In closing, we are delivering innovation and growth during 2013 even in a challenging environment and proactively addressing these market dynamics to leverage our leadership across all customer classes. With that, I'd like to hand back to the operator to open up the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] . Peer M. Schatz Operator, do we have a problem with the queue? Operator Excuse me, Vamil Divan? Vamil Divan - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division My question relates to EGFR, and the percent [indiscernible] you talked about there.How should we just think about the uptake because that test now there's a [indiscernible] in U.S. as compared with your success, what seems like good success you've had with KRAS. I mean, more generally, now that you have approval of these 2 companion diagnostics, how is that impacting sort of instrument demand in the U.S.? If you could just kind of touch on that... Peer M. Schatz KRAS experience, well, that would be a very important one. First, it allowed us to create a broad availability of our platform technology in our pathology labs. And clearly, this is something that will benefit the therascreen EGFR uptake due to the fact that the instruments are available now in those labs. And the workflows are well understood in training now [ph]. So that should be a significant benefit. The KRAS experience was also an interesting one because during the KRAS adoption, we had turbulences in the reimbursement landscape. And they, to a certain degree, are still here, but they're starting to clear. So the therascreen KRAS experience will definitely serve as a good template for EGFR. With KRAS, we've been able to achieve a very significant adoption. We are -- we, very quickly, went to 50%, 60% market share and are moving higher on that. And people are now appreciating that the investments that they made in the platforms can now be amortized over not only KRAS, but now also EGFR. It is exactly the same customer who does the EGFR testing compared to the KRAS testing. So from that perspective, we expect a good uptake. We already have a good share in the research applications, and we will make sure that, that converts also now to the clinical diagnostic application for EGFR, going forward, especially due to the fact -- and this was very, very helpful -- and a big benefit for us is that we have such a wide range of mutations that were analytically or even clinically validated and part of the label as well. This is a big differentiator and a big value proposition for our pathology customers because they can call out specific mutations that are of value. Vamil Divan - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more, just a follow-up on related. On the gross margin line, I appreciate the comments you guys made there, on the quarter, on the first half. Can you provide just a little more color on how to think about that? The gross margins for the third quarter and/or the second half, it did come in a little lower than we were expecting this quarter. Peer M. Schatz Yes, I could take that. We do believe that actually, the trend in the second quarter was quite positive also in terms of margin for QIAGEN. And of course, margins, too, can be directed by 2 factors on one side is our HPV franchise and the second factor is clearly, we are very successful in placing QIAsymphony [indiscernible]. We are trend QIAGEN programs, which clearly leads to incremental increase in depreciation. So those are the 2 biggest factors, going forward, I do believe our gross margin is an area where we are today is what we are going to expect. Operator The next question is from Tycho Peterson. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division First, just on TB, wondering if you can talk about maybe some of the competitive dynamics there for QuantiFERON, both with the receptive, getting a little bit more vocal with [indiscernible] TB -- at Oxford making a little bit more of a push in the U.S Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, the QuantiFERON-TB sales are doing very well, and we expect that to continue for quite some time. The competitive dynamics in the latent TB area, which is the one that QuantiFERON addresses is -- there's one small competitor that you mentioned that is primarly selling through a lab service. The process is extremely complicated and difficult to replicate and this is why it has not achieved broad adoption and that is to do with the way the technology or the way the diagnostic is set up in terms of use of specific technologies. So from that perspective, we have a very good position and remember the IP position that we have or the value proposition of QuantiFERON is the way that it is -- the technology is configured in a very easy process. The active TB noise that has been coming up is one that I was quite surprised about. The active TB market in the United States is not really very big. It is very big outside the United States and in emerging countries and in developing countries. In the United States, we've been monitoring it. There are some pockets of testing that are quite interesting. But definitely, any noise around TB, it is a very, very important disease to manage for the public health systems. Any noise around TB as a disease is very helpful for also bringing our message across that the best protection in the United States or other developed countries is active latent TB monitoring to contain or manage the disease. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And then, just to follow up on the trending in the back half of the year, you've had a number of questions today about kind of the assumptions around the acceleration that you're talking about. How much of that is just the function of easy comps versus maybe Pharma hitting a little better or other dynamics? Peer M. Schatz We're still quite cautious and particularly, in our Academia, where the budget cycle is now starting. We obviously had a very difficult second half last year in Academia as we went into continued with resolutions and the questions on the sequestration emerged. Now the market has gotten a little bit more used to it, so we are constantly optimistic on a rather stable situation for now. In Pharma, it was -- the [indiscernible are quite choppy so there is a quarter where we see significant ups and then a quarter significant downs. So this have to do with the site closings or big purchase programs, or big clinical trials that we are participating in, so it is a little bit more difficult to predict on a quarter. In the second half of the year, we think that the trends are intact. And you're absolutely right, there are some significant year-over-year effects that are impacting the top line sales growth through the second half of the year. So I would call it maybe 50-50, base effect versus also a continuation of the trends that we are currently seeing. If you did the math this way, we now have a little bit more than 48-point-something-percent of sales for the first half of this year and this is pretty similar to what we had last year. Operator Next question is from Mr. Daniel Wendorff. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division One to start with on your next-generation sequencing initiative. I appreciate that you spent that much time on explaining how Ingenuity went to your whole product offering. And what I would be interested to know again, what makes your product offering unique. And then also what could be sort of late contribution in the first year and on the other market of the major products, which I assume, are already [ph] in 2014 that, that would be my first question. And as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the QIAGENs new placement 15% in Q2 and that's consumables growing double digits in Q2. Can you potentially comment on the average current average consumable revenues per machine per year? That would be helpful. Peer M. Schatz Dan [indiscernible] take the second question [indiscernible]. So the first is, Dan, I hope you appreciate I won't give you sales speech for NGS. I'd be happy to give you one in a few months. But at this point in time, we -- clearly, this is a very emotionally charged market and one where there are significant opportunities. We feel very confident that we have a very, very competitive offering. We're targeting towards a niche, so we're not going into the overall market of next-gen sequencing. There's some very good and also successful players in this area, and they're doing a good job. Our focus in this area is to integrate into a sample-to-result workflow, meaning not sampling purified nucleic acid, but really a sample meaning a block of FSP. And then a fully automated workflow, you create a sample to interpreted results experience. And this is quite unique in the way the solution is designed. It also allows a very high throughput of samples, which is important in clinical research and diagnostics. So we have a number of benefits. We are also not leveraging a technology philosophy that's completely unknown, very well established and high-performance technology that we're using, our approach we're using is sequencing by synthesis with our own improvements. And this is something that we will get further details on in a few months, most likely around AMP. So I'll start giving you a sales pitch later this year -- at some point, would love to walking you through our customer list. Do you want to have... Roland Sackers Yes, absolutely. The QIAsymphony, I think there is -- just had good news around symphony. The one good news is that there are still a huge demand for symphony out of the other very good one, placing the instruments in the field and as said, even allows where we have a very strong performance. The second, of course, also in consumables portfolio is a very good double-digit growth this year. And you have to factor in one thing, which is important to realize, is it's important to understand, of course, if you have an increasing number of placements, that's clearly, actually, in the first 12 months. It's required a certain ramp-up phase in consumables and adoption of instrument. Despite that fact, we have seen now and why it's in terms of consumables and $60,000 [ph] and not as high as $80,000 [ph]. Our top customers are now very nice and north of [indiscernible] consumables per year. So I would say a very nice improvement in terms of growth and instrumentation placements, as well as consumable portfolio and of course, more opportunities are coming up with increasing our portfolio or on this year. It's we clearly one of the growth drivers of QIAGEN and it's clearly something I think we all have to realize there's not we have set on different growth drivers. It is on one side is the QIAsymphony, it is our health care franchise. It is our latent tuberculosis franchise. It is a performance in emerging markets so rather a set of different drivers for the second part of the 2013 and also for 2014, which should help us in accelerating the growth. But it's not down to 1 topic. It's pretty 5 [ph] , 6 [ph], different CapEx, which are helping us go into the right direction. Operator Your next question is from Mr. Vijay Kumar. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division So Peer, I wanted to dig in a little bit on Ingenuity. You have really positive feedback at ASTC. It feels like for the lab directors, for those who are trying into the next-gen sequencing, the utility of Ingenuity was unmatched. [indiscernible] The data was really sort of shared by lab directors. And my question is how do you plan to monetize Ingenuity for the special customer class, I guess? Has anything changed your view on the growth rates? Or any color you can provide would be helpful. Peer M. Schatz You're absolutely right. This solution is starting to emerge as a very clear leader in the diagnostics field as well. And there are multiple placements or many placements across the industry, including some large ones, also announced with large reference labs. The value proposition, several fold -- first of all, we're happy to support any customer using any platform and certainly on the interpretation side because this is something that we can generate value for us but also for the customer. At the same time, we think there's a value proposition in having a perfect integration where the content is, the assays, for instance, are perfectly aligned in terms of their workflows and also with the subsequent interpretation, which in some cases is still a transfer or is some sort of a translation into interpretation-ready format. So having those in the push button integration basically, 1 click from a sample to interpretive results processing is very helpful. You see some of our first panels now emerge already with integrated, also vouchers and access to the interpretation using these resources for customers who don't want to just look at the standard mutations and get those reported out on, they are part of the standard package. But to actually then look and scan the databases for potential other findings that the sequence results gave on the panels themselves. So even on small things like that, we're getting very, very nice uptake and that is increasing the value proposition of our overall workflow, including the assays. As we've said in spring, for us, the integration of Ingenuity is not about the workflow. It's not about the business model that that company had in the past. It's about integrating that value proposition into our assays, into our workflows, into our instruments and into our whole ecosystem. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Great. So maybe just one quick one for Roland. Could you just remind what the stock compensation assumptions are for the year roughly, Roland? Roland Sackers Sure. You will actually find in an attachment of our -- in the appendix of our slides. But we took -- we have a very constant number, so what we had seen in the second quarter is also what you're expecting in the third and fourth quarter as well. Operator The next question is from Mr. Doug Schenkel. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I guess one -- sorry to keep harping on Ingenuity. But it's really great to hear how enthused you are about the product. And it's interesting to hear you all just talk about how important it could been in clinical applications. I guess the one thing I'd like to hear a little bit more about is in talking to Ingenuity a number of times over the years, including just before your acquisition of the company, we heard about Ingenuity having a product in the pipeline that's very similar to Variant Analysis, targeted specifically at clinical applications. However, Ingenuity and industry consultants believe that the regulatory pathway for this product would be at best a bit unclear for the foreseeable future. Most of Ingenuity sales as you've talked about the prepared remarks have been historically to biopharma and, to some degree, over recent quarters increasingly to academic researchers. How are you guys thinking about the regulatory pathway for Ingenuity in clinical applications? And given that these applications account for a small but growing percentage of Ingenuity sales today, how do you expect the overall sales mix of Ingenuity to evolve over the next year or so? Peer M. Schatz Well, I think there are 3 answers to that. First is there's -- there are many different regulatory systems and we shouldn'y only focus on the United States. So in other countries of the world, there is a wide open pathway for the use of these tools and they represent almost half of the world's market or even maybe more. So that's something that we're definitely taking global on this. The second thing is, if you don't believe in the use of these tools, you don't believe in next-gen sequencing and diagnostics. And we all know that it's because that's essentially what you're doing, so if you're -- any diagnostic sequencing result, there is not a single FDA-approved product out there. And data is being reported out that currently is still far away from being in a format that is regulated. And there's also, there are a lot of question marks in terms of the regulatory pathway of next-generation sequencing overall, at least for these broader scans. So we are actively working with regulators and the power of the technology is just so convincing that it can be followed up with regulated tests. Exploratory scans can be done in research use mode. The question is, who reports what and under what Safe Harbor regulatory process is then the confirmation done. We heavily believe that the use of regulated realtime PCR kits will continue for quite a long time because that is a very, very established regulatory pathway. But we also see that there is synergy with next-gen sequencing. And that synergy, the link between the realtime PCR and the sequencing products is in the interpretation side, interpretation of broad masses of information, into potentially actual mutations that could be tested for using an FDA-approved product. So there's a certain sequence that people are looking at. But right now, the whole industry is in search for a regulatory pathway. We are in an intensive discussions, as I said, and we want to work with the agencies around the world to bring the power of this technology to not only pathologists but to patients. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I guess a guidance question for either you or Roland. So correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that your organic revenue guidance for both Q3 and Q4 is for about 4% to 5% growth. You talked about some academic improvement or at least stability versus easier comps. You've also talked about choppiness in Pharma. Pharma has been an area where you guys have been growing a little bit below the peer group the last few quarters. Is there some specific backlog to the Pharma end market that you expect to drive some notable growth behind the favorable comps in the second half? And if you talk about Japan's stimulus activity, I missed it, I'm just curious if you picked up some business there maybe at the end of Q2 that's going to help you in the second half. And also this LDT reimbursement issue, are you expecting that to be less of an issue in the second half? Peer M. Schatz Well, the number of things that I would point to is impacts, and Roland if you could maybe prepare the year-over-year numbers and also sequential additions. But as I said before, there are base effects, which are about half of that, that the other half is a continuation of trends similar to what we saw the third quarter. So we're not expecting manna from heaven, we're not expecting magical jumps anyway. If you look at the math, there is a pathway in front of us, which is pretty similar to what we saw last year. You're right, Pharma has been choppy. I would debate that it was below the peer group. If you remember, we were high-single digits last year in growth. I don't -- didn't see that with anybody. The first quarter was very weak. The second quarter was now a little bit better. It is, as an overall group, it's a little bit difficult to predict. We think we have some predictability now into the fourth quarter and are assuming a very modest growth rate for Pharma. But also here, the year-over-year is more difficult in Pharma, it's much easier in Academia. On the net, it's actually a favorable base comparison. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes, I think, for a while. The answer to your question [indiscernible]. So far something in Q2, so it clearly is a step-up. Something is going to happen in the second or fourth quarter, but I would remark on what was said before. We're actually in quite a similar pattern as last year in terms of allocation. First half to next year, so we're actually see that we are well on track also in terms of performance from Q1 to Q2. We have seen in all customer segments an improvement. And if we look into Q3, a lot of growth drivers are coming off into an impact. We talked about two-year [ph] ARPU. We talked about the QIAsymphony placements doing well. We talked about the consumers are growing quite nicely. We clearly have seen a very nice improvement also around the QuantiFERON-TB business. And the only nonorganic one for the rest of the year is Ingenuity, and we clearly laid out the number here as well. So clearly, a lot of different reasons to coming together here. So again, as always business is a challenge. But I would say it's no different than what we have seen last year so... Operator The next question is from Mr. Derik De Bruin. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So if you look at the margin outlook over the next couple of years, you obviously have taken a lot of the restructuring actions. You've got mixed changes. You've got acquisitions coming in. You've got pricing going all over the place. I guess how do we think about where -- what do you go from its 27%, 28% adjusted operating margin this year to -- are you in for a transition year as you sort of launch out the sequencing stuff? What -- when we sort of look at '15 and '16, what do we think about in the margin trajectory? Peer M. Schatz Roland? Roland Sackers Yes, sure. I would say we see similar performance in terms of margin development that we expect for this year. Please bear in mind that this year's margins, margins got the diluted by 100 basis points because of the Ingenuity acquisition as we laid out when we announced the acquisition despite the fact that we are probably able to margin already this year. We clearly did a lot around restructuring efforts, so it's clearly also something where we believe that we should expect certain acceleration out of that. So general, things are moving in the right direction. We still believe our midterm goal of 100 basis points. EBIT margin improvement is what we are looking for. Nevertheless, seeing all the initiatives also on the top line on the midterm, that this should be account of something that we should reach quite nicely. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Great. And then just one quick follow-up on that one. I guess, what are you sort of looking for x U.S. HPV screen growth? Is it something that was double-digits? Roland Sackers No. On x U.S., we moved a little bit to -- why I'm talking about it because a lot of this business is pent-up business, and we want to talk about is [indiscernible] business here. And as you see now, we did, for example, this quarter, on our China franchise. It's really something where we don't want to create too much expectations right now because sometimes this takes longer than you internally predict. Nevertheless, in terms of market share and winning tenders, we still have a good track record here. So a couple of tenders out in Europe, as well as in emerging markets, and we will report about it once we won them. Peer M. Schatz I think that -- just to add on to that, we're winning almost every time in this area as well. And the recent data, especially from a large population-based screening, a study in Denmark came out dismal for some of our competitors, and very strong for us. And this has clearly made the power of our technology very clear for these population-based screening tenders. So while they're happening on a regional basis kind of continuing, we're winning a lot of them. But in terms of growth, it is not a high-growth because most of the countries are still on [indiscernible] very limited post-screening regionally. Operator The next question is from Mr. Bill Quirk. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Just wanted to follow up here. Your thoughts a little bit about reimbursement on couple of different occasions, plus a call for an earlier question. In 2Q, in the States, anyway, has become quite a problem for a number of companies, both small and large. And so I'd be curious -- it doesn't really affect some of your infectious disease products, but obviously, for the Personalized Healthcare. Maybe some of your practices where you have some overlap on genetic analysis. How should we be thinking about that? I guess have you thought about that in terms of the back-half guidance? Peer M. Schatz Sure, Bill, good question. No, there's definitely been a lot of turbulence in the reimbursement landscape in the first half of the year. The largest focus that we have in our own reimbursement effort, we've been, on the hill at least, 50x, 60x in last 6 months in various formats and we've been actively lobbying for there fairer reimbursement rates for both LDTs and also FDA-approved kits. Some of our labs are truly suffering, and we're doing everything we can to support that. Now when the reimbursement rates for LDTs came out in January, clearly that was little bit a shocker for everybody. At the same time, a few weeks later, we were informed that there would be a premium reimbursement rate for FDA-approved kits. And the KRAS reimbursement rate came out that $385, substantially, above where we had the average on the quote stacking. And this has been very favorable for customers who have run the math. Because the difference between the LDT and the FDA reimbursement rate is actually about the price per reportable. And so it is actually economically favorable to use the FDA-approved kit for laboratory compared to the LDT. Nevertheless, the base rate, the LDT rate, is just too low. And there's no question about it. And we're trying to raise that. So we are providing some additional value drivers for our laboratory customers and same will hopefully be true for each follower, where reimbursements rates are going to be sent in the next few weeks. But nevertheless, these differential reimbursements have not yet broadened through the United States. They started only in certain regions or certain coverage areas, and we expect them to go broader. Currently, a lot of laboratories are not getting these premium reimbursement rates, so it has been very difficult to adopt and to accelerate. But this is a something, I think, which is more a matter of time. And to make long things short, we have a very interesting value proposition for laboratories by going through these very, very expensive FDA approval processes. At the same time, laboratories are currently suffering because premium reimbursement rates for FDA-approved products are not available and a lot of them are LDTs, which are not very attractive. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Just to sum it up, would you expect reimbursements sort of the headwinds that you've seen to continue to dissipate here? And I guess the question is not just CMS but managed care as well. And then follow-up question is just on sequencing. Is it reasonable to assume that we should start to get some stats at meeting in the fall or back half of the year? Something like an [indiscernible], Peer M. Schatz Yes. You're absolutely right that we offer a value for our customers. So the reimbursement rates, we're able to secure for our assays, will give us tailwind or is giving us a tailwind to move into the laboratory because it's economically a lot more attractive to work with a therascreen KRAS kit, for instance, than it is to do an LDT. So this is giving us the benefit, and we have the only approved KRAS test and we have the best EGFR test out there. And this is something that should be a benefit to us. But again, we are feeling for our customers and are actively working with them because we also have an interest in LDTs as well. In terms of the NGS disclosure, yes, we will start providing more information later this year. We should see [ph] potentially AMP with the -- if you decide to do that and increasingly then build the information base over the next few months. Operator Your next question is from Mr. Matthew Shaer [ph]. Unknown Analyst If we are looking at the initial results, I was wondering actually what makes you very confident to reset the guidance and what could be your biggest fear in terms of all the issue and just as quick follow-up on the PHG [ph] franchise. We saw some lower [indiscernible] revenues in Q2. I was wondering if you could give us some comments on that for the rest of the year, and as well as the RGQ [ph] you signed this quarter? Peer M. Schatz I'll take the second one. Roland, if you could take the first one. Roland Sackers Sure, then I'll start. Yes, it's hard to say that earlier, we do believe that the ramp-up from Q1 to Q2 is quite promising because [indiscernible] to remain our customer segments. We clearly do believe that Academia is continuing to be a challenging environment. Nevertheless, it improved a bit compared to the first quarter and as Peer said before, we are still to see what happening now especially in the U.S. by end of the year, but I would say that it's still too early to speculate. In all other areas, our growth drivers are very well on track. We see that our latent tuberculosis franchise is on track. We see that our QuantiFERON franchise is doing very well. We see television consumer growth rate in Applied Testing. We are seeing good growth rates in the emerging markets. So there's a lot of different reasons why we believe that things are moving in the right direction. In a very difficult environment, I think we have to understand as well. Therefore, we also kept the guidance as it is, and we see so far on track by delivering that. And again, we are going to update U.S. as the year proceeds. But so far, I would say we study better than we thought we are. We were able to close our restructuring efforts in the second quarter of 2013, which is an important milestone that is probably not seen much from the outside. But certainly, of course, it gets us more focused and again, very clearly out for the next couple of years. So I would say also, the structure is well in place. Peer M. Schatz And Matthew, to the first question, the project milestones are typically related to the development milestones that we have with Pharma Partners, so we basically conduct a development, reach a certain milestone that could be a validation milestone or a regulatory milestone and we then write an invoice and recognize the revenue. And that can be lumpy, and this is not the majority of our actually for the minority of sales in this space. But is one that can go up to $1 million down to a few million. We are signing is a lot of the new partnerships, and this year has been very good. We've been filling the pipeline for the next few years very well. And however, we have decided not to announce most of the deals that we do because clearly, some of our former partners have pipeline attrition risks that they want to make sure that they manage correctly. Also in terms of the public information, so a lot of this is still confidential wherever possible, we are -- we discuss if we can or should release some information on it. We're trying to take this a lot closer now to market introduction. But the interesting thing is we are not only in cancer and we're also in other UNTS [ph] and other diseases as well, and have a broad set of a biomarkers, both QIAGEN proprietary but also partner proprietary assays that are being added to the portfolio. So the list I gave you in the presentation is really only what we have publicly available in the shelf. If you would it take the pipeline, it would be much bigger. John Gilardi So with that, we'd like to close the conference call, and thank you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me and we look forward to talking to you. Thank you very much.

Schatz Operator, do we have a problem with the queue? Operator Excuse me, Vamil Divan? Vamil Divan - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division My question relates to EGFR, and the percent [indiscernible] you talked about there.How should we just think about the uptake because that test now there's a [indiscernible] in U.S. as compared with your success, what seems like good success you've had with KRAS. I mean, more generally, now that you have approval of these 2 companion diagnostics, how is that impacting sort of instrument demand in the U.S.? If you could just kind of touch on that... Peer M. Schatz KRAS experience, well, that would be a very important one. First, it allowed us to create a broad availability of our platform technology in our pathology labs. And clearly, this is something that will benefit the therascreen EGFR uptake due to the fact that the instruments are available now in those labs. And the workflows are well understood in training now [ph]. So that should be a significant benefit. The KRAS experience was also an interesting one because during the KRAS adoption, we had turbulences in the reimbursement landscape. And they, to a certain degree, are still here, but they're starting to clear. So the therascreen KRAS experience will definitely serve as a good template for EGFR. With KRAS, we've been able to achieve a very significant adoption. We are -- we, very quickly, went to 50%, 60% market share and are moving higher on that. And people are now appreciating that the investments that they made in the platforms can now be amortized over not only KRAS, but now also EGFR. It is exactly the same customer who does the EGFR testing compared to the KRAS testing. So from that perspective, we expect a good uptake. We already have a good share in the research applications, and we will make sure that, that converts also now to the clinical diagnostic application for EGFR, going forward, especially due to the fact -- and this was very, very helpful -- and a big benefit for us is that we have such a wide range of mutations that were analytically or even clinically validated and part of the label as well. This is a big differentiator and a big value proposition for our pathology customers because they can call out specific mutations that are of value. Vamil Divan - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Okay. If I could just squeeze in one more, just a follow-up on related. On the gross margin line, I appreciate the comments you guys made there, on the quarter, on the first half. Can you provide just a little more color on how to think about that? The gross margins for the third quarter and/or the second half, it did come in a little lower than we were expecting this quarter. Peer M. Schatz Yes, I could take that. We do believe that actually, the trend in the second quarter was quite positive also in terms of margin for QIAGEN. And of course, margins, too, can be directed by 2 factors on one side is our HPV franchise and the second factor is clearly, we are very successful in placing QIAsymphony [indiscernible]. We are trend QIAGEN programs, which clearly leads to incremental increase in depreciation. So those are the 2 biggest factors, going forward, I do believe our gross margin is an area where we are today is what we are going to expect. Operator The next question is from Tycho Peterson. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division First, just on TB, wondering if you can talk about maybe some of the competitive dynamics there for QuantiFERON, both with the receptive, getting a little bit more vocal with [indiscernible] TB -- at Oxford making a little bit more of a push in the U.S Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, the QuantiFERON-TB sales are doing very well, and we expect that to continue for quite some time. The competitive dynamics in the latent TB area, which is the one that QuantiFERON addresses is -- there's one small competitor that you mentioned that is primarly selling through a lab service. The process is extremely complicated and difficult to replicate and this is why it has not achieved broad adoption and that is to do with the way the technology or the way the diagnostic is set up in terms of use of specific technologies. So from that perspective, we have a very good position and remember the IP position that we have or the value proposition of QuantiFERON is the way that it is -- the technology is configured in a very easy process. The active TB noise that has been coming up is one that I was quite surprised about. The active TB market in the United States is not really very big. It is very big outside the United States and in emerging countries and in developing countries. In the United States, we've been monitoring it. There are some pockets of testing that are quite interesting. But definitely, any noise around TB, it is a very, very important disease to manage for the public health systems. Any noise around TB as a disease is very helpful for also bringing our message across that the best protection in the United States or other developed countries is active latent TB monitoring to contain or manage the disease. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And then, just to follow up on the trending in the back half of the year, you've had a number of questions today about kind of the assumptions around the acceleration that you're talking about. How much of that is just the function of easy comps versus maybe Pharma hitting a little better or other dynamics? Peer M. Schatz We're still quite cautious and particularly, in our Academia, where the budget cycle is now starting. We obviously had a very difficult second half last year in Academia as we went into continued with resolutions and the questions on the sequestration emerged. Now the market has gotten a little bit more used to it, so we are constantly optimistic on a rather stable situation for now. In Pharma, it was -- the [indiscernible are quite choppy so there is a quarter where we see significant ups and then a quarter significant downs. So this have to do with the site closings or big purchase programs, or big clinical trials that we are participating in, so it is a little bit more difficult to predict on a quarter. In the second half of the year, we think that the trends are intact. And you're absolutely right, there are some significant year-over-year effects that are impacting the top line sales growth through the second half of the year. So I would call it maybe 50-50, base effect versus also a continuation of the trends that we are currently seeing. If you did the math this way, we now have a little bit more than 48-point-something-percent of sales for the first half of this year and this is pretty similar to what we had last year. Operator Next question is from Mr. Daniel Wendorff. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division One to start with on your next-generation sequencing initiative. I appreciate that you spent that much time on explaining how Ingenuity went to your whole product offering. And what I would be interested to know again, what makes your product offering unique. And then also what could be sort of late contribution in the first year and on the other market of the major products, which I assume, are already [ph] in 2014 that, that would be my first question. And as a follow-up question, you mentioned that the QIAGENs new placement 15% in Q2 and that's consumables growing double digits in Q2. Can you potentially comment on the average current average consumable revenues per machine per year? That would be helpful. Peer M. Schatz Dan [indiscernible] take the second question [indiscernible]. So the first is, Dan, I hope you appreciate I won't give you sales speech for NGS. I'd be happy to give you one in a few months. But at this point in time, we -- clearly, this is a very emotionally charged market and one where there are significant opportunities. We feel very confident that we have a very, very competitive offering. We're targeting towards a niche, so we're not going into the overall market of next-gen sequencing. There's some very good and also successful players in this area, and they're doing a good job. Our focus in this area is to integrate into a sample-to-result workflow, meaning not sampling purified nucleic acid, but really a sample meaning a block of FSP. And then a fully automated workflow, you create a sample to interpreted results experience. And this is quite unique in the way the solution is designed. It also allows a very high throughput of samples, which is important in clinical research and diagnostics. So we have a number of benefits. We are also not leveraging a technology philosophy that's completely unknown, very well established and high-performance technology that we're using, our approach we're using is sequencing by synthesis with our own improvements. And this is something that we will get further details on in a few months, most likely around AMP. So I'll start giving you a sales pitch later this year -- at some point, would love to walking you through our customer list. Do you want to have... Roland Sackers Yes, absolutely. The QIAsymphony, I think there is -- just had good news around symphony. The one good news is that there are still a huge demand for symphony out of the other very good one, placing the instruments in the field and as said, even allows where we have a very strong performance. The second, of course, also in consumables portfolio is a very good double-digit growth this year. And you have to factor in one thing, which is important to realize, is it's important to understand, of course, if you have an increasing number of placements, that's clearly, actually, in the first 12 months. It's required a certain ramp-up phase in consumables and adoption of instrument. Despite that fact, we have seen now and why it's in terms of consumables and $60,000 [ph] and not as high as $80,000 [ph]. Our top customers are now very nice and north of [indiscernible] consumables per year. So I would say a very nice improvement in terms of growth and instrumentation placements, as well as consumable portfolio and of course, more opportunities are coming up with increasing our portfolio or on this year. It's we clearly one of the growth drivers of QIAGEN and it's clearly something I think we all have to realize there's not we have set on different growth drivers. It is on one side is the QIAsymphony, it is our health care franchise. It is our latent tuberculosis franchise. It is a performance in emerging markets so rather a set of different drivers for the second part of the 2013 and also for 2014, which should help us in accelerating the growth. But it's not down to 1 topic. It's pretty 5 [ph] , 6 [ph], different CapEx, which are helping us go into the right direction. Operator Your next question is from Mr. Vijay Kumar. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division So Peer, I wanted to dig in a little bit on Ingenuity. You have really positive feedback at ASTC. It feels like for the lab directors, for those who are trying into the next-gen sequencing, the utility of Ingenuity was unmatched. [indiscernible] The data was really sort of shared by lab directors. And my question is how do you plan to monetize Ingenuity for the special customer class, I guess? Has anything changed your view on the growth rates? Or any color you can provide would be helpful. Peer M. Schatz You're absolutely right. This solution is starting to emerge as a very clear leader in the diagnostics field as well. And there are multiple placements or many placements across the industry, including some large ones, also announced with large reference labs. The value proposition, several fold -- first of all, we're happy to support any customer using any platform and certainly on the interpretation side because this is something that we can generate value for us but also for the customer. At the same time, we think there's a value proposition in having a perfect integration where the content is, the assays, for instance, are perfectly aligned in terms of their workflows and also with the subsequent interpretation, which in some cases is still a transfer or is some sort of a translation into interpretation-ready format. So having those in the push button integration basically, 1 click from a sample to interpretive results processing is very helpful. You see some of our first panels now emerge already with integrated, also vouchers and access to the interpretation using these resources for customers who don't want to just look at the standard mutations and get those reported out on, they are part of the standard package. But to actually then look and scan the databases for potential other findings that the sequence results gave on the panels themselves. So even on small things like that, we're getting very, very nice uptake and that is increasing the value proposition of our overall workflow, including the assays. As we've said in spring, for us, the integration of Ingenuity is not about the workflow. It's not about the business model that that company had in the past. It's about integrating that value proposition into our assays, into our workflows, into our instruments and into our whole ecosystem. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Great. So maybe just one quick one for Roland. Could you just remind what the stock compensation assumptions are for the year roughly, Roland? Roland Sackers Sure. You will actually find in an attachment of our -- in the appendix of our slides. But we took -- we have a very constant number, so what we had seen in the second quarter is also what you're expecting in the third and fourth quarter as well. Operator The next question is from Mr. Doug Schenkel. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I guess one -- sorry to keep harping on Ingenuity. But it's really great to hear how enthused you are about the product. And it's interesting to hear you all just talk about how important it could been in clinical applications. I guess the one thing I'd like to hear a little bit more about is in talking to Ingenuity a number of times over the years, including just before your acquisition of the company, we heard about Ingenuity having a product in the pipeline that's very similar to Variant Analysis, targeted specifically at clinical applications. However, Ingenuity and industry consultants believe that the regulatory pathway for this product would be at best a bit unclear for the foreseeable future. Most of Ingenuity sales as you've talked about the prepared remarks have been historically to biopharma and, to some degree, over recent quarters increasingly to academic researchers. How are you guys thinking about the regulatory pathway for Ingenuity in clinical applications? And given that these applications account for a small but growing percentage of Ingenuity sales today, how do you expect the overall sales mix of Ingenuity to evolve over the next year or so? Peer M. Schatz Well, I think there are 3 answers to that. First is there's -- there are many different regulatory systems and we shouldn'y only focus on the United States. So in other countries of the world, there is a wide open pathway for the use of these tools and they represent almost half of the world's market or even maybe more. So that's something that we're definitely taking global on this. The second thing is, if you don't believe in the use of these tools, you don't believe in next-gen sequencing and diagnostics. And we all know that it's because that's essentially what you're doing, so if you're -- any diagnostic sequencing result, there is not a single FDA-approved product out there. And data is being reported out that currently is still far away from being in a format that is regulated. And there's also, there are a lot of question marks in terms of the regulatory pathway of next-generation sequencing overall, at least for these broader scans. So we are actively working with regulators and the power of the technology is just so convincing that it can be followed up with regulated tests. Exploratory scans can be done in research use mode. The question is, who reports what and under what Safe Harbor regulatory process is then the confirmation done. We heavily believe that the use of regulated realtime PCR kits will continue for quite a long time because that is a very, very established regulatory pathway. But we also see that there is synergy with next-gen sequencing. And that synergy, the link between the realtime PCR and the sequencing products is in the interpretation side, interpretation of broad masses of information, into potentially actual mutations that could be tested for using an FDA-approved product. So there's a certain sequence that people are looking at. But right now, the whole industry is in search for a regulatory pathway. We are in an intensive discussions, as I said, and we want to work with the agencies around the world to bring the power of this technology to not only pathologists but to patients. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I guess a guidance question for either you or Roland. So correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that your organic revenue guidance for both Q3 and Q4 is for about 4% to 5% growth. You talked about some academic improvement or at least stability versus easier comps. You've also talked about choppiness in Pharma. Pharma has been an area where you guys have been growing a little bit below the peer group the last few quarters. Is there some specific backlog to the Pharma end market that you expect to drive some notable growth behind the favorable comps in the second half? And if you talk about Japan's stimulus activity, I missed it, I'm just curious if you picked up some business there maybe at the end of Q2 that's going to help you in the second half. And also this LDT reimbursement issue, are you expecting that to be less of an issue in the second half? Peer M. Schatz Well, the number of things that I would point to is impacts, and Roland if you could maybe prepare the year-over-year numbers and also sequential additions. But as I said before, there are base effects, which are about half of that, that the other half is a continuation of trends similar to what we saw the third quarter. So we're not expecting manna from heaven, we're not expecting magical jumps anyway. If you look at the math, there is a pathway in front of us, which is pretty similar to what we saw last year. You're right, Pharma has been choppy. I would debate that it was below the peer group. If you remember, we were high-single digits last year in growth. I don't -- didn't see that with anybody. The first quarter was very weak. The second quarter was now a little bit better. It is, as an overall group, it's a little bit difficult to predict. We think we have some predictability now into the fourth quarter and are assuming a very modest growth rate for Pharma. But also here, the year-over-year is more difficult in Pharma, it's much easier in Academia. On the net, it's actually a favorable base comparison. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes, I think, for a while. The answer to your question [indiscernible]. So far something in Q2, so it clearly is a step-up. Something is going to happen in the second or fourth quarter, but I would remark on what was said before. We're actually in quite a similar pattern as last year in terms of allocation. First half to next year, so we're actually see that we are well on track also in terms of performance from Q1 to Q2. We have seen in all customer segments an improvement. And if we look into Q3, a lot of growth drivers are coming off into an impact. We talked about two-year [ph] ARPU. We talked about the QIAsymphony placements doing well. We talked about the consumers are growing quite nicely. We clearly have seen a very nice improvement also around the QuantiFERON-TB business. And the only nonorganic one for the rest of the year is Ingenuity, and we clearly laid out the number here as well. So clearly, a lot of different reasons to coming together here. So again, as always business is a challenge. But I would say it's no different than what we have seen last year so... Operator The next question is from Mr. Derik De Bruin. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So if you look at the margin outlook over the next couple of years, you obviously have taken a lot of the restructuring actions. You've got mixed changes. You've got acquisitions coming in. You've got pricing going all over the place. I guess how do we think about where -- what do you go from its 27%, 28% adjusted operating margin this year to -- are you in for a transition year as you sort of launch out the sequencing stuff? What -- when we sort of look at '15 and '16, what do we think about in the margin trajectory? Peer M. Schatz Roland? Roland Sackers Yes, sure. I would say we see similar performance in terms of margin development that we expect for this year. Please bear in mind that this year's margins, margins got the diluted by 100 basis points because of the Ingenuity acquisition as we laid out when we announced the acquisition despite the fact that we are probably able to margin already this year. We clearly did a lot around restructuring efforts, so it's clearly also something where we believe that we should expect certain acceleration out of that. So general, things are moving in the right direction. We still believe our midterm goal of 100 basis points. EBIT margin improvement is what we are looking for. Nevertheless, seeing all the initiatives also on the top line on the midterm, that this should be account of something that we should reach quite nicely. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Great. And then just one quick follow-up on that one. I guess, what are you sort of looking for x U.S. HPV screen growth? Is it something that was double-digits? Roland Sackers No. On x U.S., we moved a little bit to -- why I'm talking about it because a lot of this business is pent-up business, and we want to talk about is [indiscernible] business here. And as you see now, we did, for example, this quarter, on our China franchise. It's really something where we don't want to create too much expectations right now because sometimes this takes longer than you internally predict. Nevertheless, in terms of market share and winning tenders, we still have a good track record here. So a couple of tenders out in Europe, as well as in emerging markets, and we will report about it once we won them. Peer M. Schatz I think that -- just to add on to that, we're winning almost every time in this area as well. And the recent data, especially from a large population-based screening, a study in Denmark came out dismal for some of our competitors, and very strong for us. And this has clearly made the power of our technology very clear for these population-based screening tenders. So while they're happening on a regional basis kind of continuing, we're winning a lot of them. But in terms of growth, it is not a high-growth because most of the countries are still on [indiscernible] very limited post-screening regionally. Operator The next question is from Mr. Bill Quirk. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Just wanted to follow up here. Your thoughts a little bit about reimbursement on couple of different occasions, plus a call for an earlier question. In 2Q, in the States, anyway, has become quite a problem for a number of companies, both small and large. And so I'd be curious -- it doesn't really affect some of your infectious disease products, but obviously, for the Personalized Healthcare. Maybe some of your practices where you have some overlap on genetic analysis. How should we be thinking about that? I guess have you thought about that in terms of the back-half guidance? Peer M. Schatz Sure, Bill, good question. No, there's definitely been a lot of turbulence in the reimbursement landscape in the first half of the year. The largest focus that we have in our own reimbursement effort, we've been, on the hill at least, 50x, 60x in last 6 months in various formats and we've been actively lobbying for there fairer reimbursement rates for both LDTs and also FDA-approved kits. Some of our labs are truly suffering, and we're doing everything we can to support that. Now when the reimbursement rates for LDTs came out in January, clearly that was little bit a shocker for everybody. At the same time, a few weeks later, we were informed that there would be a premium reimbursement rate for FDA-approved kits. And the KRAS reimbursement rate came out that $385, substantially, above where we had the average on the quote stacking. And this has been very favorable for customers who have run the math. Because the difference between the LDT and the FDA reimbursement rate is actually about the price per reportable. And so it is actually economically favorable to use the FDA-approved kit for laboratory compared to the LDT. Nevertheless, the base rate, the LDT rate, is just too low. And there's no question about it. And we're trying to raise that. So we are providing some additional value drivers for our laboratory customers and same will hopefully be true for each follower, where reimbursements rates are going to be sent in the next few weeks. But nevertheless, these differential reimbursements have not yet broadened through the United States. They started only in certain regions or certain coverage areas, and we expect them to go broader. Currently, a lot of laboratories are not getting these premium reimbursement rates, so it has been very difficult to adopt and to accelerate. But this is a something, I think, which is more a matter of time. And to make long things short, we have a very interesting value proposition for laboratories by going through these very, very expensive FDA approval processes. At the same time, laboratories are currently suffering because premium reimbursement rates for FDA-approved products are not available and a lot of them are LDTs, which are not very attractive. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Just to sum it up, would you expect reimbursements sort of the headwinds that you've seen to continue to dissipate here? And I guess the question is not just CMS but managed care as well. And then follow-up question is just on sequencing. Is it reasonable to assume that we should start to get some stats at meeting in the fall or back half of the year? Something like an [indiscernible], Peer M. Schatz Yes. You're absolutely right that we offer a value for our customers. So the reimbursement rates, we're able to secure for our assays, will give us tailwind or is giving us a tailwind to move into the laboratory because it's economically a lot more attractive to work with a therascreen KRAS kit, for instance, than it is to do an LDT. So this is giving us the benefit, and we have the only approved KRAS test and we have the best EGFR test out there. And this is something that should be a benefit to us. But again, we are feeling for our customers and are actively working with them because we also have an interest in LDTs as well. In terms of the NGS disclosure, yes, we will start providing more information later this year. We should see [ph] potentially AMP with the -- if you decide to do that and increasingly then build the information base over the next few months. Operator Your next question is from Mr. Matthew Shaer [ph]. Unknown Analyst If we are looking at the initial results, I was wondering actually what makes you very confident to reset the guidance and what could be your biggest fear in terms of all the issue and just as quick follow-up on the PHG [ph] franchise. We saw some lower [indiscernible] revenues in Q2. I was wondering if you could give us some comments on that for the rest of the year, and as well as the RGQ [ph] you signed this quarter? Peer M. Schatz I'll take the second one. Roland, if you could take the first one. Roland Sackers Sure, then I'll start. Yes, it's hard to say that earlier, we do believe that the ramp-up from Q1 to Q2 is quite promising because [indiscernible] to remain our customer segments. We clearly do believe that Academia is continuing to be a challenging environment. Nevertheless, it improved a bit compared to the first quarter and as Peer said before, we are still to see what happening now especially in the U.S. by end of the year, but I would say that it's still too early to speculate. In all other areas, our growth drivers are very well on track. We see that our latent tuberculosis franchise is on track. We see that our QuantiFERON franchise is doing very well. We see television consumer growth rate in Applied Testing. We are seeing good growth rates in the emerging markets. So there's a lot of different reasons why we believe that things are moving in the right direction. In a very difficult environment, I think we have to understand as well. Therefore, we also kept the guidance as it is, and we see so far on track by delivering that. And again, we are going to update U.S. as the year proceeds. But so far, I would say we study better than we thought we are. We were able to close our restructuring efforts in the second quarter of 2013, which is an important milestone that is probably not seen much from the outside. But certainly, of course, it gets us more focused and again, very clearly out for the next couple of years. So I would say also, the structure is well in place. Peer M. Schatz And Matthew, to the first question, the project milestones are typically related to the development milestones that we have with Pharma Partners, so we basically conduct a development, reach a certain milestone that could be a validation milestone or a regulatory milestone and we then write an invoice and recognize the revenue. And that can be lumpy, and this is not the majority of our actually for the minority of sales in this space. But is one that can go up to $1 million down to a few million. We are signing is a lot of the new partnerships, and this year has been very good. We've been filling the pipeline for the next few years very well. And however, we have decided not to announce most of the deals that we do because clearly, some of our former partners have pipeline attrition risks that they want to make sure that they manage correctly. Also in terms of the public information, so a lot of this is still confidential wherever possible, we are -- we discuss if we can or should release some information on it. We're trying to take this a lot closer now to market introduction. But the interesting thing is we are not only in cancer and we're also in other UNTS [ph] and other diseases as well, and have a broad set of a biomarkers, both QIAGEN proprietary but also partner proprietary assays that are being added to the portfolio. So the list I gave you in the presentation is really only what we have publicly available in the shelf. If you would it take the pipeline, it would be much bigger. John Gilardi So with that, we'd like to close the conference call, and thank you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact me and we look forward to talking to you. Thank you very much.

We look forward to your participation. I'd like to now hand over to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Thank you, John. Hello, and welcome to our third quarter conference call in which we will discuss our results and our progress on goals we set for 2013. We are pleased with our results for the quarter, having exceeded our communicated targets. Adjusted net sales were $323.8 million and grew 7% at constant exchange rates, which was ahead of our 6% target. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.28, and this was also ahead of our target for $0.27. We are focused on achieving our full year guidance despite the challenging macroeconomic conditions, and this target remains for adjusted sales growth of about 5% on a constant exchange rate basis and adjusted EPS of $1.13. The results of the first 9 months of the year show our progress in terms of adding value. We are extremely pleased to report that we recently broke through 1,000 cumulative installed systems for the QIAsymphony automation platform, and this is an important milestone for us in achieving the industry's fastest ever uptake of a molecular testing platform. The milestone was achieved ahead of our target. We see significant untapped opportunities ahead of us in terms of placements, and we also continue to see robust double-digit growth on consumables. The recent launch of a new QIAsymphony test in Europe, one for the detection of CT/NG or Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the last signal of our progress. In Personalized Healthcare, we have begun the U.S. rollout of our therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic kit after FDA approval in July. Reimbursement discussions have been very positive and we again see premium levels for the validated or FDA-approved test just like we got with KRAS. We have also reached several new agreements for companion diagnostic co-development projects during 2013 and have the largest pipeline ever. One such collaboration was actually announced last week involving a new framework collaboration in details on the first project with Clovis Oncology, and we anticipate making more announcements this year. Our next-generation sequencing initiative is moving ahead on many fronts, and we have news to share today. Our ambition is to offer a broad portfolio of products and services to drive the use of this breakthrough technology in clinical research and diagnostics. We have a 2-pronged approach in the NGS market. First, we're offering many products as universal solutions. In other words, they can be used on any NGS detection platform. Second, we are also advancing our own GeneReader benchtop sequencer, which will use these products as well but integrate them into a seamless work stream from QIAGEN, as we say, from sample to insight. For example, as part of this initiative, today we are also announcing the acquisition of CLC bio, one of the world's leading bioinformatics software developers. CLC is a company that has created a strong leadership position with proprietary algorithms and platforms that accelerate the analysis of biological data, in particular the analysis required to create variant calls from data generated by next-generation sequencers. And this is just one of the many features. The addition of CLC bio means that we have now brought together the key core elements needed for NGS program, enabling QIAGEN to offer complete solutions from biological sample to valuable molecular insights. CLC bio and Ingenuity are very complimentary, and the combination of the 2 further strengthens our ability to create a unique experience for our customers to a seamless link of these engines for data analysis, interpretation and reporting. These transactions support our conviction that customers want more than just a lot of data from sequencing. They want a complete high-quality workflow that provides the most powerful insights. In terms of the NGS portfolio, we continue to make rapid progress on developing our ecosystem of products and services, and remember that this includes an expanding range of gene panels, pre-analytics to extract high-quality DNA material, and also the GeneReader benchtop NGS workflow. A key initiative in 2014 will be the broad commercialization of the broad portfolio, including assays and also the GeneReader to complete the samples-to-insight experience. Feedback from alphabetic customers is positive, and we are on the right track with our paced launch as outlined in the beginning of the year. We're aiming to release systems to further select customers later in 2013, and are preparing for broad commercialization in 2014. In summary, we have the capabilities, resources, focus and the employees to continue the transformation of QIAGEN. I'm now on Slide 5 to provide an overview of results for the 4 customer classes. I think it is fair to say that we are very pleased with the strong double-digit growth in Molecular Diagnostics. The growth rates in Academia and Pharma are slower due to sequestration and ongoing sluggish conditions in some markets that have mentioned -- are being mentioned also by other companies. Molecular Diagnostics again led the performance, delivering double-digit constant exchange rate sales growth in both instrumentation and consumables. These results show the increasing contributions of our growth drivers, which provided 34% of sales and rose 16% on a constant exchange rate basis. In Prevention, the QuantiFERON latent TB test is one of these growth drivers and continues to grow above 20% constant exchange rate. Personalized Healthcare is another growth driver. Within this area, there are different growth dynamics. We again saw higher sales of companion diagnostic kits, but revenues from pharma co-development projects were down sharply from the third quarter of 2012. This is not indicative of the pipeline, which is actually broader than ever, but due to the fact that milestone payments can be volatile and they are part of our business. As years -- after years of investment and expansion, today, we have the critical mass of partnerships so we can manage the changes that are to be expected with pharma R&D projects, and these projects provide us with important differentiated new products for QIAsymphony and our GeneReader NGS solutions. Our Profiling portfolio, also an important growth driver, has been expanding at a solid pace, supported by rising sales contributions from QIAsymphony consumables and instrument placements. As I mentioned, QIAsymphony placements are growing at a double-digit pace, and there's a solid opportunity to maintain the current pace of about 200 to 250 new placements a year for the foreseeable future. Also included in our Molecular Diagnostics area is our portfolio of products for screening women for the human papillomavirus, or HPV, and the risk for cervical cancer. Global sales of these products were up in the third quarter of 2013, rising 3% CER and providing 17% of total sales. Sales outside the U.S. are showing strong growth, well in the double digits, benefiting from successful implementation of screening programs during the third quarter of 2013, and these are part of our business as well. Clearly, the U.S. pricing declines are impacting the overall revenue in this area, and so on a year-to-date basis, our global HPV franchise sales are down about 6% on a CER basis, and we continue to expect about a 10% decline in HPV sales for 2013. The challenges for this product are in the U.S., where we are facing significant pricing pressures as new competitors seek some market share gains with what are typically clinically inferior products. We continue to be very competitive and have a solid leadership position. The sales decline in the third quarter of 2013 in HPV was in line with our expectations and the year-to-date reduction in sales is similar to our full year estimate. As for 2014, we continue to expect U.S. HPV sales to provide less than 10% of total sales. Before moving on, I would like to note that Ingenuity revenues were booked in Molecular Diagnostics, as well as in Pharma and Academia. In the Life Sciences, all customer classes grew despite challenging macroeconomic trends, particularly ahead of the U.S. government shutdown. Applied Testing sales rose at mid-single-digit CER rate, overcoming the outstanding instrument sales a year ago in 2012. Pharma maintained the low-single-digit CER growth rate and was led by the Asia Pacific/Japan region. The impact on Pharma industry restructuring is evident on this customer class. Academia sales were slightly higher in the third quarter, with emerging markets more than offsetting the ongoing cautious spending patterns among customers in the U.S. and partly also in Europe. In the U.S., sales remain under pressure due to sequestration, and we obviously felt a slowdown in September ahead of the U.S. government shutdown. As for the full year impact of the shutdown on our fourth quarter results, you can see that we have reaffirmed our full year targets. I would like to now hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I'm now on Slide 6, and would like review our results for the third quarter of 2013, which were ahead of our targets. Adjusted net sales were USD 323.8 million, representing a 7% constant exchange rates growth and ahead of our target for 6% constant exchange rate growth. About half of our sales growth came from Ingenuity and half from the rest of the portfolio. Currency movements had an adverse impact of about 1 percentage point, and this was due to the yen. The adjusted gross profit margin was steady at about 72% and we continue to benefit from the mix towards more consumables and also from the recently completed efficiency programs. Adjusted operating income rose 5% to USD 87.7 million, supporting major investments in R&D which were higher than in the year ago period as well as in sales and marketing as we ramp up our activities' onward growth drivers. We are also absorbing cost in making investment in Ingenuity for which we are facing dilution of about 100 basis points in 2013. The adjusted operating income margin declined at 2 basis points and rounded out to 27% of sales. The tax rate in the 2013 quarter came in at 80%, and this was generally in line with our target. The outcome is an adjusted EPS growth $0.28 and ahead of our target for $0.27. I'm now on Slide 7 to give you an overview on all regions delivering growth at single-digit constant exchange rate rates. A key growth driver was our performance in the top 7 emerging markets, which together, grew 38% and provided about 15% of adjusted net sales. The strongest growth came in, in Latin America, with China and India also delivering significant gains. These 2 countries brought the Asia Pacific and Japan region, which now accounts for 19% of total sales, with improving results in all customer classes. Japan sales, however, were largely unchanged as stimulus programs have not yet emerged. In Europe, net sales rose 4% constant exchange rate-wise at a faster pace than earlier in the year. Important contributions came from the United Kingdom, Turkey and the Nordic region, as well as from Germany and Italy. Molecular Diagnostics and Applied Testing showed the best results in the region, but life science funding remains an issue, particularly in Southern Europe. The Americas grew 8% constant exchange rate and contributed 50% of net sales, with Mexico and Brazil up on large customer sales for HPV screening. The U.S. showed gains from the Molecular Diagnostics growth driver's providing important in-process [ph]. I'm now on Slide 8, and will provide a few comments on consumables and instruments. Consumables and other revenues provided about 88% of total sales, rising 8% constant exchange rate in the third quarter on growth in all customer classes, particularly with double-digit constant exchange rate growth in Molecular Diagnostics. Revenues from instruments contributed about 12% of total adjusted net sales, largely unchanged compared to the same period in 2012. However, sequentially, this performance shows improving trends from declining instrument sales in the first quarter of the year, which is indicative of the growth in QIAsymphony placements and the multi-year rigid [ph] rental agreements. Capital spending trends continue to weigh on our instrument sales among customers in Academia and Pharma, while Applied Testing return to growth. I'm now on Slide 9 to review our year-to-date results for the first 9 months of 2013. Adjusted net sales rose 4% constant exchange rate-wise to USD 943.7 million, again, with about half of growth coming from acquisitions and half from the rest of the portfolio, the same time off-street [ph] we saw in the third quarter. Currency movements had little impact on reported sales, but we're expecting about a percentage point of headwind on full year 2013 results. Adjusted operating income was largely unchanged at about USD 249.5 million, showing that the improved profitability in the third quarter compared to results for the first half of the year. The adjusted operating income margin was actually at 26.4% for the first 9 months of 2013 compared to 27.6 months (sic) [27.6%] for the year ago period, and our goal remains an adjusted operating income margin of about 28% for the full year. As we have said, this takes into account about 100 basis point dilution from the Ingenuity acquisition and related investments. Moving down the income statement, adjusted net income rose 5%, with a lower tax rate for 2013 actually at the high end of our target range and adjusted EPS of $0.78 per share. I'm now on Slide 10, and here's an update on our financial position. It remains very healthy as we invest in the business, such as through the acquisitions of Ingenuity, while also increasing the terms, such as through the launch of a new share repurchase program in September totaling USD 100 million. As of September 30, 2013, we have liquidity of USD 356 million and our net debt was at a reasonable level of USD 508 million. Leverage has moved up slightly to about 1.2x of net debt to adjusted EBITDA, so we continue to have flexibility to support business expansion and increase returns. Our cash flow performance has been improving during the year, with QIAGEN generating USD 60 million in the third quarter of 2013 and bringing year-to-date free cash flow to USD 121 million, up from USD 107 million in the first 9 months of 2012. This has to be seen in the light of the restructuring charges taken in 2013, which I expected to result in an adverse impact of at least USD 60 million for the year. But given our expectations for no material restructuring charges in 2014, we see opportunities for significant improvement next year. I would like now to hand it back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thanks, Roland. I'm now on Slide 11 to provide some insights on the success of the QIAsymphony automation platform and QIAGEN breaking through the key milestone of 1,000 cumulative placements. The reasons for the uptake are the unique value proposition of the QIAsymphony. Customers are reacting very favorably to the QIAsymphony being the only modular system offering random access, continuous load, sample-to-result processing for both commercial assays, as well as for laboratory-development tests, LDTs. In addition, the 1,000th QIAsymphony that we placed is a nice example. It is used in a pathology lab doing therascreen companion diagnostic assays, Ipsogen, hematology/oncology assays, artus, virology assays as well as PCR base, LDTs and sample preparation for next-generation sequencing. This flexibility is a need that other systems are not able to address. What you see from competitors are screening systems that can only handle a few commercial assays as sample types and not the LDTs, which can be more than half of the test volumes in typical molecular diagnostics lab. So we are pleased with our progress and are continuing our goal for 200, 250 annual placements per year. Moving to Slide 12, here you see an overview of our current menu of Molecular Diagnostics assays and also some of what we are working on in terms of potential submissions. We have 21 CE-IVD assays for use in Europe and other areas of the world. This chart shows only some of the content we have which is the broadest in the industry, and our ambition is to keep expanding across these franchises. In the U.S., 2012 was an important year as we gained approvals for the Rotor-Gene Q PCR cycle and the artus Influenza and therascreen KRAS assays. In terms of potential submissions, we have a full development pipeline. These are also a mix of internal activities, as well as some external collaborations. A key priority of the R&D teams and our partners is expanding the menu especially in the United States, so you will be hearing more from us during the year in terms of regulatory submissions and clearances in the future. I'm now on Slide 13. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving ahead at a rapid pace with our next-generation sequencing initiative targeting clinical research and diagnostics. We've been developing this workflow with clinical research and diagnostic customers as our top priority and addressing their needs. As I mentioned earlier, our portfolio involves a 2-pronged strategy. First, the broad range of products and services, and this includes universal solutions that can be used on any sequencer or with any sequence data; and second, a complete GeneReader integrated streamline workflow. And our actions to take the lead in bioinformatics, in particular analysis and biological interpretation, will be a key differentiator. We are moving ahead to create seamless solutions for our customers to drive science, drug development and clinical diagnostics use. And doing so will position QIAGEN as a unique player in the segment. I'm now on Slide 14 to discuss CLC bio and how this strengthens our offering in bioinformatics. We're very excited to have the employees of CLC bio joining QIAGEN through the acquisition. CLC bio is the global market leader in bioinformatics analysis, offering a proprietary platform that enables customers to rapidly analyze, compare and visualize complex data generated by all major next-generation sequencing platforms, using more than 200 different integrated data analysis tools and with the ability to integrate third-party applications in an app store-type concept as well. As part of the analysis workflow, insights can be gained by leveraging CLC bio's analytics combined with Ingenuity's interpretation. CLC has 2 main products. CLC Genomics Workbench is a user-friendly desktop application that offers more than 200 data analysis tools for any organism. The second product is CLC Genomics Server, which is an enterprise-level platform for rapid and efficient analysis of data from any organism. We see dynamic growth opportunities for these products and bringing them into our emerging portfolio of NGS products will greatly enhance our overall offering. I'm now on Slide 15. This slide provides some perspectives on the powerful solutions offered by CLC, and how these user-friendly and scalable solutions anchored by CLC Genomics Server do rapidly analyze and visualize any sequencer data from any organism. A key point is that CLC's technologies are used for analysis of any organism by their customers, which span from research to clinical areas, but also in areas beyond human health care, such as plant science. As for some anecdotes about the market adoption power of CLC solutions, more than 1.5 million downloads have already been completed of the software to over 250,000 unique users around the world at over 2,300 different organizations. 250,000 unique users. The largest genome ever-published, a 21 gigabases Norwegian spruce tree, was analyzed using CLC bio software and published in Nature in May 2013. As a comparison, a human genome involves about 7x less giga -- data, about 3 gigabases of DNA. And on the technology side, CLC bio partners with organism -- organizations like Intel, IBM and Oracle and many others. I'm now on Slide 16, which shows how we are building on the strength of QIAGEN, CLC bio and Ingenuity to strengthen our leadership in bioinformatics and our overall NGS workflow. This acquisition is a natural, logical step after Ingenuity, and together, they enable QIAGEN to create a complete and seamless workflow. In a simplified explanation, CLC bio's products begin with a data generated by the sequencer, taking care of assembly steps before performing very complex analysis to call the variant or what is interesting in the data set. With the output of this variant calling step, which can be a VCF file, customers can use Ingenuity solutions for interpretation and reporting. No other supplier has a workflow covering this complete workflow, especially in terms of the dry lab bioinformatics offering that is seen as a key bottleneck to adoption of NGS in clinical research and diagnostics. I'm now on Slide 17 and here, you see an update on Ingenuity solutions and in particular, recent announcements that back up the view that they are becoming the gold standard for biological data interpretation. Ingenuity offers the deepest and broadest understanding of biology compared to competitors. The superior quality of this content has been built up with massive investments over more than a decade, and involves scientific experts and key opinion leaders who manually curate and ensure quality control. This quality stands out well ahead of any other product and has a major impact on the quality of interpretation, even minute quality advantages and our quality benefits are actually very significant. Even minute differences can lead to significantly increased reproducibility and scientific or clinical interpretation, especially if customers are mining millions of data points. So we see Ingenuity's knowledge base and intuitive applications providing a sustainable competitive advantage for years. With more than 4,000 users representing over 500 leading institutions, variant analysis is enjoying rapid uptake in research and clinical areas, and this goes far beyond oncology. Among the new customers is the Genetic Testing Laboratory at the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at Mountain Sinai in New York, which has adopted variant analysis for research and translational genomics applications related to characterizing and identifying rare diseases. We also have a new collaboration with the Center for Applied Genomics at the Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, involving a large-scale NGS study to identify causative variants in rare childhood diseases. These are just 2 among the many, many new uses of variant analysis, which is clearly becoming the gold standard in biological data interpretation and answering a critical need of customers looking for better ways to make sense of biological data. I'm now on Slide 18. We recently announced an important new partnership with Clovis Oncology, which has significant -- which has significance for a variety of reasons. First, this is another of the framework agreements that we are reaching with pharma partners to develop a series of companion diagnostics. Second, this announcement shows how our tests are setting industry standards. In this case, many of you know that this companion diagnostic project was originally planned with another diagnostics provider and had been widely announced in 2011. However, with the FDA approval of our therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic, a critical differentiator merged with our test as this is covering more mutations and in particular, T790M, the most prevalent resistant mutation on non-small cell lung cancer patients, that led to a selection of our therascreen test. This was a key factor in this new collaboration, one that we see as adding to our reputation for having the industry's leading portfolio. Others have recognized the value of our EGFR test and also FDA-approved KRAS test as well through the premium reimbursement in the United States and in the United Kingdom, both tests have received positive recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, and draft guideline recommendations. These collaborations span real-time PCR. These collaborations in companion diagnostics with our pharma partners span real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing technologies and we are well-positioned to offer the broadest range of biological content, detection technologies and bioinformatics for any testing needs. I'd like to hand now back to Roland. Roland Sackers Yes thank you, Peer. I'm now on Slide 19 to review our guidance for the fourth quarter and the full year 2013. We have reaffirmed full year guidance for adjusted net sales growth of about 5% constant exchange rate-wise. This is based on about half coming from manager [ph] being treated as an acquisition through May 2013 as well as from Ingenuity, and the other half coming from the rest of the business. For adjusted diluted EPS, the guidance remains at $1.13 per share. Our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013 is for adjusted net sales growth of about 6% constant exchange rate-wise, with about half of growth coming from Ingenuity and half from the rest of the portfolio, and for adjusted diluted EPS of approximately $0.35. The contributions from CLC bio for 2013 are very modest for the quarter. The slide also contains assumptions for adjustment to results for the fourth quarter on the expect [ph]; share-based compensation of about USD 10 million; about $30 million for amortization and acquired intellectual property; about $20 million to $25 million for business integration, acquisition and restructuring items on pre-tax operating income. Of this amount, we expect about USD 15 million to USD 20 million for residual construction cost from the efficiency project. The adjusted tax rate is expected to be about 17% to 18%, and this compares with a sequential tax rate of 23% in the second quarter and 18% in the third quarter of 2013. For the full year, we expect share-based compensation of about USD 37 million, and I want to remind you that we are not going to adjust for this cost starting in 2014. About USD 150 million for amortization of acquired intellectual property and about USD 130 million to USD 135 million for business integration and acquisition restructuring costs and of which, about USD 110 million to USD 150 million were for restructuring, and these types of charges are not going to be adjusted for us starting in 2014, as well. The adjusted tax rate is expected at about 20%, which compares with 21% in 2012. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 20 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. Our results show the ability of QIAGEN's development [ph] challenging conditions through discipline and focus on creating value. We are making progress on our initiatives to accelerate innovation and in particular, growth, and we have reaffirmed our plans to deliver improved sales and earnings for the year. This commitment to improving sales growth is accompanied by focus on improving earnings and cash flow as well, and we're also improving returns, such as through the launch of a new 100 million share repurchase program earlier this quarter. Let me review what we have announced. We exceeded our targets for the third quarter in terms of sales and adjusted earnings growth. We have reached a key milestone by exceeding 1,000 cumulative placements for the QIAsymphony automation platform and see significant untapped opportunities ahead. Our next-generation sequencing initiative is moving ahead on multiple fronts. We have announced the acquisition of CLC bio, which provides QIAGEN with global leadership in biological data analysis and highly complements the gold standard biological data interpretation from Ingenuity. The rapid uptake of Ingenuity Solutions confirms our conviction that integrating the gold standard for biological interpretation is a crucial differentiator in our NGS product portfolio. On the NGS workflow, we are working with early-access customers in alpha/beta testing, and we're preparing for the planned phase launch and then broad commercialization 2014. And the launch of our second $100 million share repurchase program announced in July, is a signal of our commitment to using our solid financial position to strengthen our business, as well as to increase returns. In closing, we have reaffirmed our full year 2013 guidance and delivering on our goals for innovation and growth during 2013. With that, I'd like to hand back to the operator to open up for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. One question and maybe one follow-up question. And first of all, on the development you're currently seeing in the pharma and academic research customer segments, can you potentially comment on what you expect in Q4 potentially going into 2014 and as a momentum? And a short follow-up question, the dilution on the adjusted EBIT margin coming from Ingenuity in the 100 basis point, is that said something we should also expect for Q4 when comparing it with Q4 last year? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Daniel. I'll take the first part and hand over to Roland for the second. The developments in Academia are very difficult to extrapolate because we clearly have some major impacts in this area in 2013. So we had sequestration, we had now some -- all these complexities around the budget creation for 2014 and the temporary releases now and the shutdowns, so this has been a very choppy time for Academia. It's very difficult to predict what we will see in 2014, with increased certainty with a solid budget even at a low growth rate, there is hope for some improvement in that area, which is clearly a low-growth area at the moment. U.S. Academia sales are somewhat in the range of 12%, 13% of our sales base, so it's not a huge exposure that we have but one that we are monitoring. So I wouldn't expect anything very different in '14, '13 yet, but with important milestones coming up, this could change. Pharma is an area that we want to look at more closely. To be very frank, we think we have more potential in Pharma than what we are delivering on now, and we're looking at new ways to enhance growth in Pharma. Consolidations remain headwinds. The increased integration with the bioinformatics where you have users and some of the hundreds of users across the company that you can link into reagent flows and insurance opportunities, plus also the link into companion diagnostics, is creating new opportunities for us. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. Hi, Daniel. The long answer is, yes, so we clearly continue to invest Ingenuity, and as we said in the press release earlier this year, it is clearly, in effect, to see for the full year 2013, clearly seeing a quite significant revenue impact over the course of 2014, mitigating some of this dilution, nevertheless, for the fourth quarter exactly as you assumed, we have the similar impact. Operator And our next question is from Zarak Khurshid from Wedbush Securities. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Just curious, Peer and Roland, on the robust QIAsymphony placements. Can you speak to utilization on those instruments? How should we be thinking about consumable pull-through going forward? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Utilizations have been going up, and they're very different across the different regions, though. So in the U.S., the majority of the revenue base and pull-through is on deteriorations and components associated with LDTs. The situation is very different in Europe with 21 assays as you have seen from this. I think this is something that is often underestimated. Our menu breadth is far ahead of anything that anybody has in Europe and it's several times larger than the broadest menu that is available in the States. So the menu for us to address of the commercial asset is definitely driving the growth rates in Europe and blood virals and companion diagnostics and hematology are definitely leading the pack there. The utilization rates are moving up. We said that theoretical utilization of the system is in the high hundreds of thousands of dollars at very high utilization. The -- we said that we probably would see numbers somewhere between 150,000, 200,000 over time. We're not there yet, so we still have a lot of room up. We might be somewhere in the range. If you take an average, it's difficult. In Europe, it's well above 100,000. In the States, it's below 100,000. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Fantastic. And then as a brief follow-up regarding the QuantiFERON franchise, obviously, very strong growth there. How should we be thinking about the current penetration of that product in the United States and other geographies? What sort of inning are we in? And how big can this business be? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Also here, the regional difference is based on the type of application or the type of screening program that is run. So in Japan, where broader-based screening is being done, the penetration is higher, and the U.S., the penetration is very low. In theory, we all know that about 55 million skin tests are done every year, and we are currently, if you look at the revenue base that we have, we're in the low single-digit millions of tests that we are currently selling. So this would indicate that there is a major headroom and many, many years of growth opportunity in front of us. We have the ability to scale. So unlike other products, we can offer high throughput automation that allow an institution, a laboratory, a hospital to run hundreds of samples, and this is not possible with any alternative offering. So we are quite excited about further penetration opportunities. Operator And our next question is from Vijay Kumar from ISI. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division So maybe my first one for Sir Peer. Clearly, your M&A strategy has been successful. You had AmniSure and Cellestis being in January all sort of coming in above expectations. And I want to dig in on the sequencing for -- on the informatics side, right? In January, I think when you look at those, the expectations was 20% kind of growth there should imply $25 million of revenues for next year. We're clearly at the $40 million run rate. A, what is driving this trend? And how should we think about growth on the informatics side going forward? And I guess, are there any implications for CLC bio now? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, we think that the availability of tools that allow the generation of a lot of data that, that will drive a necessity for more powerful and standardized analyses and interpretation solutions. So as compared to the emergence of data processing technologies 4 years ago, the majority of the data processing software solutions were typically home-brew, self-developed solutions in institutions that have the capability to do that. But with the increased dissemination of powerful tools, you saw commercialized software packages emerge, standardizing a broad range of different applications and democratizing the use of these powerful new technologies, and this is exactly what we expect to see in bioinformatics as well. The majority of the market today is doing home-brew, self-developed tools and using them and successfully also, but it is very difficult to scale. And the solutions we have, both through use of cloud technologies, but also through the availability of enterprise-level solutions now, we have -- we're offering off-the-shelf package software solutions that allow almost overnight turnkey installations of highly -- of the most advanced data analysis and imitation [ph] solutions in almost any laboratory. So this means that this market in bioinformatics, which maybe $100 million today, is only the commercial tip of the iceberg and is dwarfed by the expense and the efforts that are currently being employed to home-brew solutions that we think, over time, will increasingly also -- not completely obviously, but increasingly also turn to standardized, off-the-shelf solutions. And we're there with I think a very, very nice offering. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Great. And maybe one quick housekeeping question for Roland. On the restructuring, Roland, what was the breakout between sales and marketing, G&A and R&D? Roland Sackers For the full year, we expect it really to be -- actually, they are different operational expense lines. We clearly see a larger positive impact on the sales and marketing side for the second part of 2013, as this was clearly one of the areas where we, I would say, did it very phased, very controlled, where, on the M&A [ph] situation side, we have seen a larger impact already moving into 2013 in terms of positive contributions. So I would say, it's fairly spreaded R&D. I would say also, made a long-term [indiscernible] very comfortable with 11% of revenues going into R&D, where, at the same time, we expect sales and marketing expenses, as a relative number coming, down and giving us leverage moving into 2014. Operator And our next question is from Patrick Donnelly from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division It's actually Tycho here. First one, I guess, on NGS. Can you talk about timing for CE mark? And then I think you'd also maybe intonated in the past, you might consider introducing the QIAcube NGS module first as a stand-alone, so can you maybe talk about how you think about bringing that to market? And then lastly, do you have all the pieces you need for from a workflow perspective? And can you also maybe just talk on the SAP agreement, and where that stands? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So if you look at the -- if you look at the GeneReader workflow today, we have, obviously, an extremely strong position in extraction, and we will be talking about some exciting new sample to purify nucleic acid innovations that we will be bringing forward specifically for next-generation sequencing. We have some quite interesting and, some cases, startling new discoveries there. And the second step in the enrichment assay panels, we were moving to 20 assay panels this year to GeneRead assay panels. They're all linked into Ingenuity Knowledge Base interpretations are really differentiated capability. The library preparation steps as well, that is pretty much what we already have today that looks very good. The sequencing step is in light of all of these things actually quite straightforward. Application, that's one we are -- we have in the late stage of development. And if you look at the bioinformatics, the generation of a FASTQ file, we have been working on that for several years now. We have a very good solution, we think. We are further strengthening that with some algorithms and CLC. CLC brings to us, then, the FASTQ to VCF file generation also beyond that, but that is a core expertise, the FASTQ to VCF. And then from VCF to interpretive results, Ingenuity has a spectacular leadership there. So in theory, we have all the pieces now to put everything together, and we're assembling that. And now with the addition of CLC, which we're very proud and excited to have now, we're clearly now using this time also to make sure that the CLC portfolio is perfectly linked into the GeneRead assays and also the GeneReader system. In terms of... Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Go ahead. Peer M. Schatz Sorry. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I was just going to add timing for CE mark and then potentially, when we can start to see some customer data? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So the -- we've always been very open that the solution that we are bringing to market should have a CE and also an IVD track, and we have been very diligent about making sure that everything we do also allows us to move in that direction very swiftly. So we're not talking years after launch. This is something that should happen near term. And we want to have a very stable system and one that also has several years of launch activity in front of it, which is a problem. Most systems are now being CE-marked or IVD-approved, and a month later, the software, the reagent change and then all the effort was basically useless. So what we're trying to do is to create a certain degree of stability, but that should coincide very closely with the launch. So I'm talking around your question, I know, but we haven't announced a clear date on that and we will be coming out with that shortly. And data on the system is something that -- I know everybody would like to see that, but we are going to a bring that to our customers first. We have several events that, as we always said, would be a crescendo of information. We have an upcoming AMP event, we have AGBT, we have several important investor conferences also in January and we want to make sure that we have a nice flow of news that we can provide to you. The data per se on the sequencers is now driving the customer discussions. What is blowing customers away right now is our ability to take the data generation from a blood tube into a report that can be put into an envelope and that potentially can even create a reimbursable event. That is something that we clearly are poised to be able to offer, and I think that will be a differentiator. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Yes. And then, do you think KRAS media [indiscernible] primarily get done on assays and then reflex to NGS? And I guess, last question, how do you think about that dynamic between assays and NGS? Peer M. Schatz I think that's an excellent point, Tycho, and that's how these products fit together. I think some of these assays will be reflexed into NGS. Some will be NGS on a primary and some will only be PCR. So there were recent papers written on prints in some hematological cancers that people think that NGS might be an option, but it has been clearly shown that it is clinically and economically not justified to do that. So you'll probably screen on PCR, and if at all, then reflex. Other types of diseases you might see go NGS. So I think having the availability of PCR and NGS under one roof gives us an enormous differentiator in the clinical market because we -- we're basically objective and we'll try to provide what is economically and clinically the best solution. It will be very different for different diseases and for different reimbursement environments. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division First question for me, I guess, kind of staying on the timing side of things here, Peer. You talked about the deep pipeline within Symphony. Can you help us think a little bit about timing around things like moving HPV there, chlamydia, gonorrhoeae, HAIs, perhaps even the virals, as well? Peer M. Schatz Sure. You saw from the slide that we presented in January of this year, and we have a different version of the portfolio comparing it to competitive offerings in the market now in this deck that we shared today. There's a lot going through the pipeline. We have some near-term launches that, if I recall the dates that we announced last January, so we have some near-term launches in the HAI and also in some of the women's health areas in the U.S., as well. In Europe, the launch of our CT/NG assay was done in the third quarter. We're getting great uptake. It's a dual-target CT assay with NGS also packaged in, so we're targeting both the genomic and the flat targets and CT in a very unique way with great sensitivity. So we've seen good uptake on CT/NG already in the third quarter in Europe. And this is one that we're also bringing forward to the States, and that will be something that will be in clinicals next year. So we're chugging along, and I guess we'll have a handful of submissions overall this year at the company and maybe a tick more even next year in the U.S. And we also have the CMV assay still in front of FDA right now with the final module being submitted, hopefully this year. That was a very long process due to the complexity of that target, but the assay looks fantastic. We're quite bullish [indiscernible]. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Very good, very good. And then just a follow-up on an earlier question around QuantiFERON. Obviously, really open-ended opportunity here, given the low penetration rates, particularly in the States. Can you talk a little bit, Peer, about how does the trajectory of this change, if at all, once we see the improved supplies -- tuberculin for the skin test to come back in the market? And then if you have any sort of update or guesstimate as to when we might actually see that old technology coming back? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Once people have started using QuantiFERON, we typically don't see them flipping back, because the ease of administration and the hospital network, the quality of the product, the digital output, it just makes it so much easier for the physicians. So from that perspective, you might lose a few back to TST, but there's no cost advantages, certainly no clinical advantage and there's absolutely no administrative or workflow advantage of using the skin test. And so we think that's -- the majority is here to stay. The same is true also with competitive wins, laboratories, service labs or alternative products are used due to low availability of our product or other where we had some supply issues in Japan, for instance. We're quite convinced that we can move that back very quickly. We -- also, we're on the process now, final process, of moving into China, and these are big markets for these products that we are looking forward to address. So there's a lot of runway, and we don't think that customers, once they see our benefits, are open to -- into going back to the old world. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Got it. And if I can sneak just one last one in here, Peer. You mentioned that Japan, the academic overall was flattish there. At least one of your competitors has talked about the -- potentially the early stages or resurgence in academic funding over there. Can you just talk to that geography, in general? And then I guess, specifically, kind of how are you're looking at that either in the fourth quarter, maybe more about longer-term 2014, 2015 outlook? Peer M. Schatz Yes, it's a good question, and you're putting us a little bit on the spot here because we all know that there is a very significant uptick that could be expected for many of these stimulus funding. The problem is timing and calling that, and we've seen that so often in Japan and we have been burned a few times by expecting lost pass [ph] or this or this to happen. And it's sometimes quite opaque [ph] when and how these things get implemented. So our team tells us here at the moment that they're not seeing any material inflows at all, and there's still a lot of uncertainty if and when this will come. And when we say, look, it's being fantastic and it's now -- seems to be firm. And the answer comes back, nothing is firm at the moment. So we'll believe it when we see the money, and we haven't seen the money yet. Operator And the next question is from Mr. Brian Weinstein from William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division My question is on the investments that you've made in bioinformatics. They've been impressive and I think they make a lot of sense. How specifically do you monetize these investments when you have everything integrated? And then how does SAP, your relationship there, continue to play into things? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Brian. And I'm sorry, Tycho, I forgot also the SAP question, so I'll bundle that into the answer here. The business models of selling bioinformatics on a stand-alone basis are difficult. And if you look at the stand-alone business models, it is difficult to see a lot of value generation in this market. The value really comes from creating a platform and a delivery vehicle. And for us, that is not the sequencer. It is actually the assay. So the important thing in the workflow is the assay. The detection can be generic and our assays, for instance, run on most available sequencers. They invent the bioinformatics and we can get a premium on the price of the assay by embedding bioinformatics. On the analysis side, we're simply making it easier to use our interpretation, as well, and also fewer [ph] are getting subscriptions or are able to create a nicer umbrella and framework for the sample team-type [ph] workflow regardless of the detection system. That is critical. We're pretty agnostic as to that. We have a very, very good sequencer coming up, but that's not the differentiating part of our NGS strategy alone. It is really also the availability of this -- of ability to monetize the strength in the workflow management bioinformatics through integration with that chemistry that are universally applicable. We are currently in discussion with SAP on implementation of their HANA technology, which allows ultrafast analyses of unstructured data bases. We've been kind of holding off on that due to -- until we have clarity around the CLC the acquisition which we now have, and with the analysis framework now as part of our organization. We are accelerating these discussions to see how we can use that powerful new technology for our analysis solutions. Operator Our next question is from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division So I had, I guess, a couple of questions on HPV. As you noted, U.S. HPV declined about 10% year-over-year. But if I'm doing the math right, it appears that U.S. HPV revenue is actually stable in Q3 relative to Q2 levels. It may have even improved a little bit sequentially. So could you discuss what's happening today and what you expect to happen moving forward? You talked about pricing in your prepared remarks, but it would be interesting to hear a little bit more about that, as well as what's going on in terms of share and the impact of testing intervals. And I guess, looking ahead, is there a level where you would expect U.S. HPV's revenue to bottom out? Again, it seemed like you had an okay quarter. Does it seem like U.S. HPV revenue could kind of bottom out and stay at the high-20s levels on a quarterly basis? Peer M. Schatz On the high-20s levels... Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I'm sorry, high like $20 million to $30 million. Peer M. Schatz U.S. HPV? Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Yes. Peer M. Schatz Oh, okay. Well, in general, you're absolutely right. The third quarter definitely had a nice development on HPV on a number of different fronts, and we are quite successful in bringing forward or highlighting our clinical advantages. The publications that are coming out, we're not really announcing those now through the [ph] Street, but I mean, customers are clearly seeing a lot of news come out on alternative testing approaches, PCR or other amplification technologies that are just showing very, very poor results and -- especially in screening programs. So we are in a good position there and are holding our market share quite nicely. Unfortunately, a lot of labs are under cost pressures, so -- which means quite desperate pricing approaches by some of the competitors that we, at least partly have to also accommodate our pricing. And so pricing has definitely come down considerably. Volumes have actually been quite solid. The outlook going forward for the U.S. HPV market is -- were pulling on track. We set x genotyping to have in '14 2/3 of the market, maybe 70%, but that's something we still believe is possible. Now if you look at some of the doomsday predictions we saw 2 or 3 years ago, that's almost twice as high. We definitely see that there will continue, however, to be a decline in revenues, probably through -- at least through '15, and that will probably be at the same pace that we're currently seeing. X U.S. is a totally different story. We are -- because if you don't have liquid cytology as an adjunct test, our test blows away anything else in the marketplace, hands down, because it's an easier workflow, much faster and much easier to perform. And so from that perspective, x U.S. will continue to have a lot of opportunities over the next few years. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division And maybe my follow-up related to the last comment, it does look like o U.S. HPV revenue increased by something like $5 million from Q2 to Q3. Is that a sign of demand really picking up along the lines of what you just described? Or is there something along the lines of a tender being pulled forward, or is this truly just a sign of fundamental demand picking up? Peer M. Schatz Fundamental demand is definitely quite interesting, but these deals are quite lumpy. There's always been the purchase of an [indiscernible] inventory level [indiscernible] when this is planned or so, it will definitely be something that will be a little bit more volatile on a revenue base. Roland, do you want to comment on that? Roland Sackers No, no, more or less exactly what you said. As you said, we had a good quarter. In third quarter, we won a couple of tenders, and typically these tenders start with, also, a larger shipment. It's beginning nevertheless. It is typically tenders going for a few years or so. Operator And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Just, Roland, when you start going to including stock comp in your '14 guidance, is the $37 million you're looking at in 2013, is that a reasonable number to think about for next year? Roland Sackers Excellent question, and it's clearly one of the focus points on our Analyst Day to give you some more insight and break-ups that you have a comparable base, and we all talk about apples to apples for 2014 [indiscernible] compensation but also other charges. So I'll give you more insight on Analyst Day, and happy, as you know, to welcome you there. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. Also Roland, can you give us some general split between where Ingenuity was in the different buckets? Just some general guidance on the revenues. Are we going to have apples-to-apples organic current, new [ph] growth rate for the businesses? Roland Sackers Yes, as I said on the call, it's really Molecular in Life Science and in Pharma, where just to give a rough indication, it's probably 1/4 in Molecular. And so right now, again, it might be different in a different quarter, 1/4 in the last quarter in Molecular and the rest in Life Science. [indiscernible] together, to be precise. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Great. Just one quick one if I can squeeze it in. Peer, what's the turnaround time on your CT/NG test? And when you think about the strategy in the U.S., is the QIAsymphony a moderate or high complexity platform? Peer M. Schatz Oh, Derik, the latter one is a very interesting question. If you look at it, the QIAsymphony -- in the modular version that we have today, which is actually the preferred [indiscernible] for LDT customers and people using a broad range of menu, they don't want to have an integrated system. They actually prefer a modular system. But for CT/NG or some other assays, an integrated system is a preferred route, and the symphony was always designed as a modular system with the option to fully integrate the detection. If you would do that, in theory, you could think about a moderate complexity system that seems to fulfill all of the specifications to get there. And so this is putting -- this is definitely a very interesting question you're asking, and some -- one that we're spending time on. In terms of the system, that the turnaround time, [indiscernible] I'd have to get back to you on that one. I don't have that data here right now. But maybe that's one we could ask at Analyst Day. It is definitely a very competitive assay. John Gilardi So with that, I'd like to close the conference call and thank all of you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us, and we look forward to seeing you at our Investor event in November. Thank you. Peer M. Schatz Thank you.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today is from Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. One question and maybe one follow-up question. And first of all, on the development you're currently seeing in the pharma and academic research customer segments, can you potentially comment on what you expect in Q4 potentially going into 2014 and as a momentum? And a short follow-up question, the dilution on the adjusted EBIT margin coming from Ingenuity in the 100 basis point, is that said something we should also expect for Q4 when comparing it with Q4 last year? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Daniel. I'll take the first part and hand over to Roland for the second. The developments in Academia are very difficult to extrapolate because we clearly have some major impacts in this area in 2013. So we had sequestration, we had now some -- all these complexities around the budget creation for 2014 and the temporary releases now and the shutdowns, so this has been a very choppy time for Academia. It's very difficult to predict what we will see in 2014, with increased certainty with a solid budget even at a low growth rate, there is hope for some improvement in that area, which is clearly a low-growth area at the moment. U.S. Academia sales are somewhat in the range of 12%, 13% of our sales base, so it's not a huge exposure that we have but one that we are monitoring. So I wouldn't expect anything very different in '14, '13 yet, but with important milestones coming up, this could change. Pharma is an area that we want to look at more closely. To be very frank, we think we have more potential in Pharma than what we are delivering on now, and we're looking at new ways to enhance growth in Pharma. Consolidations remain headwinds. The increased integration with the bioinformatics where you have users and some of the hundreds of users across the company that you can link into reagent flows and insurance opportunities, plus also the link into companion diagnostics, is creating new opportunities for us. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. Hi, Daniel. The long answer is, yes, so we clearly continue to invest Ingenuity, and as we said in the press release earlier this year, it is clearly, in effect, to see for the full year 2013, clearly seeing a quite significant revenue impact over the course of 2014, mitigating some of this dilution, nevertheless, for the fourth quarter exactly as you assumed, we have the similar impact. Operator And our next question is from Zarak Khurshid from Wedbush Securities. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Just curious, Peer and Roland, on the robust QIAsymphony placements. Can you speak to utilization on those instruments? How should we be thinking about consumable pull-through going forward? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Utilizations have been going up, and they're very different across the different regions, though. So in the U.S., the majority of the revenue base and pull-through is on deteriorations and components associated with LDTs. The situation is very different in Europe with 21 assays as you have seen from this. I think this is something that is often underestimated. Our menu breadth is far ahead of anything that anybody has in Europe and it's several times larger than the broadest menu that is available in the States. So the menu for us to address of the commercial asset is definitely driving the growth rates in Europe and blood virals and companion diagnostics and hematology are definitely leading the pack there. The utilization rates are moving up. We said that theoretical utilization of the system is in the high hundreds of thousands of dollars at very high utilization. The -- we said that we probably would see numbers somewhere between 150,000, 200,000 over time. We're not there yet, so we still have a lot of room up. We might be somewhere in the range. If you take an average, it's difficult. In Europe, it's well above 100,000. In the States, it's below 100,000. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Fantastic. And then as a brief follow-up regarding the QuantiFERON franchise, obviously, very strong growth there. How should we be thinking about the current penetration of that product in the United States and other geographies? What sort of inning are we in? And how big can this business be? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Also here, the regional difference is based on the type of application or the type of screening program that is run. So in Japan, where broader-based screening is being done, the penetration is higher, and the U.S., the penetration is very low. In theory, we all know that about 55 million skin tests are done every year, and we are currently, if you look at the revenue base that we have, we're in the low single-digit millions of tests that we are currently selling. So this would indicate that there is a major headroom and many, many years of growth opportunity in front of us. We have the ability to scale. So unlike other products, we can offer high throughput automation that allow an institution, a laboratory, a hospital to run hundreds of samples, and this is not possible with any alternative offering. So we are quite excited about further penetration opportunities. Operator And our next question is from Vijay Kumar from ISI. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division So maybe my first one for Sir Peer. Clearly, your M&A strategy has been successful. You had AmniSure and Cellestis being in January all sort of coming in above expectations. And I want to dig in on the sequencing for -- on the informatics side, right? In January, I think when you look at those, the expectations was 20% kind of growth there should imply $25 million of revenues for next year. We're clearly at the $40 million run rate. A, what is driving this trend? And how should we think about growth on the informatics side going forward? And I guess, are there any implications for CLC bio now? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, we think that the availability of tools that allow the generation of a lot of data that, that will drive a necessity for more powerful and standardized analyses and interpretation solutions. So as compared to the emergence of data processing technologies 4 years ago, the majority of the data processing software solutions were typically home-brew, self-developed solutions in institutions that have the capability to do that. But with the increased dissemination of powerful tools, you saw commercialized software packages emerge, standardizing a broad range of different applications and democratizing the use of these powerful new technologies, and this is exactly what we expect to see in bioinformatics as well. The majority of the market today is doing home-brew, self-developed tools and using them and successfully also, but it is very difficult to scale. And the solutions we have, both through use of cloud technologies, but also through the availability of enterprise-level solutions now, we have -- we're offering off-the-shelf package software solutions that allow almost overnight turnkey installations of highly -- of the most advanced data analysis and imitation [ph] solutions in almost any laboratory. So this means that this market in bioinformatics, which maybe $100 million today, is only the commercial tip of the iceberg and is dwarfed by the expense and the efforts that are currently being employed to home-brew solutions that we think, over time, will increasingly also -- not completely obviously, but increasingly also turn to standardized, off-the-shelf solutions. And we're there with I think a very, very nice offering. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Great. And maybe one quick housekeeping question for Roland. On the restructuring, Roland, what was the breakout between sales and marketing, G&A and R&D? Roland Sackers For the full year, we expect it really to be -- actually, they are different operational expense lines. We clearly see a larger positive impact on the sales and marketing side for the second part of 2013, as this was clearly one of the areas where we, I would say, did it very phased, very controlled, where, on the M&A [ph] situation side, we have seen a larger impact already moving into 2013 in terms of positive contributions. So I would say, it's fairly spreaded R&D. I would say also, made a long-term [indiscernible] very comfortable with 11% of revenues going into R&D, where, at the same time, we expect sales and marketing expenses, as a relative number coming, down and giving us leverage moving into 2014. Operator And our next question is from Patrick Donnelly from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division It's actually Tycho here. First one, I guess, on NGS. Can you talk about timing for CE mark? And then I think you'd also maybe intonated in the past, you might consider introducing the QIAcube NGS module first as a stand-alone, so can you maybe talk about how you think about bringing that to market? And then lastly, do you have all the pieces you need for from a workflow perspective? And can you also maybe just talk on the SAP agreement, and where that stands? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So if you look at the -- if you look at the GeneReader workflow today, we have, obviously, an extremely strong position in extraction, and we will be talking about some exciting new sample to purify nucleic acid innovations that we will be bringing forward specifically for next-generation sequencing. We have some quite interesting and, some cases, startling new discoveries there. And the second step in the enrichment assay panels, we were moving to 20 assay panels this year to GeneRead assay panels. They're all linked into Ingenuity Knowledge Base interpretations are really differentiated capability. The library preparation steps as well, that is pretty much what we already have today that looks very good. The sequencing step is in light of all of these things actually quite straightforward. Application, that's one we are -- we have in the late stage of development. And if you look at the bioinformatics, the generation of a FASTQ file, we have been working on that for several years now. We have a very good solution, we think. We are further strengthening that with some algorithms and CLC. CLC brings to us, then, the FASTQ to VCF file generation also beyond that, but that is a core expertise, the FASTQ to VCF. And then from VCF to interpretive results, Ingenuity has a spectacular leadership there. So in theory, we have all the pieces now to put everything together, and we're assembling that. And now with the addition of CLC, which we're very proud and excited to have now, we're clearly now using this time also to make sure that the CLC portfolio is perfectly linked into the GeneRead assays and also the GeneReader system. In terms of... Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Go ahead. Peer M. Schatz Sorry. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I was just going to add timing for CE mark and then potentially, when we can start to see some customer data? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So the -- we've always been very open that the solution that we are bringing to market should have a CE and also an IVD track, and we have been very diligent about making sure that everything we do also allows us to move in that direction very swiftly. So we're not talking years after launch. This is something that should happen near term. And we want to have a very stable system and one that also has several years of launch activity in front of it, which is a problem. Most systems are now being CE-marked or IVD-approved, and a month later, the software, the reagent change and then all the effort was basically useless. So what we're trying to do is to create a certain degree of stability, but that should coincide very closely with the launch. So I'm talking around your question, I know, but we haven't announced a clear date on that and we will be coming out with that shortly. And data on the system is something that -- I know everybody would like to see that, but we are going to a bring that to our customers first. We have several events that, as we always said, would be a crescendo of information. We have an upcoming AMP event, we have AGBT, we have several important investor conferences also in January and we want to make sure that we have a nice flow of news that we can provide to you. The data per se on the sequencers is now driving the customer discussions. What is blowing customers away right now is our ability to take the data generation from a blood tube into a report that can be put into an envelope and that potentially can even create a reimbursable event. That is something that we clearly are poised to be able to offer, and I think that will be a differentiator. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Yes. And then, do you think KRAS media [indiscernible] primarily get done on assays and then reflex to NGS? And I guess, last question, how do you think about that dynamic between assays and NGS? Peer M. Schatz I think that's an excellent point, Tycho, and that's how these products fit together. I think some of these assays will be reflexed into NGS. Some will be NGS on a primary and some will only be PCR. So there were recent papers written on prints in some hematological cancers that people think that NGS might be an option, but it has been clearly shown that it is clinically and economically not justified to do that. So you'll probably screen on PCR, and if at all, then reflex. Other types of diseases you might see go NGS. So I think having the availability of PCR and NGS under one roof gives us an enormous differentiator in the clinical market because we -- we're basically objective and we'll try to provide what is economically and clinically the best solution. It will be very different for different diseases and for different reimbursement environments. Operator Our next question comes from Mr. Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division First question for me, I guess, kind of staying on the timing side of things here, Peer. You talked about the deep pipeline within Symphony. Can you help us think a little bit about timing around things like moving HPV there, chlamydia, gonorrhoeae, HAIs, perhaps even the virals, as well? Peer M. Schatz Sure. You saw from the slide that we presented in January of this year, and we have a different version of the portfolio comparing it to competitive offerings in the market now in this deck that we shared today. There's a lot going through the pipeline. We have some near-term launches that, if I recall the dates that we announced last January, so we have some near-term launches in the HAI and also in some of the women's health areas in the U.S., as well. In Europe, the launch of our CT/NG assay was done in the third quarter. We're getting great uptake. It's a dual-target CT assay with NGS also packaged in, so we're targeting both the genomic and the flat targets and CT in a very unique way with great sensitivity. So we've seen good uptake on CT/NG already in the third quarter in Europe. And this is one that we're also bringing forward to the States, and that will be something that will be in clinicals next year. So we're chugging along, and I guess we'll have a handful of submissions overall this year at the company and maybe a tick more even next year in the U.S. And we also have the CMV assay still in front of FDA right now with the final module being submitted, hopefully this year. That was a very long process due to the complexity of that target, but the assay looks fantastic. We're quite bullish [indiscernible]. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Very good, very good. And then just a follow-up on an earlier question around QuantiFERON. Obviously, really open-ended opportunity here, given the low penetration rates, particularly in the States. Can you talk a little bit, Peer, about how does the trajectory of this change, if at all, once we see the improved supplies -- tuberculin for the skin test to come back in the market? And then if you have any sort of update or guesstimate as to when we might actually see that old technology coming back? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Once people have started using QuantiFERON, we typically don't see them flipping back, because the ease of administration and the hospital network, the quality of the product, the digital output, it just makes it so much easier for the physicians. So from that perspective, you might lose a few back to TST, but there's no cost advantages, certainly no clinical advantage and there's absolutely no administrative or workflow advantage of using the skin test. And so we think that's -- the majority is here to stay. The same is true also with competitive wins, laboratories, service labs or alternative products are used due to low availability of our product or other where we had some supply issues in Japan, for instance. We're quite convinced that we can move that back very quickly. We -- also, we're on the process now, final process, of moving into China, and these are big markets for these products that we are looking forward to address. So there's a lot of runway, and we don't think that customers, once they see our benefits, are open to -- into going back to the old world. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division Got it. And if I can sneak just one last one in here, Peer. You mentioned that Japan, the academic overall was flattish there. At least one of your competitors has talked about the -- potentially the early stages or resurgence in academic funding over there. Can you just talk to that geography, in general? And then I guess, specifically, kind of how are you're looking at that either in the fourth quarter, maybe more about longer-term 2014, 2015 outlook? Peer M. Schatz Yes, it's a good question, and you're putting us a little bit on the spot here because we all know that there is a very significant uptick that could be expected for many of these stimulus funding. The problem is timing and calling that, and we've seen that so often in Japan and we have been burned a few times by expecting lost pass [ph] or this or this to happen. And it's sometimes quite opaque [ph] when and how these things get implemented. So our team tells us here at the moment that they're not seeing any material inflows at all, and there's still a lot of uncertainty if and when this will come. And when we say, look, it's being fantastic and it's now -- seems to be firm. And the answer comes back, nothing is firm at the moment. So we'll believe it when we see the money, and we haven't seen the money yet. Operator And the next question is from Mr. Brian Weinstein from William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division My question is on the investments that you've made in bioinformatics. They've been impressive and I think they make a lot of sense. How specifically do you monetize these investments when you have everything integrated? And then how does SAP, your relationship there, continue to play into things? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Brian. And I'm sorry, Tycho, I forgot also the SAP question, so I'll bundle that into the answer here. The business models of selling bioinformatics on a stand-alone basis are difficult. And if you look at the stand-alone business models, it is difficult to see a lot of value generation in this market. The value really comes from creating a platform and a delivery vehicle. And for us, that is not the sequencer. It is actually the assay. So the important thing in the workflow is the assay. The detection can be generic and our assays, for instance, run on most available sequencers. They invent the bioinformatics and we can get a premium on the price of the assay by embedding bioinformatics. On the analysis side, we're simply making it easier to use our interpretation, as well, and also fewer [ph] are getting subscriptions or are able to create a nicer umbrella and framework for the sample team-type [ph] workflow regardless of the detection system. That is critical. We're pretty agnostic as to that. We have a very, very good sequencer coming up, but that's not the differentiating part of our NGS strategy alone. It is really also the availability of this -- of ability to monetize the strength in the workflow management bioinformatics through integration with that chemistry that are universally applicable. We are currently in discussion with SAP on implementation of their HANA technology, which allows ultrafast analyses of unstructured data bases. We've been kind of holding off on that due to -- until we have clarity around the CLC the acquisition which we now have, and with the analysis framework now as part of our organization. We are accelerating these discussions to see how we can use that powerful new technology for our analysis solutions. Operator Our next question is from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division So I had, I guess, a couple of questions on HPV. As you noted, U.S. HPV declined about 10% year-over-year. But if I'm doing the math right, it appears that U.S. HPV revenue is actually stable in Q3 relative to Q2 levels. It may have even improved a little bit sequentially. So could you discuss what's happening today and what you expect to happen moving forward? You talked about pricing in your prepared remarks, but it would be interesting to hear a little bit more about that, as well as what's going on in terms of share and the impact of testing intervals. And I guess, looking ahead, is there a level where you would expect U.S. HPV's revenue to bottom out? Again, it seemed like you had an okay quarter. Does it seem like U.S. HPV revenue could kind of bottom out and stay at the high-20s levels on a quarterly basis? Peer M. Schatz On the high-20s levels... Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I'm sorry, high like $20 million to $30 million. Peer M. Schatz U.S. HPV? Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division Yes. Peer M. Schatz Oh, okay. Well, in general, you're absolutely right. The third quarter definitely had a nice development on HPV on a number of different fronts, and we are quite successful in bringing forward or highlighting our clinical advantages. The publications that are coming out, we're not really announcing those now through the [ph] Street, but I mean, customers are clearly seeing a lot of news come out on alternative testing approaches, PCR or other amplification technologies that are just showing very, very poor results and -- especially in screening programs. So we are in a good position there and are holding our market share quite nicely. Unfortunately, a lot of labs are under cost pressures, so -- which means quite desperate pricing approaches by some of the competitors that we, at least partly have to also accommodate our pricing. And so pricing has definitely come down considerably. Volumes have actually been quite solid. The outlook going forward for the U.S. HPV market is -- were pulling on track. We set x genotyping to have in '14 2/3 of the market, maybe 70%, but that's something we still believe is possible. Now if you look at some of the doomsday predictions we saw 2 or 3 years ago, that's almost twice as high. We definitely see that there will continue, however, to be a decline in revenues, probably through -- at least through '15, and that will probably be at the same pace that we're currently seeing. X U.S. is a totally different story. We are -- because if you don't have liquid cytology as an adjunct test, our test blows away anything else in the marketplace, hands down, because it's an easier workflow, much faster and much easier to perform. And so from that perspective, x U.S. will continue to have a lot of opportunities over the next few years. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division And maybe my follow-up related to the last comment, it does look like o U.S. HPV revenue increased by something like $5 million from Q2 to Q3. Is that a sign of demand really picking up along the lines of what you just described? Or is there something along the lines of a tender being pulled forward, or is this truly just a sign of fundamental demand picking up? Peer M. Schatz Fundamental demand is definitely quite interesting, but these deals are quite lumpy. There's always been the purchase of an [indiscernible] inventory level [indiscernible] when this is planned or so, it will definitely be something that will be a little bit more volatile on a revenue base. Roland, do you want to comment on that? Roland Sackers No, no, more or less exactly what you said. As you said, we had a good quarter. In third quarter, we won a couple of tenders, and typically these tenders start with, also, a larger shipment. It's beginning nevertheless. It is typically tenders going for a few years or so. Operator And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Just, Roland, when you start going to including stock comp in your '14 guidance, is the $37 million you're looking at in 2013, is that a reasonable number to think about for next year? Roland Sackers Excellent question, and it's clearly one of the focus points on our Analyst Day to give you some more insight and break-ups that you have a comparable base, and we all talk about apples to apples for 2014 [indiscernible] compensation but also other charges. So I'll give you more insight on Analyst Day, and happy, as you know, to welcome you there. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. Also Roland, can you give us some general split between where Ingenuity was in the different buckets? Just some general guidance on the revenues. Are we going to have apples-to-apples organic current, new [ph] growth rate for the businesses? Roland Sackers Yes, as I said on the call, it's really Molecular in Life Science and in Pharma, where just to give a rough indication, it's probably 1/4 in Molecular. And so right now, again, it might be different in a different quarter, 1/4 in the last quarter in Molecular and the rest in Life Science. [indiscernible] together, to be precise. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Great. Just one quick one if I can squeeze it in. Peer, what's the turnaround time on your CT/NG test? And when you think about the strategy in the U.S., is the QIAsymphony a moderate or high complexity platform? Peer M. Schatz Oh, Derik, the latter one is a very interesting question. If you look at it, the QIAsymphony -- in the modular version that we have today, which is actually the preferred [indiscernible] for LDT customers and people using a broad range of menu, they don't want to have an integrated system. They actually prefer a modular system. But for CT/NG or some other assays, an integrated system is a preferred route, and the symphony was always designed as a modular system with the option to fully integrate the detection. If you would do that, in theory, you could think about a moderate complexity system that seems to fulfill all of the specifications to get there. And so this is putting -- this is definitely a very interesting question you're asking, and some -- one that we're spending time on. In terms of the system, that the turnaround time, [indiscernible] I'd have to get back to you on that one. I don't have that data here right now. But maybe that's one we could ask at Analyst Day. It is definitely a very competitive assay. John Gilardi So with that, I'd like to close the conference call and thank all of you for your participation.

Hello, and welcome to our conference call today to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2013 and for the full year, and also to provide you with perspectives on our goals for 2014. We are pleased with the results for 2013, having delivered our communicated targets. The achievements of 2013 show the progress we are making to accelerate innovation and growth, especially by focusing on our 5 growth drivers. With QIAsymphony, the first growth driver, we are expanding the test menu. We recently completed a 510(k) submission in the United States for the C. difficile assay, which detects bacterial infection that is a growing problem in healthcare facilities. We also have sought U.S. clearance for the QIAsymphony complete workflow, and we are working on a number of other potential submissions for 2014. This breakthrough automation platform, QIAsymphony, is setting new standards, and we have set a new goal for at least 250 new placements in 2014. In Personalized Healthcare, we have reached several new agreements for co-development projects with growing interest from pharmaceutical companies following the U.S. regulatory approval of our therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic kit in July. Uptake of our companion diagnostics is improving in the United States following progress on reimbursement issues. We are pleased with the premium pricing achieved with our evidence-based reimbursement strategy. The second of our 5 growth drivers is QuantiFERON-TB, which is the modern Gold standard for detection of latent tuberculosis. This product has a strong growth profile and is set to exceed $100 million of sales in 2014. We are expanding this franchise's global presence and are preparing for an important launch in China this year. Two of our growth drivers involve our next-generation sequencing initiative. Our ambition is to offer broad portfolio of products and services to drive the use of this breakthrough technology in clinical research and diagnostics. We have a 2-pronged approach. First, we are offering many products as universal solutions that can be used with any sequencing platform or data. An important initiative for 2014 will be to accelerate the growth of this expanding portfolio, which also includes industry-leading sample technologies. Second, we are advancing our own next-generation sequencing benchtop sequencer workflow, which will use these products as well, but integrate them into a seamless work stream, as we say, from sample to insight. On the GeneReader NGS workflow, we are moving ahead with development and our plans for commercialization in 2014. A key achievement of 2013 was becoming the industry leader in commercial bioinformatics, which is one of our 5 growth drivers, through the combination of Ingenuity and CLC bio with our own activities. We are establishing an important foundation for growth by offering gold standard solutions to transform complex data generated by any sequencer into valuable molecular insights. Bioinformatics is a market segment set for dynamic growth, and we are anticipating significant incremental sales contributions in 2014 and beyond. Turning to 2014, I would like to share some initial perspectives. As you know, we expect increasing headwinds from the HPV product portfolio in the United States, which continues to face competitor-driven pricing pressure. A topic for 2014 is the nonexclusive switch of a U.S. reference laboratory to a competitor product portfolio in addition to ours. So after 2 percentage points of sales headwind in 2013, we currently expect a sales headwind in 2014 of about 4 percentage points from the U.S. HPV portfolio. At the same time, remember that we are anticipating a solid business expansion from the rest of the portfolio of about 8% to 9% on a constant exchange rate basis and that are our top growth drivers. So this leads to our guidance, for about 5% -- 4% to 5% constant exchange rate growth in adjusted net sales for 2014. If we look into 2015, we expect the bottoming out of the U.S. HPV screening revenues. And we can see an exciting impact from our strong focus on attractive long-term growth drivers in the years to come. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in 2013, a year with challenging macroeconomic trends and key actions to transform QIAGEN and strengthen our capabilities. We look forward to accelerating the pace of innovation and growth in 2014 and delivering improved results. And on Slide 5, to provide an overview of results for our 4 customer classes. All of the customer classes delivered growth for the year led by Molecular Diagnostics and Applied Testing, while Ingenuity and CLC bio provided first-time revenues in all customer classes as well. As I mentioned earlier, we continue to place QIAsymphony systems and generate double-digit growth in consumable sales. These involve primarily products from our profiling infectious disease portfolio. Contribution from instrument sales, however, were lower in 2013, and this is due to how the revenue from instrument placements is deferred over a multiyear period in QIAsymphony reagent rental agreements. In Prevention, the QuantiFERON latent TB test continue to grow well above 20% on a constant exchange rate basis and eclipse our target with robust demand in the United States, while we have benefit from shortages [ph] of the 120-year old skin test. Personalized Healthcare is another growth driver, and here we saw mixed results. Sales of companion diagnostic kits were higher, but revenues from Pharma co-development projects were down significantly compared to 2012, and they were especially lower in the fourth quarter of 2013. We have said before that the timing of these revenues can be volatile, but are anticipating higher revenues in 2014. We're also very pleased that we signed a record number of agreements with pharma companies in 2013. In our HPV portfolio, where products are used to screen women for the human papillomavirus and the risk for cervical cancer, global sales declined 4% on a constant exchange rate basis in 2013 and provided about 16% of total sales. Here we have a differentiated picture as well with sales in the United States down at a double-digit pace in line with our expectation and creating about 2 percentage points of headwind on total QIAGEN sales. But at the same time we saw solid double-digit constant exchange rate growth in the rest of the world where we have done extremely well in winning business from screening programs. In the Life Sciences, all customer classes grew despite challenging macroeconomic trends. Applied Testing sales grows at a mid-single-digit constant exchange rate basis, returning to growth during the second half of the year and overcoming the tough comparison to the outstanding QIAsymphony instrument revenues in 2012. Pharma grew at a low single-digit constant exchange rate, and this was supported by the bioinformatics acquisitions. Trends were challenging in this area during the fourth quarter of the year as well, with the impact of Pharma industry productivity initiatives and restructuring activities weighing on growth. Academia sales were under pressure during the year, given the U.S. and European funding environment, and the bioinformatics contributions were important to delivering growth. As for 2014, we anticipate better overall funding trends, but the 2014 levels are still below those seen in previous years. I would like now to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Yes. Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I'm now on Slide 6, and would like to review our results for the year. Adjusted net sales were USD 1.306 billion, and we're up 5% at constant exchange rates, which was in line with our goal of 5% constant exchange rate growth. While adjusted earnings per share were USD 1.14, and up our target of USD 1.13. About half of the sales growth came from Ingenuity and CLC bio, while the other higher half comes from the rest of the portfolio. Currency movements had an adverse impact of about 1 percentage point on reported results. As you have heard from other companies, some currencies significantly devaluated during the year against U.S. dollar, especially the Japanese yen, Brazilian real and the Turkish lira, which are countries where we have important sales operations, but few operating costs. And this is weighted on our operating results. However, this was offset by the currency gains on balance sheet positions which are reported below EBIT. Adjusted operating income was largely unchanged at about USD 355 million, and the adjusted operating income margin declined to about 27% of sales in 2013, compared to 28% in 2012. Keep in mind that we had said in the investment in bioinformatics, which is a key foundation for future growth, which results in near-term dilution of about 100 basis points for 2013, and also some margin dilution in 2014 as well. We also made significant investments in reallocated resources during the year to support R&D sales and marketing initiatives, focus on all of our 5 growth drivers. As you know, we also completed a major efficiency and effectiveness project in 2013. And we are determined to reap the benefits through improving profitability and have set targets for margin expansions in 2014 and in the coming years. Adjusted net income rose 6% for the year to USD 275.1 million, and this included some revenues from technology licenses. The adjusted tax rate was 20% for the year, which was in line with our target. And now on Slide 7, to give you an overview on our regional performance in 2013 with all regions delivering growth. About half of our sales was in the Americas, where there was 5% constant exchange rates for the year. Strong demand for the QuantiFERON-TB test led to overall positive single-digit growth in the U.S., which more than compensated for the accepted drop in HPV sales and the Academia conditions. Large customer orders in Latin America for HPV screening also supported the performance. In Europe, adjusted net sales rose 2% constant exchange rate wise. Key contributors were countries in Northern and Western Europe, with Molecular Diagnostics and Applied Testing leading the regional performance. We delivered double-digit growth at the top 7 emerging markets, which together grew 24% and provided about 14% of adjusted net sales in 2013. Among the emerging market leaders are China and India, which led to the 6% constant exchange rate growth in the Asia-Pacific/Japan region. I want to note here that sales were largely unchanged in Japan at constant exchange rates for the year, and we have not seen signs of the government stimulus funding yet. I'm now on Slide 8 and will provide some comments on consumables and instruments. Consumables and other revenues were 6% constant exchange rate in 2013 and provided about 88% of sales. We are seeing an ongoing shift in the product mix towards consumables and our expectations for rapid growth in bioinformatics further supports this trend. Revenues from instruments contributed about 12% of sales, and we are down 4% constant exchange rate from 2012. After the improving trends in the first 3 quarters of the year, instrument sales unfortunately turned lower in the fourth quarter as adverse funding trends weighted on capital projects such as Academia and Applied Testing customer classes. Instrument sales in Molecular Diagnostics were also down slightly for the year and faced a tough comparison against double-digit constant exchange rate growth in 2012. At the same time, we are very pleased to achieve our targets for QIAsymphony placements and to deliver solid growth in consumables. I'm now on Slide 9 to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted net sales were up 5% at constant exchange rates, which was in line with our target for around 5% to 6% growth, while adjusted EPS of $0.36 was ahead of the target for $0.35 a share. Our entry into bioinformatics has been very successful, with Ingenuity and CLC providing about 3 percentage points of growth and the rest of the business providing about 2 percentage points. We saw solid gains among our 5 growth drivers, and our global HPV franchise absorbed lower sales in the U.S. However, we also saw a sharp decline in Pharma co-development partnership revenues and weak instrument sales against a tough comparison a year ago. Adjusted operating income was largely unchanged at USD 106.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. And here again, we are making significant investments and also faced about 50 basis points of pressure in the 2013 quarter from adverse currency movements. Moving down the income statement, adjusted net income was 6% even against the higher tax rate compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. I'm now on Slide 10, with an update on our financial position. As of December 31, 2013, we had liquidity of about USD 380 million. And our net debt was at a reasonable level of USD 482 million. Leverage has moved up slightly to about 1.1x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, compared to 0.9 at the end of 2012. We see QIAGEN is continuing to have a healthy financial position, one that provides flexibility to support business expansion as well to increase returns to shareholders. Our cash flow performance has improved during the year with QIAGEN generating USD 259 million of operating cash flow in 2013, and also higher free cash flows than in 2012. This has to be seen in light of the restructuring charges taken in 2013, which had an adverse cash impact of about USD 65 million for the year. But given that we completed our restructuring project, we are targeting to significantly improve cash flows in 2014, which is in line with our ambition to double operating cash flow in the midterm. I would like to now hand it back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 11 to provide some insights on implementing our strategy with the ambition of accelerating innovation and growth. Our strategy is anchored on expanding our leadership in Sample & Assay Technologies that address the rapidly evolving needs of customers to transform biological samples into valuable molecular insights. These 5 growth drivers address the critical needs of many customers across these classes and are driving the dissemination of molecular technologies. First we are driving global adoption of the QIAsymphony platform and expanding the menu of test content. We are also extending QIAGEN's leadership in Personalized Healthcare with innovative companion diagnostics, and we're also establishing the QuantiFERON-TB test as the modern gold standard for latent tuberculosis control. Our last 2 growth drivers are emerging very quickly. We are expanding the use of bioinformatics in molecular applications, particularly through the investments we are making after the Ingenuity and CLC bio acquisitions in 2013 and creating an industry-leading portfolio to drive use of commercial next-generation sequencing in clinical research and diagnostics, areas where there are still significant bottlenecks holding back the adoption. I'm now on Slide 12 to provide some perspectives here on the guidance we have given for 2014. Now the 5 growth drivers are driving the transformation of QIAGEN. As you see on this slide, adjusted net sales were about $1.306 billion in 2013. I mentioned earlier that we are anticipating about 4 percentage points of headwind from lower sales of HPV products in the U.S, and this is about double the headwind from 2013 of about 2 percentage points. We see 2014 as the year U.S. HPV sales fell well below of 10% of net sales. At the same time, we are anticipating about 8% to 9% constant exchange rate growth from the rest of the business, and this leads to the guidance of about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate growth. This shows the underlying strength of the overall QIAGEN business. As we have said before, this does not include any sales contributions from the planned launch of the GeneReader NGS benchtop workflow in 2014. Here are the points to consider on the growth drivers. QIAsymphony is providing about a percentage point of incremental sales growth to QIAGEN. QuantiFERON is set to break through $100 million of sales in 2014, surpassing the size of our U.S. HPV franchise. Personalized Healthcare generates more than $100 million of sales and is growing at a good double-digit constant exchange rate pace. And bioinformatics is set to be an important incremental contributor in 2014 as Ingenuity and CLC bio provide large incremental growth. As for the rest of our portfolio beyond the growth drivers, the improving environment for Life Science funding in the United States, and also partly in Europe, as well as our expanding global presence gives additional support to this guidance. However, as always, there are also risks in 2014 and this year especially in terms of the timing for incremental funding improvements in the United States, since these are more weighted towards the second half of the year. We're also closely monitoring currency trends, which are currently expected to have an adverse impact on net sales and earnings in 2014. In the next few slides, I will provide an update on our 5 growth drivers. Slide 13 shows an overview of the rapid expansion of our QIAsymphony automation platform, which broke through 1,000 cumulative placements during 2013. We have set a goal for about 250 new placements in '14, and again, in 2015, as well as to deliver double-digit consumables growth. We are pleased with the pace of placements, but the focus today is on the success to expand the menu. In December, our teams completed 2 important U.S. submissions. First, they completed a 510(k) for clearance of the artus C. difficile QIAsymphony RGQ Kit for detection of Clostridium difficile, a bacterial infection that is increasingly becoming a public health challenge in the United States and in many other countries. Second, we submitted the complete QIAsymphony RGQ MDx platform to the FDA for clearance. And here, I mean the SP, sample processing and the AS, assay setup units along with the Rotor-Gene MDx PCR platform, which already received clearance in 2012. These are important steps to increase the utility of QIAsymphony for customers and builds on the FDA approvals of our therascreen KRAS and therascreen EGFR companion diagnostic assays. We're also expanding the menu in Europe, where more than 20 assays are offered on the QIAsymphony RGQ. The RespiFinder RG panel was recently launched in Europe. This is a novel Multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection and differentiation of 21 respiratory pathogens, and it is the first highly multiplex pathogen assay designed to run on Rotor-Gene Q. This is strengthening competitive profile of QIAsymphony in addressing the more urgent care testing needs of our customers. We also intend to have more test menus for you in 2014. Among submissions planned for the year are U.S. application for artus HSV 1/2; QIAsymphony RGQ Kit for diagnosis of Herpes simplex virus 1/2; and also in U.S. and European applications for healthcare associated infections from Vancomycin resistant bacteria with the artus [ph] QIAsymphony RGQ Kit; and MRSA infections with the artus MRSA QIAsymphony RGQ Kit. I'm now on Slide 14. Building up our leadership in Personalized Healthcare has many different elements, and one of these is helping our customers gain better access to biological samples to support the care of patients. We are already the leader in providing sample technologies required for pre-circulating DNA test, in particular noninvasive prenatal screening tests. And we recently made an announcement -- an important announcement in this area in expanding our partnership with Exosome Diagnostics to develop noninvasive molecular diagnostics that provide access to molecular insights contained in exosomes. These are microvesicles that can be isolated from biofluids such as blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid, and from which high quality RNA and DNA can be extracted and purified for analysis. They're a key part of the body's complex communication system that transfers genetic instructions from cell to cell. Physicians are clearly looking for better ways to analyze and monitor disease progress, and they steer treatments that rely on tissue biopsies. Using exosomes can also provide them with insights along the entire continuum of patient care, not just when tissue samples can be accessed, for instance, in biopsies. The advancements in harvesting exosomes are moving ahead rapidly, and we see an opportunity with this collaboration to shift the paradigm in gaining access to molecular information. As part of this collaboration, which we announced last July, the first of the new sample technology kits are scheduled to be launched in 2014. These will allow researchers, drug developers and doctors to take repeated realtime genetic snapshots of disease from patients by examining exosomes without the need for tissue biopsy. The samples are designed to run on PCR, pyrosequencing and next-generation sequencing technologies. We further expanded the collaboration in January of this year to develop the first-in-class, blood-based test to detect certain mutations of an undisclosed gene associated with non-small cell lung cancer and other malignancies. The assay will have the potential to be paired with several new anticancer therapies. We have worldwide exclusive commercialization rights and intend to submit the test for regulatory approvals. Moving to Slide 15, we have been highlighting QuantiFERON-TB as one of our growth drivers. An important goal for 2014 is targeting new markets with our QuantiFERON TB test for latent tuberculosis, and we are preparing to launch in China this year. This expansion comes after having established clear market leadership in the United States and Europe for the modern egra [ph] latent TB tests. This entry into China is admittedly later than it should have been, given the opportunities here, but we are now there and are now ramping up market development activities in the top cities and targeting the main TB risk groups. As for the size of this market, some estimates are out there that more than 50 million skin tests are done each year in China. This is certainly not indicative of the market potential for modern latent TB testing, but there are substantial opportunities in the well-funded hospitals, and this could translate near term into several million dollars of sales. In addition to geographic markets, we are targeting expansion into new customer market segments as well. An increasing topic of discussion is the risk for latent TB infections developing into an active disease in people with Type 2 diabetes. As you see on the slide, a few recent examples of how TB outbreaks are affecting daily lives, in this case the collection of recent instance in the United States. This underscores the fact that TB remains a significant modern public health issue and the need for modern tests such as QuantiFERON-TB to help in the fight against the disease. Moving to Slide 16, enabling access to valuable molecular information through exosomes plays into the emerging growth drivers in bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing solutions. As I mentioned earlier, we are moving ahead on these initiatives that are anchored by our ambition to enable our customers to rapidly transform very complex data generated from any biological sample into valuable molecular insights. A key area of focus are clinical research and diagnostic workflows, where there are bottlenecks blocking the adoption of sequencing technologies particularly in Sample Technologies and bioinformatics. We are pursuing a 2-pronged commercialization strategy. First, a broad range of products and services, and this includes universal solutions that can be used with any sequencer or with any sequence data. And second, the complete sample to insight GeneReader NGS benchtop workflow that is in development. On this slide, you see the breadth and depth of the portfolio we are developing, and this will be a key part of our story at the upcoming AGBT conference at Marco Island. We will be highlighting the expansion of our universal products such as new sample technologies to improve single cell sequencing, a range of new gene panels that goes beyond just cancer, and new bioinformatics solutions designed to improve data analysis and interpretation. In terms of the new bioinformatics solutions, we see this is a key differentiator and essential to creating seamless solutions for our customers that help to create even greater value in the Life Sciences drug development and clinical diagnostics. Doing so will position QIAGEN as a unique player in this segment. No other supplier has a workflow covering this complete workflow, especially in terms of the dry lab bioinformatics. We view bioinformatics as a differentiating, value-creating product, particularly if you ask customers in clinical research and diagnostics. The quality of our products stands out well ahead of the competition, and the choice of bioinformatics has a major impact on the quality of analysis and interpretation. Even the smallest differences in the quality and accuracy of the bioinformatics can lead to significantly different outcomes. So we see our rapidly growing bioinformatics' activities is providing a sustainable competitive advantage for years. On GeneReader, our teams are moving ahead on the development working on creating the first seamless workflow from biological samples through to interpreted data analysis and interpretation of the highest quality. We'll keep you updated on our progress and plans for commercialization in 2014. With that, I would like to now hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. I'm now on Slide 17 to review our guidance for 2014 and also for the first quarter of the year. As you know, a new adjustment policy takes effect with the reporting of results for the first quarter of 2014. First, share-based compensation will be included as a cost in adjusted results. Second, cost for restructuring will only be adjusted for results related to business integration and acquisition-related activities. This comparable figures for 2013, that include share-based compensation expenses, are provided in the appendix of this presentation. In terms of guidance for the full year, as mentioned earlier, we are expecting total sales growth of about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate-wise. This is based on expectations for declining U.S. HPV product sales to create a headwind of about 4 percentage points in 2014, but for the rest of the business to grow about 8% to 9% constant exchange rate-wise. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow at a faster pace than adjusted net sales. And our goal is for at least 100 basis points of margin improvement to a level of about 26 percentage points. This is from a level about 24% for 2013 under the new adjusted -- adjustment policy. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to rise to approximately $1.07 to $1.09 for full year 2014, compared to $1.02 per share in 2013. And again, this includes share-based compensation for both years. This target for adjusted EPS is given at constant exchange rates since we see the risk based on current exchange rate trends for an adverse currency impact on our earnings in 2014 due to the volatility in currencies where we have sales, but very low cost basis [ph]. As mentioned earlier, these are partly [ph] in Japan and Turkey, but also Brazil and Australia. For the first quarter of 2014, adjusted net sales are expected to rise about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate-wise and for $0.21 to $0.22 per share of adjusted EPS, also at constant exchange rates. The expectations do not take into account any acquisitions that could be completed in 2014. This slide also contains assumptions for adjustment to results for the first quarter of 2014 and also for the full year. For the full year of 2014, we expect the following: about USD 120 million for amortization of acquired intellectual property; about USD 10 million to USD 15 million for business integration acquisition items, and this is part of the new adjustment policy; and an adjusted tax rate of about 19% to 21%, which compares to about 19% in 2013 under the new adjustment policy. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 18 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. We are pleased with our performance in 2013. We achieved our targets for improved sales and adjusted earnings growth in all customer classes and regions and made significant progress on strategic initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth. This commitment to improving sales growth is accompanied by a focus in improving earnings and cash flow as well, and also improving returns as we move forward, for instance, with the completion of our second $100 million share repurchase program. Let me review what we have announced. We achieved our communicated targets for the fourth quarter and full year in terms of sales and adjusted earnings growth. Our 5 growth drivers are gaining momentum. We have made significant progress on building the test menu and securing placements of the QIAsymphony automation platform, signing new co-development agreements in Personalized Healthcare, and developing new technologies to gain access to valuable molecular insights, driving the ongoing strong expansion of the QuantiFERON latent TB test and delivering rapid growth as we develop our capabilities in bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing technologies. In closing, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for 2014, and we'll fulfill our mission of making improvements in life possible. And with that, I'd like to hand back to the operator to open up for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I'm going to ask a couple quickly here. Just first, on the decline in instrument placements, both within applied and pharma, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that? We see pretty strong results from a couple of your peers. Second on QuantiFERON, any color on just the assumptions for Japan and China for this year? And then the timing of a fourth [ph] skin test? And then lastly, GeneReader, you talked a lot about it, we've seen some interesting innovation in the market, obviously it's a big market opportunity. When can we actually start to see some data on the GeneReader? Peer M. Schatz Sure. I'll take the latter 2 questions. And Roland, if you could follow-up then with the first on the automation. So in terms of QuantiFERON Japan, we had a challenging year 2013, as we had said before, it was quite volatile in terms of our ability to further convert the market, but we have been able to create now the foundation from which we expect strong growth in 2014 to continue. The growth in -- so we expect a much better year in QuantiFERON in Japan, which is by the way, the second largest market in the world for this, for latent TB testing. In China, we expect a very good uptake. We've done numerous studies already validating our technology and the key decision-makers there clearly have been highlighting our technology as the one of choice to move forward on. And this is evidenced by strong support that we've been receiving also in advance now of the formal approval, which we expect any day now. So that definitely is a substantial market opportunity. At the same time, we see no slowing down across the other regions in the uptake and are addressing one segment after the other and adding new opportunities constantly. So we expect QuantiFERON to do very well in 2014. And as you pointed out before, there are a number of new products around the TB franchise, but also additional targets for the QuantiFERON technology that we will be talking about, for instance, the CMV test that is already launched in Europe is doing very well and addressing a very interesting niche and very synergistic with other products. The second -- the last question you had was the GeneReader portfolio. So in the course -- during the course of 2013, we had the product out there with select customers in early testing. We're now working on integrating all of these components that we have into a complete sample to insight workflow. And this is what we really want to demonstrate to the market, is not the performance of the individual components but the complete workflow. And this is something that we will -- we expect to be able to launch over the course of 2014. We are not being more specific on timing at this point. Roland Sackers Yes, answer to your first question on implementation and growth rates here. First of all, we -- just to remind you, we clearly had a very strong fourth quarter 2012, the instrument sales are actually up 7%, and that was clearly very focused on QIAsymphony. And if you recall, what we said also over the course of the year, we clearly have seen a shift in terms of customer QIAsymphony placements in terms of how customers are going to buy these instruments. We see more and more customers going for, what we call, reagent [ph] models, meaning, they don't pay the instrument upfront but rather pay it -- we are a long-term commitment in consumables and an increased consumable price. It's still a trend which continues and that clearly had an impact on the academic, especially on the Applied Testing market. So we see this is as a main driver for that tough comps on the one-hand side. More and more reagent [ph] vendors on the other-hand side. QIAsymphony is still -- is a very successful very good placement numbers also in the fourth quarter, also the reason why we set another ambition goal for 2014, just 250-plus placements. And I think it is something that we feel quite comfortable with as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citigroup. Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Roland, I guess, can you just elaborate on the '14 guidance and more specifically on where the operating margin expansion is going to come from, particularly gross margin, R&D, SG&A? And then for Peer, Japan, you said no impact from stimulus, it's a little contrary to what we've heard from others. Do you have any confidence in terms of market share in Japan? Can you make any comments there, a potential loss if that's happening at all? Roland Sackers Let me start off with the question. On the gross margin side, I do believe the gross margin on a normalized basis around 71, 71.5, I think, is a kind of an area where we feel quite comfortable. Given the overall changes we talked about in this call so far on HPV and the other growth drivers. So I think that is a fair assumption that gross margins stays in that kind of an area. We do expect, on the other hand, significant leverage coming out of SG&A, clearly the area where we did a lot of changes over the last 12 to 18 months. Just recall what we did on setting up shared-service center, closing down smaller-sized clearly also will fluctuate our different sales channels. I would say that it's an area where we do expect leverage to come from R&D. It's an area where we believe spending somewhere between 11% and 12% of revenue is the right level of investment into our innovation, an area we feel quite comfortable with on the one-hand side, fueling very nicely our innovation pipeline, on the other hand giving us a very nice output on the same time. So all in, that clearly means that our EBIT margin for 2014 has to go at least 100 basis points. And so we feel also given our midterm goal of around 250 basis points that we see already here quite a significant part of that in the -- over the course of 2014. Peer M. Schatz All right. Let me see, the question on Japan, we -- obviously we know about the stimulus funding being implemented now. We also see how it is moving through to the bureaucracy. It depends on what segment you look at, how quickly the available funding does move through the bureaucracy of the actual spending organization, and academia is certainly quite a bit slower. And there's also -- there you also have to see how the healthcare system is designed in Japan. This is -- either it is private or it is also these rather large organizations. We're still waiting for the trickle-down to actually hit the purchasing organizations. And this is pretty much consensus across the direct peers in these various customer classes and product groups that we are active in. So we're benchmarking clearly against our peer group over the past few years, and we have always been in the top category in terms of growth. We expect this also for 2013, even though that was a difficult year in Japan for the complete community. We actually -- as per the intelligence we have -- we actually did quite well in comparison. And so in the classes that we have, we believe we held or actually gained market share in key areas. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division One on financials and one on next-generation sequencing, if I may. And starting off with the financial question on the operating cash flow, how should we see the intended doubling of the operating cash flows? It's a linear process of the next 3 years and particularly referring to 2014. And I would assume that the basis of 2013 plus the USD 65 million in negative -- a negative impact from restructurings, all under this -- this would come on top at least for 2014. And also maybe how should we expect CapEx going forward here? And on next-generation sequencing, I would like to refer to Slide 16 of your presentation. And then I have a question on the sample preparation kits that you're about to launch. How should we see the adoption of them? Is it that customers will likely wait potentially for the GeneReader to come? And do you expect them to sell quite well separately already, and who would use them right now? Any more color there would certainly help me. Roland Sackers Yes, Daniel, in terms of cash flow, as you said on the one-hand side, we do have a midterm goal of doubling our operating cash flow and on the other hand, we clearly have seen here a larger impact in 2013 as well. We still have a smaller number of payouts in 2014. So it's a quote [ph] in our P&L in 2013, but they're still around, I guess, $10 million, $15 million, which we have to pay out this year so affecting cash flow, but is a small amount in general terms. I do believe that we will see similar to what you see on EBIT margin improvement. We see that impact also in cash flow improvements so that this year should be more than a linear approach. We are able to reap off in terms of benefits. And that is a good starting point for going behind. So we did a lot of things in terms of working capital improvement. As you recall, we changed our logistic setup. We're working now with a global provider, very helpful also in inventory turnover. At the same time, we believe that we had quite a significant changes in SG&A, also the way we address our customers, which are more efficient and therefore should give us also cash benefits. So I would say, as I said, better than linear. Peer M. Schatz Second question, Daniel, was regarding what we call the universal solutions. We actually have an interesting position in next-generation sequencing is that we are already present in basically every single laboratory that is doing next-generation sequencing around the world, through the fact that we solved the upfront sample preparation part. Now if you look at next-gen sequencing, people often talk about sample preparation, but they are using the term for a different step in the process. We typically call sample preparation what you see here also on the list is transforming a raw biological sample into an analyzable nucleic acid. This is the purification and also the whole genome amplification, or whole exomes amplification or transcriptome amplification solutions that we have. This is -- here for instance, the whole transcriptome single cell kit, would follow the purification of the nucleic acid. And that's a step that we typically call sample preparation. What other people call sample preparation is typically then the target enrichment, the library preparation steps and basically the whole process following purified amplified DNA into the sequencer. The -- those -- what we call sample preparation steps are ones that we obviously have an extremely strong position in and in particular in the clinical arena, where degraded samples are used, and it is very challenging to go from a clinical sample into an analyzable nucleic acid. So from that perspective, we are simply adding to that portfolio the target enrichment of the library preparation steps. Target enrichment are basically the assays that we're talking about. We have a very broad offering and also have a new generation of these panels coming out this year, with a number of improved specifications and building on the diagnostic assay development capabilities that we have here at the company. The same is also true with the bioinformatics. So there's no need to wait for the complete workflow. We have a workflow that will be adoptable in the segment of the market, but have an extremely strong offering for the whole market. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So on the C. difficile assay that you submitted, I guess, a couple of questions. First of all, how many QIAsymphonys are in position in the hospital laboratories to basically use the test? I'm just trying to get a view here -- 1,000 installed base of QIAsymphony, how many of them are positioned to benefit from your molecular [ph] diagnostics menu? Peer M. Schatz I'll have to check the exact number, but we have about 2/3 of the systems in Molecular Diagnostic laboratories, of which at least 1/2, if not more, would be target opportunities for the C. diff assay. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And as you go for FDA approval of the whole QIAsymphony platform, do those customers need to do anything different to sort of get their QIAsymphony able to run the assay? Peer M. Schatz No, this is something that can be upgraded simply through the software that -- the software upgrades that we provided for the approved platform. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Great. And just a couple of housekeeping questions, Roland, if I missed I apologize. Share count guidance for '14 and net interest expense guidance? Roland Sackers Net interest expense more or less unchanged compared to what we had so far. Of course, adjusted for the interest rate on incoming cash flows, but unfortunately there's a rather big amount as we all know, and the share count is around 244 for the first quarter and 243 for the full year, given the actual share price on -- or based on the $24 basis. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of ISI Group. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division I guess, Peer, as you likely mentioned sort of given this year, the transition year for the [indiscernible] and HPV declines and as you reposition now the company for growth in the outskirts, you've got new products that's going to be key component of that strategy and as you look at the things you had sort of in the portfolio, I think one of your key competitor had a number of new product announcements earlier this year now, does it change anything at all from the way you're looking at that from your perspective and for [indiscernible] clinical NGS marketing. And I'll follow up on the HAI question earlier, again, while that's a strong double-digit growth market, it's also getting a little crowded. How do you think of the go-to-market strategy and pricing? Peer M. Schatz Sure, let me take the second question first. There are several players in C. diff and there are others coming in. We don't see C. diff as a differentiating feature. We think that based on the performance of our assets, we have the potential to have an industry-leading performance of the assays as well as content provision that our assay will be able to give the user, but it is really a menu play. And remember, we're going for a broad menu, this would mean that we're approaching 25 assays running on QIAsymphony RGQ in Europe, which we shouldn't forget is about 40% of the world's market and growing very, very fast for us and we see C. diff as an important addition. In the United States, fewer players are in the market than in Europe. It's a necessary menu item and one that has a high clinical need and broad utility. So there's several versions of the assays that go very near patient and others that go very high throughput, and we state [ph] a very, very interesting segment of the midrange hospital market, like Derik alluded to. Your first part of the question was the new product strategy. If you look at our company, we are not dependent on new product -- new products coming out. And I'd like to maybe just do a theoretical calculation. If you look at the guidance we're giving, it assumes that the underlying revenues of everything, with the exception of the HPV screening franchise, is growing at 8% to 9%. I don't know of too many other franchises that are doing that, and all of these growth drivers are very long term. So QIAsymphony is still at the beginning of its life cycle, its first 1/3, let's say. And QuantiFERON we just barely started, and Personalized Healthcare, same thing. They're all 100 million-plus franchises. Bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing, the same. So we're not -- we don't need any magic new product bullet to be able to show substantial growth. If we assume that we bought them out in terms of the HPV screening pricing declines in 2015, which I think is a fair assumption if you look at where the numbers are today, and you suddenly see that the 8% to 9% shine through, you can just imagine what happens to the overall growth profile of the company, and that's what we have always been working towards and what we've been preparing for long-term, long runway growth drivers that we can ultimately use to paint the overall growth profile or paint the overall profile of the company. In terms of next-generation sequencing portfolio, this is moving forward. It's an important part of our overall franchise, and we're quite excited about the opportunity to play in this area. But I'd like to stress again, we are not including any revenues from next-generation sequencing in our numbers, it is depending on the timing of the launch, it's depending on when we decide to move forward with the sample to insight offering. For now, we have excluded anything from the guidance in terms of revenues, and we clearly see an underlying strong growth engine of the 8% to 9% of the underlying business that will shine through by itself. And next-gen would be a very exciting addition to that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley, Research Division It's actually Michael Clerico on for Dan. Looking at increasing QIAsymphony placements, could you guys give us an update on the consumable pull-through, where it is currently and what the opportunity is? Also has the consumables factored into your 100-basis-point outlook for revenue contributions from QIAsymphony? Peer M. Schatz So we have 2 components in the QIAsymphony like revenue measurement, there's the core portfolio that are directly associated assays and sample technologies running in basically a samples [ph] to result mode, and then we have a large portfolio of assays that run on LDTs or using different downstream detection [Audio Gap] next-generation sequencing or so. The broader portfolio is driving a much higher growth rate than the 1%. The core portfolio is contributing 1% and growing into good double-digit pace. The outlook for or in terms of the pull-through, we're seeing increases, constant increases in pull-through, which is very different by region. The average is somewhere between 60,000 to 80,000 that we're running on the core assay portfolio. But in Europe, we're well into 6 digits with many customers running 200,000, 300,000 a year on the platform. And even at that rate, it is only -- it is not fully utilized. In the United States, with the LDT menu being the primary driver currently, we still are in the rate below the $80,000 range. And because we have very many placements in the United States, adding menu to the platform will allow us to quickly move the throughput also up there in that region. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Okay. Also in terms of doubling your operating cash flow, over what time frame do you think this could happen? How fast do you expect the initial inflection to occur given restructuring is largely behind you? Roland Sackers Yes, Michael, Roland. So what we believe is truly that we see already a larger impact clearly going to happen in 2014 for exactly that reason. And because -- also even -- when we invested significantly into growth drivers for the year 2014, it is clearly also something where we believe it increased returns in 2014 as well, so we'll see clearly a larger impact for the year 2014. Midterm, what we call, was 3 to 4 years, and again we will see more than linear impact over the course of 2014 going to happen. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jose Haresco of JMP Securities. Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division With regards to next-generation sequencing, there's obviously been a lot of product announcements over the last few weeks. Where is there still white space regards to specific applications, when you think about it below the population sequencing level? Is it exomes sequencing, is it in small labs, is it in certain types of academic labs? Or is it more on a regional basis? Peer M. Schatz Sure. First of all, it's a vast market opportunity. There's some very big numbers that have been put out there. Wouldn't even go that far in terms of the sizes, you just say that it's a large market opportunity that is synergistic to what we're doing today. So where we see the market opportunities is in simplification and dissemination. Most of these workflows are still tremendously complex. There's some very good solutions out there, but they still require very skilled operators and what we're trying to put forward is something that simplifies it and allows a higher sample throughput without the complexity of having to pool samples and batch them. So from that perspective, we are targeting the clinical research and the diagnostic markets. These are really core Qiagen turf, especially because of the complexity of the sample processing, the proximity to the diagnostics franchises, the requirement for high-quality reagents where you often manufactured under design control and high quality -- or developed under design control and manufactured under very stringent quality control systems. And this is something -- these areas that we think will have very differentiating capabilities. Sample throughput, also a need, for instance, in some of the more applied markets out there, but the big ones are for us at the clinical research and routine diagnostics markets. So this would be also typically everything exome and below in terms of capacity. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division A couple of questions. First off, Roland, it looks like the acquisition contribution, I believe, is about $12 million for the quarter. So one's just a simple accounting question, can you help us break out the split between the different operating groups there? And then secondly, and maybe for Peer, considering or looking at the diagnostic pipeline, obviously a number of different hospital acquired inspection [ph] test in there, can you talk a little bit about where MRSA is, or perhaps when that might flow in this pipeline as well? Roland Sackers Yes, on the fourth quarter, the acquisitions are split again over all 4 different business areas and customer segments. We clearly -- we see right now a little less than 1/2 in Academia, a larger amount in Pharma and then really split down between Applied Testing and Smaller Molecular, so I would say a little less than 1/2, probably 40%, 50% growth in Academia, then Pharma, then Applied Testing. Peer M. Schatz Great. Second part of the question was the hospital acquired menu. So we hope MRSA, first half, we are -- we also hope that MRSA is not a timeframe or a 2014 submission and the -- concurrently or a little bit before that CE marks. On top of that, I'd refer to the menu roadmap that we put out, for instance, in our Analyst Day, that has some details on when we expect those 2 to come forward. These are just a few of a broader menu that we actually have in development. We're working on about over 30 different projects right now. So there's a lot of development activity to expand the menu. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Capital. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Question on QIAsymphony, you mentioned the 250 placement goal for 2014. Just curious, how many of those are you expecting to be in the United States? And you mentioned 2/3 in molecular labs, can you break out how many of those 2/3 are in U.S.-based labs? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So we put a number -- it's about 50% to 60% are typically in the United States, of which about 2/3 in the States may be a tick higher, about 70% are in molecular labs. The -- so the presence is definitely heavily towards molecular and the U.S. has a very strong position in terms of placements. This is only on the LDTs. I think this is indicative of where we think it could go. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Great. And just as kind of a higher level follow-up question, you're mentioning the extraction part of the business earlier. I was just thinking or wondering how are you thinking about the growth of just that legacy [indiscernible] extraction business for 2014 as a piece of that 8% to 9%, or 8% or 9% growth in the core of the business? Peer M. Schatz Sure. It's actually quite differentiated. So there are -- just as an example of some of our instruments, we have about 180, 190 different protocols for different sample types and different applications. So in extremely differentiated -- it's not a very homogeneous requirement that our customers have. And that's one of our strengths, we have been able to solve all of their needs with very integrated solutions that are able to integrate a lot of protocols. We are seeing -- actually we have a targeted effort to expand our presence in the LDT market. This is a very important area for us also for the generic front and in the clinical research and diagnostics markets. In Academia, we're focusing heavily on the clinical research areas that are getting good funding. What is certainly more difficult are the secondary sample preparation markets where basically in vitro samples are further purified, but we're lucky that the majority of our franchises in the primary area, and we're seeing actually very good growth in many of these pockets, even above market growth and not taking share. So this -- despite already very high market shares that some cases are 2/3 up to 80% in certain segments, we have enough segments above 90%, we're actually even taking share in those. So this shows a standardization is kicking in, and this also allows us growth, but on top of that new applications on emerging -- new demands are emerging for, I'll just highlight here, the next-generation sequencing area where there are some very specific demands on the front end sample preparation area, as we call it, that we have some very unique and differentiated solutions for that, that will provide us some good growth opportunities. So it's not up there on the 9%, let's say the generic academic sample preparation there, but it's not in the low-single digits. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division I'll try to fit a couple of questions into one. First off, Peer, where do you expect the CLIA status of the complete RGQ workflow could be? Is this something that could be submitted as moderate complexity? And then my second question, at a high level, what do you think is the difference between your success internationally versus in the U.S. in HPV? And where has average ASP trended for your U.S. HPV test nowadays? Peer M. Schatz Very interesting question, Dan, on the CLIA status for the QIAsymphony RGQ. So we think that the system here as it is lined up today with the 2-room system, which is actually the preferred system, most customers in Europe for instance, don't want to have an integrated system. This is very different to the United States. They don't want to have an integrated system because they prefer 2-room strategy as a running different downstream detection systems in addition to just realtime PCR. So while we all agree that intellectually it's a very interesting thing to integrate everything, the preferred route is a 2-component strategy in Europe. And this is something that we also see in great parts of the United States for LDTs and the system like it is there on a 2-system is something that would still not be a moderate complexity system, but you could think of ways, and I won't go too far in this, where you could actually create further simplification of the platform. The second question on the HPV pricing, we're doing extremely well outside the U.S. and just in terms of the competitive advantages, it's just plain and simple clear that all of the studies that are coming out, also over the course of 2013, we have not really highlighted them to show that the competing product are inadequate. They're just not catching disease as they should, and they are putting women at risk. And this is slightly different in the United States because we have a co-testing environment. So x U.S., we're having a very, very strong uptake and adoption of our technology, and it remains the gold standard and continues to have the overwhelming market share in the market. In the United -- the pricing in the United States was always substantially higher than in Europe, where we already have 30 different competitors, but now has come closer together and in some cases, the U.S. is already below Europe indicating that we're seeing irrational pricing. In other words, I think today, if anybody would conduct a trial for an HPV screening assay and have to spend -- probably required anywhere between $30 million and $60 million to get an approval, it would be very difficult to get a return on investment on that. And this just shows there's an irrational behavior in the market right now. I don't want to point out the specific prices you see, but the second comparable product is Chlamydia and it's -- you're starting to see very aggressive bundles. John Gilardi Okay, Peer, with that, I would like to close the conference call, and thank all of you for your participation.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division I'm going to ask a couple quickly here. Just first, on the decline in instrument placements, both within applied and pharma, I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that? We see pretty strong results from a couple of your peers. Second on QuantiFERON, any color on just the assumptions for Japan and China for this year? And then the timing of a fourth [ph] skin test? And then lastly, GeneReader, you talked a lot about it, we've seen some interesting innovation in the market, obviously it's a big market opportunity. When can we actually start to see some data on the GeneReader? Peer M. Schatz Sure. I'll take the latter 2 questions. And Roland, if you could follow-up then with the first on the automation. So in terms of QuantiFERON Japan, we had a challenging year 2013, as we had said before, it was quite volatile in terms of our ability to further convert the market, but we have been able to create now the foundation from which we expect strong growth in 2014 to continue. The growth in -- so we expect a much better year in QuantiFERON in Japan, which is by the way, the second largest market in the world for this, for latent TB testing. In China, we expect a very good uptake. We've done numerous studies already validating our technology and the key decision-makers there clearly have been highlighting our technology as the one of choice to move forward on. And this is evidenced by strong support that we've been receiving also in advance now of the formal approval, which we expect any day now. So that definitely is a substantial market opportunity. At the same time, we see no slowing down across the other regions in the uptake and are addressing one segment after the other and adding new opportunities constantly. So we expect QuantiFERON to do very well in 2014. And as you pointed out before, there are a number of new products around the TB franchise, but also additional targets for the QuantiFERON technology that we will be talking about, for instance, the CMV test that is already launched in Europe is doing very well and addressing a very interesting niche and very synergistic with other products. The second -- the last question you had was the GeneReader portfolio. So in the course -- during the course of 2013, we had the product out there with select customers in early testing. We're now working on integrating all of these components that we have into a complete sample to insight workflow. And this is what we really want to demonstrate to the market, is not the performance of the individual components but the complete workflow. And this is something that we will -- we expect to be able to launch over the course of 2014. We are not being more specific on timing at this point. Roland Sackers Yes, answer to your first question on implementation and growth rates here. First of all, we -- just to remind you, we clearly had a very strong fourth quarter 2012, the instrument sales are actually up 7%, and that was clearly very focused on QIAsymphony. And if you recall, what we said also over the course of the year, we clearly have seen a shift in terms of customer QIAsymphony placements in terms of how customers are going to buy these instruments. We see more and more customers going for, what we call, reagent [ph] models, meaning, they don't pay the instrument upfront but rather pay it -- we are a long-term commitment in consumables and an increased consumable price. It's still a trend which continues and that clearly had an impact on the academic, especially on the Applied Testing market. So we see this is as a main driver for that tough comps on the one-hand side. More and more reagent [ph] vendors on the other-hand side. QIAsymphony is still -- is a very successful very good placement numbers also in the fourth quarter, also the reason why we set another ambition goal for 2014, just 250-plus placements. And I think it is something that we feel quite comfortable with as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citigroup. Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Roland, I guess, can you just elaborate on the '14 guidance and more specifically on where the operating margin expansion is going to come from, particularly gross margin, R&D, SG&A? And then for Peer, Japan, you said no impact from stimulus, it's a little contrary to what we've heard from others. Do you have any confidence in terms of market share in Japan? Can you make any comments there, a potential loss if that's happening at all? Roland Sackers Let me start off with the question. On the gross margin side, I do believe the gross margin on a normalized basis around 71, 71.5, I think, is a kind of an area where we feel quite comfortable. Given the overall changes we talked about in this call so far on HPV and the other growth drivers. So I think that is a fair assumption that gross margins stays in that kind of an area. We do expect, on the other hand, significant leverage coming out of SG&A, clearly the area where we did a lot of changes over the last 12 to 18 months. Just recall what we did on setting up shared-service center, closing down smaller-sized clearly also will fluctuate our different sales channels. I would say that it's an area where we do expect leverage to come from R&D. It's an area where we believe spending somewhere between 11% and 12% of revenue is the right level of investment into our innovation, an area we feel quite comfortable with on the one-hand side, fueling very nicely our innovation pipeline, on the other hand giving us a very nice output on the same time. So all in, that clearly means that our EBIT margin for 2014 has to go at least 100 basis points. And so we feel also given our midterm goal of around 250 basis points that we see already here quite a significant part of that in the -- over the course of 2014. Peer M. Schatz All right. Let me see, the question on Japan, we -- obviously we know about the stimulus funding being implemented now. We also see how it is moving through to the bureaucracy. It depends on what segment you look at, how quickly the available funding does move through the bureaucracy of the actual spending organization, and academia is certainly quite a bit slower. And there's also -- there you also have to see how the healthcare system is designed in Japan. This is -- either it is private or it is also these rather large organizations. We're still waiting for the trickle-down to actually hit the purchasing organizations. And this is pretty much consensus across the direct peers in these various customer classes and product groups that we are active in. So we're benchmarking clearly against our peer group over the past few years, and we have always been in the top category in terms of growth. We expect this also for 2013, even though that was a difficult year in Japan for the complete community. We actually -- as per the intelligence we have -- we actually did quite well in comparison. And so in the classes that we have, we believe we held or actually gained market share in key areas. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division One on financials and one on next-generation sequencing, if I may. And starting off with the financial question on the operating cash flow, how should we see the intended doubling of the operating cash flows? It's a linear process of the next 3 years and particularly referring to 2014. And I would assume that the basis of 2013 plus the USD 65 million in negative -- a negative impact from restructurings, all under this -- this would come on top at least for 2014. And also maybe how should we expect CapEx going forward here? And on next-generation sequencing, I would like to refer to Slide 16 of your presentation. And then I have a question on the sample preparation kits that you're about to launch. How should we see the adoption of them? Is it that customers will likely wait potentially for the GeneReader to come? And do you expect them to sell quite well separately already, and who would use them right now? Any more color there would certainly help me. Roland Sackers Yes, Daniel, in terms of cash flow, as you said on the one-hand side, we do have a midterm goal of doubling our operating cash flow and on the other hand, we clearly have seen here a larger impact in 2013 as well. We still have a smaller number of payouts in 2014. So it's a quote [ph] in our P&L in 2013, but they're still around, I guess, $10 million, $15 million, which we have to pay out this year so affecting cash flow, but is a small amount in general terms. I do believe that we will see similar to what you see on EBIT margin improvement. We see that impact also in cash flow improvements so that this year should be more than a linear approach. We are able to reap off in terms of benefits. And that is a good starting point for going behind. So we did a lot of things in terms of working capital improvement. As you recall, we changed our logistic setup. We're working now with a global provider, very helpful also in inventory turnover. At the same time, we believe that we had quite a significant changes in SG&A, also the way we address our customers, which are more efficient and therefore should give us also cash benefits. So I would say, as I said, better than linear. Peer M. Schatz Second question, Daniel, was regarding what we call the universal solutions. We actually have an interesting position in next-generation sequencing is that we are already present in basically every single laboratory that is doing next-generation sequencing around the world, through the fact that we solved the upfront sample preparation part. Now if you look at next-gen sequencing, people often talk about sample preparation, but they are using the term for a different step in the process. We typically call sample preparation what you see here also on the list is transforming a raw biological sample into an analyzable nucleic acid. This is the purification and also the whole genome amplification, or whole exomes amplification or transcriptome amplification solutions that we have. This is -- here for instance, the whole transcriptome single cell kit, would follow the purification of the nucleic acid. And that's a step that we typically call sample preparation. What other people call sample preparation is typically then the target enrichment, the library preparation steps and basically the whole process following purified amplified DNA into the sequencer. The -- those -- what we call sample preparation steps are ones that we obviously have an extremely strong position in and in particular in the clinical arena, where degraded samples are used, and it is very challenging to go from a clinical sample into an analyzable nucleic acid. So from that perspective, we are simply adding to that portfolio the target enrichment of the library preparation steps. Target enrichment are basically the assays that we're talking about. We have a very broad offering and also have a new generation of these panels coming out this year, with a number of improved specifications and building on the diagnostic assay development capabilities that we have here at the company. The same is also true with the bioinformatics. So there's no need to wait for the complete workflow. We have a workflow that will be adoptable in the segment of the market, but have an extremely strong offering for the whole market. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So on the C. difficile assay that you submitted, I guess, a couple of questions. First of all, how many QIAsymphonys are in position in the hospital laboratories to basically use the test? I'm just trying to get a view here -- 1,000 installed base of QIAsymphony, how many of them are positioned to benefit from your molecular [ph] diagnostics menu? Peer M. Schatz I'll have to check the exact number, but we have about 2/3 of the systems in Molecular Diagnostic laboratories, of which at least 1/2, if not more, would be target opportunities for the C. diff assay. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division And as you go for FDA approval of the whole QIAsymphony platform, do those customers need to do anything different to sort of get their QIAsymphony able to run the assay? Peer M. Schatz No, this is something that can be upgraded simply through the software that -- the software upgrades that we provided for the approved platform. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Great. And just a couple of housekeeping questions, Roland, if I missed I apologize. Share count guidance for '14 and net interest expense guidance? Roland Sackers Net interest expense more or less unchanged compared to what we had so far. Of course, adjusted for the interest rate on incoming cash flows, but unfortunately there's a rather big amount as we all know, and the share count is around 244 for the first quarter and 243 for the full year, given the actual share price on -- or based on the $24 basis. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of ISI Group. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division I guess, Peer, as you likely mentioned sort of given this year, the transition year for the [indiscernible] and HPV declines and as you reposition now the company for growth in the outskirts, you've got new products that's going to be key component of that strategy and as you look at the things you had sort of in the portfolio, I think one of your key competitor had a number of new product announcements earlier this year now, does it change anything at all from the way you're looking at that from your perspective and for [indiscernible] clinical NGS marketing. And I'll follow up on the HAI question earlier, again, while that's a strong double-digit growth market, it's also getting a little crowded. How do you think of the go-to-market strategy and pricing? Peer M. Schatz Sure, let me take the second question first. There are several players in C. diff and there are others coming in. We don't see C. diff as a differentiating feature. We think that based on the performance of our assets, we have the potential to have an industry-leading performance of the assays as well as content provision that our assay will be able to give the user, but it is really a menu play. And remember, we're going for a broad menu, this would mean that we're approaching 25 assays running on QIAsymphony RGQ in Europe, which we shouldn't forget is about 40% of the world's market and growing very, very fast for us and we see C. diff as an important addition. In the United States, fewer players are in the market than in Europe. It's a necessary menu item and one that has a high clinical need and broad utility. So there's several versions of the assays that go very near patient and others that go very high throughput, and we state [ph] a very, very interesting segment of the midrange hospital market, like Derik alluded to. Your first part of the question was the new product strategy. If you look at our company, we are not dependent on new product -- new products coming out. And I'd like to maybe just do a theoretical calculation. If you look at the guidance we're giving, it assumes that the underlying revenues of everything, with the exception of the HPV screening franchise, is growing at 8% to 9%. I don't know of too many other franchises that are doing that, and all of these growth drivers are very long term. So QIAsymphony is still at the beginning of its life cycle, its first 1/3, let's say. And QuantiFERON we just barely started, and Personalized Healthcare, same thing. They're all 100 million-plus franchises. Bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing, the same. So we're not -- we don't need any magic new product bullet to be able to show substantial growth. If we assume that we bought them out in terms of the HPV screening pricing declines in 2015, which I think is a fair assumption if you look at where the numbers are today, and you suddenly see that the 8% to 9% shine through, you can just imagine what happens to the overall growth profile of the company, and that's what we have always been working towards and what we've been preparing for long-term, long runway growth drivers that we can ultimately use to paint the overall growth profile or paint the overall profile of the company. In terms of next-generation sequencing portfolio, this is moving forward. It's an important part of our overall franchise, and we're quite excited about the opportunity to play in this area. But I'd like to stress again, we are not including any revenues from next-generation sequencing in our numbers, it is depending on the timing of the launch, it's depending on when we decide to move forward with the sample to insight offering. For now, we have excluded anything from the guidance in terms of revenues, and we clearly see an underlying strong growth engine of the 8% to 9% of the underlying business that will shine through by itself. And next-gen would be a very exciting addition to that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley, Research Division It's actually Michael Clerico on for Dan. Looking at increasing QIAsymphony placements, could you guys give us an update on the consumable pull-through, where it is currently and what the opportunity is? Also has the consumables factored into your 100-basis-point outlook for revenue contributions from QIAsymphony? Peer M. Schatz So we have 2 components in the QIAsymphony like revenue measurement, there's the core portfolio that are directly associated assays and sample technologies running in basically a samples [ph] to result mode, and then we have a large portfolio of assays that run on LDTs or using different downstream detection [Audio Gap] next-generation sequencing or so. The broader portfolio is driving a much higher growth rate than the 1%. The core portfolio is contributing 1% and growing into good double-digit pace. The outlook for or in terms of the pull-through, we're seeing increases, constant increases in pull-through, which is very different by region. The average is somewhere between 60,000 to 80,000 that we're running on the core assay portfolio. But in Europe, we're well into 6 digits with many customers running 200,000, 300,000 a year on the platform. And even at that rate, it is only -- it is not fully utilized. In the United States, with the LDT menu being the primary driver currently, we still are in the rate below the $80,000 range. And because we have very many placements in the United States, adding menu to the platform will allow us to quickly move the throughput also up there in that region. Michael Clerico - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Okay. Also in terms of doubling your operating cash flow, over what time frame do you think this could happen? How fast do you expect the initial inflection to occur given restructuring is largely behind you? Roland Sackers Yes, Michael, Roland. So what we believe is truly that we see already a larger impact clearly going to happen in 2014 for exactly that reason. And because -- also even -- when we invested significantly into growth drivers for the year 2014, it is clearly also something where we believe it increased returns in 2014 as well, so we'll see clearly a larger impact for the year 2014. Midterm, what we call, was 3 to 4 years, and again we will see more than linear impact over the course of 2014 going to happen. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Jose Haresco of JMP Securities. Jose T. Haresco - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division With regards to next-generation sequencing, there's obviously been a lot of product announcements over the last few weeks. Where is there still white space regards to specific applications, when you think about it below the population sequencing level? Is it exomes sequencing, is it in small labs, is it in certain types of academic labs? Or is it more on a regional basis? Peer M. Schatz Sure. First of all, it's a vast market opportunity. There's some very big numbers that have been put out there. Wouldn't even go that far in terms of the sizes, you just say that it's a large market opportunity that is synergistic to what we're doing today. So where we see the market opportunities is in simplification and dissemination. Most of these workflows are still tremendously complex. There's some very good solutions out there, but they still require very skilled operators and what we're trying to put forward is something that simplifies it and allows a higher sample throughput without the complexity of having to pool samples and batch them. So from that perspective, we are targeting the clinical research and the diagnostic markets. These are really core Qiagen turf, especially because of the complexity of the sample processing, the proximity to the diagnostics franchises, the requirement for high-quality reagents where you often manufactured under design control and high quality -- or developed under design control and manufactured under very stringent quality control systems. And this is something -- these areas that we think will have very differentiating capabilities. Sample throughput, also a need, for instance, in some of the more applied markets out there, but the big ones are for us at the clinical research and routine diagnostics markets. So this would be also typically everything exome and below in terms of capacity. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division A couple of questions. First off, Roland, it looks like the acquisition contribution, I believe, is about $12 million for the quarter. So one's just a simple accounting question, can you help us break out the split between the different operating groups there? And then secondly, and maybe for Peer, considering or looking at the diagnostic pipeline, obviously a number of different hospital acquired inspection [ph] test in there, can you talk a little bit about where MRSA is, or perhaps when that might flow in this pipeline as well? Roland Sackers Yes, on the fourth quarter, the acquisitions are split again over all 4 different business areas and customer segments. We clearly -- we see right now a little less than 1/2 in Academia, a larger amount in Pharma and then really split down between Applied Testing and Smaller Molecular, so I would say a little less than 1/2, probably 40%, 50% growth in Academia, then Pharma, then Applied Testing. Peer M. Schatz Great. Second part of the question was the hospital acquired menu. So we hope MRSA, first half, we are -- we also hope that MRSA is not a timeframe or a 2014 submission and the -- concurrently or a little bit before that CE marks. On top of that, I'd refer to the menu roadmap that we put out, for instance, in our Analyst Day, that has some details on when we expect those 2 to come forward. These are just a few of a broader menu that we actually have in development. We're working on about over 30 different projects right now. So there's a lot of development activity to expand the menu. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Capital. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Question on QIAsymphony, you mentioned the 250 placement goal for 2014. Just curious, how many of those are you expecting to be in the United States? And you mentioned 2/3 in molecular labs, can you break out how many of those 2/3 are in U.S.-based labs? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So we put a number -- it's about 50% to 60% are typically in the United States, of which about 2/3 in the States may be a tick higher, about 70% are in molecular labs. The -- so the presence is definitely heavily towards molecular and the U.S. has a very strong position in terms of placements. This is only on the LDTs. I think this is indicative of where we think it could go. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Great. And just as kind of a higher level follow-up question, you're mentioning the extraction part of the business earlier. I was just thinking or wondering how are you thinking about the growth of just that legacy [indiscernible] extraction business for 2014 as a piece of that 8% to 9%, or 8% or 9% growth in the core of the business? Peer M. Schatz Sure. It's actually quite differentiated. So there are -- just as an example of some of our instruments, we have about 180, 190 different protocols for different sample types and different applications. So in extremely differentiated -- it's not a very homogeneous requirement that our customers have. And that's one of our strengths, we have been able to solve all of their needs with very integrated solutions that are able to integrate a lot of protocols. We are seeing -- actually we have a targeted effort to expand our presence in the LDT market. This is a very important area for us also for the generic front and in the clinical research and diagnostics markets. In Academia, we're focusing heavily on the clinical research areas that are getting good funding. What is certainly more difficult are the secondary sample preparation markets where basically in vitro samples are further purified, but we're lucky that the majority of our franchises in the primary area, and we're seeing actually very good growth in many of these pockets, even above market growth and not taking share. So this -- despite already very high market shares that some cases are 2/3 up to 80% in certain segments, we have enough segments above 90%, we're actually even taking share in those. So this shows a standardization is kicking in, and this also allows us growth, but on top of that new applications on emerging -- new demands are emerging for, I'll just highlight here, the next-generation sequencing area where there are some very specific demands on the front end sample preparation area, as we call it, that we have some very unique and differentiated solutions for that, that will provide us some good growth opportunities. So it's not up there on the 9%, let's say the generic academic sample preparation there, but it's not in the low-single digits. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division I'll try to fit a couple of questions into one. First off, Peer, where do you expect the CLIA status of the complete RGQ workflow could be? Is this something that could be submitted as moderate complexity? And then my second question, at a high level, what do you think is the difference between your success internationally versus in the U.S. in HPV? And where has average ASP trended for your U.S. HPV test nowadays? Peer M. Schatz Very interesting question, Dan, on the CLIA status for the QIAsymphony RGQ. So we think that the system here as it is lined up today with the 2-room system, which is actually the preferred system, most customers in Europe for instance, don't want to have an integrated system. This is very different to the United States. They don't want to have an integrated system because they prefer 2-room strategy as a running different downstream detection systems in addition to just realtime PCR. So while we all agree that intellectually it's a very interesting thing to integrate everything, the preferred route is a 2-component strategy in Europe. And this is something that we also see in great parts of the United States for LDTs and the system like it is there on a 2-system is something that would still not be a moderate complexity system, but you could think of ways, and I won't go too far in this, where you could actually create further simplification of the platform. The second question on the HPV pricing, we're doing extremely well outside the U.S. and just in terms of the competitive advantages, it's just plain and simple clear that all of the studies that are coming out, also over the course of 2013, we have not really highlighted them to show that the competing product are inadequate. They're just not catching disease as they should, and they are putting women at risk. And this is slightly different in the United States because we have a co-testing environment. So x U.S., we're having a very, very strong uptake and adoption of our technology, and it remains the gold standard and continues to have the overwhelming market share in the market. In the United -- the pricing in the United States was always substantially higher than in Europe, where we already have 30 different competitors, but now has come closer together and in some cases, the U.S. is already below Europe indicating that we're seeing irrational pricing. In other words, I think today, if anybody would conduct a trial for an HPV screening assay and have to spend -- probably required anywhere between $30 million and $60 million to get an approval, it would be very difficult to get a return on investment on that. And this just shows there's an irrational behavior in the market right now. I don't want to point out the specific prices you see, but the second comparable product is Chlamydia and it's -- you're starting to see very aggressive bundles.
