In addition we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary. And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you, Amrita. And thank you for joining us today. This quarter we achieved record revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow, and over-performed our prior guidance. The size and engagement of our community remains strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities, as well as adjacent opportunities, like consumer products, advertising, and esports. One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world, through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities, anchored through organized competition. Throughout history, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. Until the 20th century though, sports like football, baseball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs. Then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sports in our everyday lives has grown exponentially, and so have the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize esports now exists, and we think the impact can be as significant as the traditional sports we know and love. The franchises we've built over the years deliver competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports, but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers, with the share of millennials two to three times higher than any of the big four U.S. sports. We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players, and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players will become the role model and inspired competitors of the 21st century. The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales, and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for esports, the over the top ESPN of video games. To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and a $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching esports and playing our games, over the long term our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 400 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform, Ad King. Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation we have and as we have done for 26 years. And now Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you. Thomas Tippl - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you, Bobby. We're off to a very strong start this year. We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, over-performed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising our guidance for the full year. Our results continue to be driven by focus and execution against our three strategic pillars. First, expanding our audiences, second deepening engagement, and third providing more opportunities for player investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year and relatively stable versus the prior quarter, despite no new full-game releases. Blizzard's fastest growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high water mark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's eighth $1 billion franchise. Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well, reaching 70 million registered players life-to-date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1. Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III. And we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty: World War II, releasing November 3. When Activision greenlit this game more than 2.5 years ago, the team knew it was time to return the franchise to its roots, and fans are already sharing their excitement for Call of Duty: World War II. Activision revealed the game at a global live stream from London last week, which became the most watched live stream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history, and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in one day. Additionally, though it's still very early, pre-orders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty: World War II will deliver the gritty authentic cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for. Activision along with its partners at Bungie also recently revealed the much anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was released, and early leading indicators including pre-orders for Destiny 2 are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we're offering an expansion pass for Destiny 2, containing two future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the SKUs that contain the expansion pass have attracted the majority of pre-orders so far. We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post-launch highlight the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more about both Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II in the months ahead. Turning to our next strategic pillar, our compelling games, deep gameplay and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch again had strong engagement this quarter thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the three seasonal events before it, drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising included a player versus environment game mode, which drew record hours of player engagement, demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player versus player competition. In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Storm 2.0, with a more powerful progression system, reward pack loot chests, and new battleground, and more compelling heroes, all of which brought players back into the game. Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature updates more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year, and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. To round out the terrific performance of Blizzard's games, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un'goro. King's MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter, but community engagement trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent by daily active user is now a record 35 minutes. King also had the highest DAU to MAU ratio since 2013, with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising. Esports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community, and there were many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney, and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft II World Championship Series, Hearthstone Championship Tour, and Heroes of the Storm Global Championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm college tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch APEX League completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of a busy year of Overwatch esports, as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL Championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year, and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a prize pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season long prize pool to-date of $4 million. Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again the virtuous cycle of engagement leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great new content. Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games. King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the 7th quarter in a row to a new record. King continues to have two of the top ten grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with PlayStudios in the social casino segment, slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base, as well as attract new players to the King network. As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game, and we're excited about the potential of bringing these two great teams together. In summary, we are off to a terrific start in 2017, with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We are also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II and the continued progress on new growth opportunities, like advertising, esports and consumer products. We are excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead. Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thanks, Thomas. Today I will review our better than expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow. To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis, when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. As anticipated, Activision Publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the two exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II. King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard business continue into 2017. Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business over-performance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record, $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year. From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week on May 10 we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016, to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017. Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard's busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including momentum from the March 28 World of Warcraft content update; a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un'goro; the Overwatch Uprising event; and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2. Activision expects to release Call of Duty's second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, they will launch new zombies content for Black Ops III, as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged while at the same time beginning the ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including the net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23%, and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million, and EPS of $0.15. For Q2 on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23%, and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. Just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and remove the net recognition of deferrals for $0.11. Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though it is still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product cost of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals, or $0.08. So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generation speak to the strong year-round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year, but we are seeing some promising early data points on our two major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio combined with promising emerging business opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline and long term shareholder value creation. Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And at this time, we'll take a question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Yes, so first congratulations on the quarter, and thank you for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could provide more detail on the Call of Duty: World War II release this November, and maybe specifically what you have planned to bring more players into the game. Thanks. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, thanks, Tim. Maybe the easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start. But we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the live stream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like to dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is the – that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we – was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated at about 0.2% at reveal. So, I think, we're going to have a great game. And I think we have the right game at the right time. Obviously there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously we have a lot of confidence in what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: World War II, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we – I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be excited to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years. Operator And this time we'll take a question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks, guys. My question for Bobby or Mike around Overwatch, and you must be encouraged by the pace of growth with the user base. I'm wondering just how large of a market opportunity you think there is for this game, how you plan on maintaining that pace of growth, and on a related note if you could provide an update on the progress of the Overwatch League, including timing of league sales and kick off of the league. Thanks. Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Colin. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. So right now we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we release new types of gameplay through our seasonal events. And we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia as well as our strong presence on both PC and Console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out of game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful in fueling passion for the game's lore. And we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months and I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Yeah, as far as the team selling process is concerned, Colin, if you look back at the history of when we started this, it was really building a structure that would allow us to celebrate, recognize, and reward our players, and that was our principal priority. What we've come to realize is there's a big commercial opportunity potentially as well. So we've got a great team assembled with people from places like ESPN, Fox Sports, the NFL, the NBA. We've been out meeting with prospective team owners, both endemic teams as well as professional sports team owners, and the reception has been terrific. We'll be announcing our key city sometime later this year and give a little bit more detail into what the play schedule will be. But not for another few months. Operator Let us now move to San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Hi. This question is for Riccardo. Can you tell us a bit more about King engagement, what you're focused on at this point? And how you think by driving that business, you're growing engagement. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi Phan. It is Riccardo. So engagement has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we are very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in last quarter was around 35 minutes per day. And this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So, great results. And it's also great result that create engagement, it translates into how you're monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per pay year have gone up for the seventh consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new fresh content in the live games, and we do – we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific timeframe. And this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do then, we also release features, which are permanent. So that they are impacting the gameplay for the long term. And both of those – the content releases are in the live games. What we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross promoting players from one game to the next game. And by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game but at network level. And then of course we release new games and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year. And the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch, and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier, Thomas, we have now – we're also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with PlayStudios, which will go live towards the ends of the year. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator At this time, we'll take a question from Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks. So given Blizzard's slate this year, with less full games being released, just curious how you think about the content to help keep the community engaged throughout the year and how you think about the monetization of that engagement? Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Evan, this is Mike. So, yeah, this year for Blizzard represents a new type of pipeline, one that's not necessarily based on full game launches, but instead on delivering new content updates for our games. This quarter, we have meaningful new content for every franchise in our portfolio. In fact, a few weeks ago we set a new DAU record on the back of these new content updates. This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before. Operator At this time we'll move to Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks, good afternoon. Looks like King has posted some developer job openings for Call of Duty mobile game. Can you provide us with any more detail on the game and your plans with that going forward? Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Sure, I'll start. Riccardo, then maybe you can jump in. So, yeah, Thomas mentioned King and Activision are teaming up to build a Call of Duty mobile game from the ground up. And the goal is to take a brand that tens of millions of people know and love and reinterpret it in a way that is appealing to the mass mobile audience. And we think it's a big opportunity. With King's experience making massively accessible and engaging games for that platform, and Activision's experience building one of the most enduring and appealing and engaging gaming franchises ever, we think we have the right combination of skills to pull it off. But obviously it's very early days. But that's the goal. Riccardo? Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Mike. So I believe if I may I will add a couple things to what Eric just said. First of all, and most importantly, and I'm talking here for the entire King's team. I'm super excited about this incredible opportunity, and to work together with the incredible team at Activision Publishing. One of the things which really excited us when we joined the Activision Blizzard family was the strength of the team on one side and the incredible quality and depth of their portfolio of games. And now we have the opportunity to work together on one of the jewels in this portfolio. So, this is super exciting. Of course, as Eric was saying, it's still early days. We are just at the beginning of this process and of the development, and it will take many iterations, as we know well, to create a game of incredible quality. But we are super focused on it. We put amazing people on this task. The target is to develop a game of broad appeal and to combine in doing it the experience of King of creating mobile games of broad appeal with the great experience in the genre and in the shooter genre of Activision Publishing and the experience of creating a franchise which has been around for a very long time. And so I believe that this is a really significant future opportunity, and I'm very excited to work together. Operator We'll now move to Doug Creutz with Cowen. Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC Yeah, I wonder if you could give as much update as you can on when you expect to rollout advertising to the King user base, and maybe talk about what some of the gating items are to do that? Thank you. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Doug. So advertising is still in beta. In Q1 of this year, we've been doing further testing. We've built the internal capabilities, and we've built the team and are continuing to build the team. Currently, we are testing in seven titles, including some of our largest titles, with Candy, Candy Soda, and Farm Heroes. And we're testing different ad formats to ensure that we have the best possible player experience and also to ensure that we have the best possible return for our advertisers. We're seeing that in the market there's incredible demand for high quality mobile video ad symmetry, and we continue to be very excited about this opportunity, because we think we are in a very strong position both because of the size of the network and as you've heard before, because of the engagement of our players. So as we said earlier this year in – at our last earnings call in February, we expect to become profitable with this business line, with advertising this year, and to scale up the business in 2018. Operator Our final question today will be from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. A question on Destiny. Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for Destiny in the new guidance given the dual platform, console and PC release? And then talk a little more about the digital and the MTX innovation you see coming with the title and what type of contribution you expect in that? Thanks. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thanks, Brian. Well, the community's reception to the reveal was obviously awesome. And after four weeks, Destiny 2 pre-orders are tracking amongst the top in Activision Publishing's history. So the most important thing for this franchise beyond delivering a great game, which Destiny 2 is definitely going to do, as we talked about in the past, is getting the content pipeline right. Destiny's engagement has been the best in Activision's history. And we now have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to keep up with demand with that steady stream of great content to sort of keep pace with our player's engagement post the release of Destiny 2. So as you know from our past comments on previous calls on – with Destiny 2's content, we're coupling Bungie's great visionary leadership with multiple AAA developers that have a proven track record here at Activision to help us make sure that we have just one great piece of new content after another to keep the community engaged. And that's the most important answer to the second part of your question. We've shown that when we have great engagement, great business follows. So with respect to PC, which you asked about, we're committed to delivering meaningful features that are bespoke for the PC community and I'm really excited about what we have to show for them. But I'm going to leave the details of those for our gameplay premiere event which is happening on May 18. And we'll have some additional, obviously, exciting announcements on the game overall at that time as well. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. All right. Thanks, Brian, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll look forward to seeing many of you at E3 or on our earnings call this summer. So thank you. Operator And again, that does conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

And at this time, we'll take a question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Yes, so first congratulations on the quarter, and thank you for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could provide more detail on the Call of Duty: World War II release this November, and maybe specifically what you have planned to bring more players into the game. Thanks. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, thanks, Tim. Maybe the easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start. But we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the live stream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like to dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is the – that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we – was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated at about 0.2% at reveal. So, I think, we're going to have a great game. And I think we have the right game at the right time. Obviously there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously we have a lot of confidence in what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: World War II, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we – I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be excited to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years. Operator And this time we'll take a question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks, guys. My question for Bobby or Mike around Overwatch, and you must be encouraged by the pace of growth with the user base. I'm wondering just how large of a market opportunity you think there is for this game, how you plan on maintaining that pace of growth, and on a related note if you could provide an update on the progress of the Overwatch League, including timing of league sales and kick off of the league. Thanks. Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Colin. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. So right now we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we release new types of gameplay through our seasonal events. And we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia as well as our strong presence on both PC and Console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out of game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful in fueling passion for the game's lore. And we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months and I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Yeah, as far as the team selling process is concerned, Colin, if you look back at the history of when we started this, it was really building a structure that would allow us to celebrate, recognize, and reward our players, and that was our principal priority. What we've come to realize is there's a big commercial opportunity potentially as well. So we've got a great team assembled with people from places like ESPN, Fox Sports, the NFL, the NBA. We've been out meeting with prospective team owners, both endemic teams as well as professional sports team owners, and the reception has been terrific. We'll be announcing our key city sometime later this year and give a little bit more detail into what the play schedule will be. But not for another few months. Operator Let us now move to San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Hi. This question is for Riccardo. Can you tell us a bit more about King engagement, what you're focused on at this point? And how you think by driving that business, you're growing engagement. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi Phan. It is Riccardo. So engagement has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we are very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in last quarter was around 35 minutes per day. And this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So, great results. And it's also great result that create engagement, it translates into how you're monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per pay year have gone up for the seventh consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new fresh content in the live games, and we do – we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific timeframe. And this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do then, we also release features, which are permanent. So that they are impacting the gameplay for the long term. And both of those – the content releases are in the live games. What we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross promoting players from one game to the next game. And by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game but at network level. And then of course we release new games and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year. And the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch, and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier, Thomas, we have now – we're also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with PlayStudios, which will go live towards the ends of the year. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator At this time, we'll take a question from Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks. So given Blizzard's slate this year, with less full games being released, just curious how you think about the content to help keep the community engaged throughout the year and how you think about the monetization of that engagement? Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Evan, this is Mike. So, yeah, this year for Blizzard represents a new type of pipeline, one that's not necessarily based on full game launches, but instead on delivering new content updates for our games. This quarter, we have meaningful new content for every franchise in our portfolio. In fact, a few weeks ago we set a new DAU record on the back of these new content updates. This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before. Operator At this time we'll move to Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks, good afternoon. Looks like King has posted some developer job openings for Call of Duty mobile game. Can you provide us with any more detail on the game and your plans with that going forward? Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Sure, I'll start. Riccardo, then maybe you can jump in. So, yeah, Thomas mentioned King and Activision are teaming up to build a Call of Duty mobile game from the ground up. And the goal is to take a brand that tens of millions of people know and love and reinterpret it in a way that is appealing to the mass mobile audience. And we think it's a big opportunity. With King's experience making massively accessible and engaging games for that platform, and Activision's experience building one of the most enduring and appealing and engaging gaming franchises ever, we think we have the right combination of skills to pull it off. But obviously it's very early days. But that's the goal. Riccardo? Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Mike. So I believe if I may I will add a couple things to what Eric just said. First of all, and most importantly, and I'm talking here for the entire King's team. I'm super excited about this incredible opportunity, and to work together with the incredible team at Activision Publishing. One of the things which really excited us when we joined the Activision Blizzard family was the strength of the team on one side and the incredible quality and depth of their portfolio of games. And now we have the opportunity to work together on one of the jewels in this portfolio. So, this is super exciting. Of course, as Eric was saying, it's still early days. We are just at the beginning of this process and of the development, and it will take many iterations, as we know well, to create a game of incredible quality. But we are super focused on it. We put amazing people on this task. The target is to develop a game of broad appeal and to combine in doing it the experience of King of creating mobile games of broad appeal with the great experience in the genre and in the shooter genre of Activision Publishing and the experience of creating a franchise which has been around for a very long time. And so I believe that this is a really significant future opportunity, and I'm very excited to work together. Operator We'll now move to Doug Creutz with Cowen.

Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Amazon.com Q1 2017 Financial Results Teleconference. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks, I'll be turning the call over to the Director of Investor Relations, Darin Manney. Please go ahead. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hello, and welcome to our Q1 2017 financial results conference call. Joining us today to answer your questions is Brian Olsavsky, our CFO. As you listen to today's conference call, we encourage you to have our press release in front of you, which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter. Please note, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2016. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, April 27, 2017, only and will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially. Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and subsequent filings. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures. Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we have seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors, including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. Our guidance also assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions, investments, restructurings, or legal settlements. It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services, and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to draw attention to a new accounting rule that we implemented in Q1. The new rule requires excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation to be presented as an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows. We retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to re-classify excess tax benefits from financing activities to operating activities. And as a result, you will see an increase in our free cash flow measures for prior periods. Additionally, beginning January 1, 2017, the excess tax benefit or deficiency for stock-based compensation is recognized as a component of tax expense rather than equity. This change resulted in a decrease to our tax expense for the quarter and a corresponding increase to our net income and earnings per share. Specific changes are presented in the footnotes to the consolidated statement of cash flows and related metrics provided in our press release. Further disclosure of the impact of the adoption of this accounting change can be found in our Form 10-Q. With that, we will move to Q&A. Operator, please remind our listeners how to initiate a question Question-and-Answer Session Operator At this time, we will now open up the call for questions. . Thank you. Our first question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was – a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these – on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have – we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have – you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had – customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our – we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say – have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're – it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth? Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're – we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see – you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program. Operator Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few – you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing? Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC And the sorting centers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that – the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Please proceed with your question. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Got it. I saw on the front page of the release you're really focused on India. Can you give us a progress update on how you're doing? Any thoughts on how far you're willing to take the investment levels there? And what are your thoughts on maybe when international margins can start to make progress? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Justin. Thank you. Yes, I think Jeff's comments were pretty dead on. The launch of Prime last year was a big turning point. We've increased Prime selection by 75% since launching that nine months ago in India, also increased the fulfillment capacity for sellers by 26% this year. On the content side, we've announced A-Team in the original TV series and we're customizing the content, so it's a really vast selection of local and global movies and TV shows that are available to the Indian public. You'll also notice that the Fire TV Stick was – a new version of it was launched in India with some important features there such as the ability to search in Hindi and in English, free data usage for three months and also data monitoring, which is important there. So again, we continue to be encouraged by both the response from customers and sellers. As far as level of investment is concerned, it is certainly one of our important investment areas. We see a lot of potential for the country and our business there. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Any thoughts on how much it is impacting your international profitability? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I can't quantify it, or break it out specifically, but I will say it's a large factor as well as a couple other things in the international segment. So, keep in mind that we launched Prime Video in the fourth quarter, and now we have that in over 200 countries and territories. We're spreading a lot of the Prime benefits that we see in North America to other countries. We just opened up Amazon Fresh in Tokyo last weekend, but also Prime Now. You saw other things like our business B2B business just opened up in the UK. We have Amazon Devices. So there's a lot of moving parts here. The other big influence is the same trends are happening in international with respect to FBA growth and the fact that our Amazon fulfill network, or the units we shipped, are growing at a much faster clip than our paid unit growth. Last year we said that was a 40% – nearly 40% growth worldwide. So we're making the investments in warehouses, fulfillment capacity and delivery capacity to handle that. So there's a lot going on in international. We are very encouraged with the growth of the Prime program, and we're hopeful for the Prime Video that we launched in the fall. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Two questions. The North American operating margins seem to come down like 70 bps year-over-year, and I know it's not big books view of the margins, I get that. But it's sort of a change. You've had margins be flat or up year-over-year for quite some time, and then they dipped down. Just could you explain that? And then secondly on these – on the Echo devices, the Echo family, Alexa devices that are coming out, could you comment at all about what kind of impact you're seeing in terms of increased wallet or per share within households? Are you seeing it have an impact in terms of Amazon customers more likely to spend more once they have these devices in particular categories like groceries or household products, pantry products that they're more likely to spend because they have these devices in their houses, in their kitchens, in their living rooms? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Mark. Let me start with the Echo question first. So, yeah, we're very encouraged by the customer response to the Echo products. Not only the Echo products but the ability to use tablets, our tablets now as Echo devices, since we've spread the Alexa technology to many of those devices. And we're also happy with the success we've had with developers. There's now over 12,000 Alexa skills. So we think that's all foundational. The monetization, as you might call it, is a theme of your questions. That's not our primary issue right now. It's about building great products and delighting customers. We think as engagement – as we pick up engagement with the devices, it helps the engagement with Amazon as a whole. So whether someone is ordering off their Alexa device or whether they're going to their phone, or going to their computer, it all has the same effect for us. So, very pleased with the initial progress. We see a lot of momentum there and we continue to invest. And that's one of the answers to your second question on North America operating margin. So if I step back, let me just talk generally about investments. So right now, we're just seeing a lot of great opportunities before us. And we're continuing to ramp up the investments in pursuit of those opportunities. And the big picture is, again, as we've said customers – the things customers love can grow to be large, we'll have strong financial returns and they're durable and can last for decades. So in that category, and some of the things that we're investing the most in are as you say the Echo and Alexa devices. We're doubling down on that investment, video content and marketing, not only in the U.S. but globally with the launch of our Prime Video in the fall. So, we're building global scale in that business in both content and marketing. As I said earlier, we're expanding Prime benefits in the U.S. and also globally. Things like Prime Music, Prime Now, Amazon Fresh, all expanding globally. And we have launched Prime in India, China and Mexico. I know I'm drifting a bit from North America, but it's all part of the same theme. We also have this trend going on in our fulfillment networks where strong FBA growth and high growth in Amazon fulfilled unit is resulting in a large increase in fulfillment capacity. We're also investing in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning. You're starting to see some of that show up in things like Amazon Go, our beta store that we have developed in Seattle, drones. We use those technologies a lot in our internal businesses and we're also developing services for AWS customers. So – and that's of course another area is AWS continues to grow and add services and features and doing so at an accelerating rate. So there's a long list, and I can keep going. But I think the general theme is there's a lot of investment in front of us that we're optimistic about, and we continue to ramp those investments. In North America, that manifests itself mostly in the device area, the content area and also the expansion of the fulfillment networks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Amazon always had a pretty big focus on efficiencies. I'd be curious if you could talk about examples or areas where you have been able to iron out inefficiencies in the fulfillment process. And any still existing examples where you see low hanging fruit to really improve fulfillment efficiency? And then back to the point on investment. You didn't mention brick and mortar at all. There's been a lot of mention in the press about Amazon brick and mortar. I guess it would be curious to hear how you think about the importance of an Amazon brick and mortar presence and how that fits into the long-term strategy? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure thing. So, particularly as it pertains to our fulfillment center networks, I think the biggest areas of efficiency right now are in our Amazon Robotics areas. That technology continues to improve, and we have – we're now multiple generations down. We just launched am Amazon Robotics fulfillment center in the Tokyo area recently, and I toured that last month, and it's just amazing to see the strides that Amazon Robotics has taken and the efficiency we're getting in our warehouse as a result. The other efficiencies that we're seeing are network efficiencies, especially as we add things like sort centers. It's a collaboration and the movement between warehouses and sort centers and then to the end customer. The ability to have control through our sort centers has allowed us over the last few years to extend our cutoff times from 3:00 p.m. in most cases till midnight. So, greater control of our processes. If we do it cost effectively can also have favorable benefits both for our warehouse flow and also for our customers and their ordering pattern. So, there's a lot of efficiencies that are going on day-to-day around here. One of the benefits of rapid growth is the ability to create leverage on purchases and a lot of the processes that we run. So, your second question was on stores. Yes, I think you're seeing the expansion of our bookstores. We have six bookstores right now, and we have announced another six. The Amazon Go is in beta in Seattle, and while that's not large and only one site, we're excited about the potential there and the use of the technologies of computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. We think that has a lot of potential. Again, it's only one location that's still in beta. But along with the bookstores, we also have – you'll see us in pop-up stores and college pickup points. So, for us it's another way to reach the customer and test what resonates with them, and we're pleased with the results. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question. Ronald V. Josey - JMP Securities LLC Great. Thanks for taking the question. Brian, I think you mentioned the accelerating growth within AWS on new products and last year you added about 1,000. Can you just talk about maybe the plans for AWS and product growth going forward here in 2017 and the focus on innovation? Thanks Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, we haven't updated that number, but suffice to say the innovation pace continues to accelerate. We are very proud of the launches in Q4. The Amazon Connect, which we think will provide customer service capability to customers, and Amazon Chime, which we also believe will resonate with customers. We've had a lot of adoption of our new services. We've had – customers migrated more than 23,000 data basis using the AWS Database Migration Service since that launched last year. And just generally we continue to expand geographically. We have announced additional availability zones and regions worldwide. So, again, signed a number of big customers. I guess I would point out in the quarter, Liberty Mutual, Snap and Live Nation all starting relationships with us or expanding their current relationship. We're now over a $14 billion run rate. We're happy with the business and the team, and again, for us innovation is going to be key as we move forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Salmon with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Daniel Salmon - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian, I had a couple questions about your growing advertising business. We see more and more of it appearing on the site. And I was interested to hear a little bit more about how you expect that business to roll out internationally. I think it's largely U.S. based today, but be curious to hear about that. And then second, I think it's fairly obvious why someone selling within the Amazon ecosystem would be interested in promoting on the platform, but maybe tell us a little bit about maybe over the long-term there are opportunities for sort of non-endemic advertisers within your platform. Thanks. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yeah, it's pretty early in the days with advertising, but we're very pleased with the team we have and the results. Our goal is to be helpful to consumers and enhance their shopping or their viewing experience with targeted recommendations, and we think a lot of the information we have and preferences of customers and recommendations help us do that for customers. We have a sponsored product, it's off to a great start, and it's a very effective way for advertisers to reach those especially interested customers. While you're on the topic of advertising, I thought I'd point out that in other revenue, advertising is in other revenue, as is co-branded credit card agreements and also some other advertising services. That decelerated from 99% in Q4 to 58% in Q1. But the fluctuation and the volatility was essentially in the co-branded credit card agreements and the other services, which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter based on contract terms. And that's what happened. Advertising remained strong and was consistent growth with Q4. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Ju with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. So you periodically disclosed usage growth for AWS. But it has been some time since we saw one. So we're wondering if you can update us in terms of where you are now. If not, I mean, should we think about the growth in your cash deployment as an indicator of the ongoing growth? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. Sorry, I don't have a usage number to share with you today. If it will help, I will tell you that, again, we're now over $14 billion run rate. You clearly see our – we break out very clearly our AWS segment revenue and operating income, and you'll also keep in mind that there's price decreases that are part of the business, and we're pretty public when we do those. And if you remember last call, I mentioned that we had seven price decreases that were timed for December 1. So, about a third of the impact of those was seen in Q4, and then again that's one element of the sequential operating margin. But in general, we're very happy with that team and the progress they're making. And we're deploying more capital as you can see to support the usage growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Douglas T. Anmuth - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask you about CapEx. It looks like CapEx including leases more than doubled year-over-year. So I know you listed kind of a long list of the many investment opportunities here, but can you just point out anything else in particular that drove the pretty substantial increase there? Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Yes, the CapEx, which is principally the fulfillment centers was – grew 51% year-over-year. As you'll remember, we added 26 warehouses last – fulfillment centers last year, 23 in the second half of the year. Some of that cost of start-up is before the start-up some comes in a quarter afterwards. So there was some carryover from that. But generally, the biggest trend here is that the differential between Amazon fulfilled network unit growth and paid unit growth. So that nearly 40% growth in Amazon fulfilled units last year, and the continuation of the strong growth higher than the paid unit growth that we see in 2017 is resulting in a lot of fulfillment center capacity. And the fulfillment centers I'll also say with the robotics technology tend to be more capital intensive than prior versions of warehouses, and then they generally have much better operating efficiencies and variable costs following their start-up. On the capital leases, that grew 45%. A good deal of that is tied to the AWS business. As I just mentioned, a lot of that is tied to usage growth. But a caution; CapEx can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and if you look back to last year, the trailing 12 months was only 7% growth from the quarters through Q1 of last year. So certainly it was a bigger step-up in 2016 now carrying into 2017. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. I know that we talked about over the last couple of quarters that part of the step-up in CapEx was to catch up from the under-investment in 2015. Just curious if you'd say – have you made a lot of progress in terms of catching up with some of the fulfillment needs that you saw necessary in the business at the beginning of last year? And then I know you just said that you're – it's still early days in terms of advertising, but there's a perception out there that over the last year or so that the company has sort of really begun to focus more on this business opportunity. Has something really changed at the business in the last year? And do you see advertising becoming a more meaningful part of the business over the near to midterm, I guess? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with advertising. So, yes, I think scale is helping. We've had great teams working on advertising for a while now. Our scale and number of customers, number of clicks, number of eyeballs, and new content – video content and other opportunities for advertising has really helped create some scale in that business. So we're very happy. I can't project it forward. But we're happy with the growth there. I think the sponsor products was a very inventive move for us, and I think that is having some really good impact on advertising growth. On your second point about fulfillment capacity; here's how I'd generally generalize it. In Q4 of 2015, we were pretty vocal or pretty transparent anyway that we ran out of space in Q4, especially due to some very strong demand for FBA space and services. Last year we changed some of our incentives and worked with FBA merchants to try and have better throughput through our FCs, particularly in Q4. That combined with the step-up in fulfillment centers that I mentioned, the 26 new ones, left us in a really good position. We had a very clean holiday, and we think it worked well for both customers, Amazon and also for sellers – for FBA sellers. So that leaves us now continuing to grow internationally as well because we continue to see strong FBA adoption, and it's a big part of our business, and it's a big part of our value with the additional Prime eligible ASNs that FBA provides. So, again, they're self-reinforcing, the FBA program and also our Prime program. The Prime program attracts more people to Amazon, and they buy more including FBA products and conversely more FBA products in our warehouses helps our in-stock of things that people want to buy, Prime eligible in-stock, and that helps reinforce the Prime program. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of how we should think about the increase in unearned revenue. Obviously, this quarter biggest increase that you have seen from at least from a dollar perspective. What does that say about the way customers are changing in the behavior in the AWS business? How should we think about the way that that might be impacting pricing, mix, near-term growth? Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Heath. This is Darin. Yeah, on a deferred revenue balances, as we've said in the past, the primary drivers of that increase are both the activity that we're seeing with our AWS customers and the purchase of Reserved Instances and prepaid credits for their account, as well as Prime member purchases. We're not breaking out the specific growth rates for Prime, but certainly it – we like what we see in terms of the growth, and it's been consistent with what we have seen over the last quarter or so. Certainly, the – part of that increase in deferred balances is related to Reserved Instances. As customers get more comfortable and begin to put more sustained workloads into the AWS services through buying RIs, they're able to get fairly significant discounts on their usage. And so we like that model. Customers certainly like that model. And collecting that through deferred revenue and then letting customers use that over time is very helpful. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you. A question on the transportation and logistics initiatives. And in particular, if you could share any of the effects or learnings thus far with air cargo. In particular, what kind of performance or cost-efficiencies that you may be realizing or expect to realize from this effort. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure, Colin. As you point out, we're – we have expanded our own fleet. We now have 18 planes in service for Amazon, and we have announced rights to lease up to 40 planes. So it's gone very well. The ability to control shipments within our network has gone up, and we think the cost is very good. So on that front, it's better control, better capacity control, especially search capacity, and also good costs. So we have great relationships with third party carriers. We will continue to and we value all our partner relationships as we develop our own capability particularly in intra-network. We're putting it to good use, as I mentioned before, with the sortation center example. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. Scott Devitt - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi. Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in terms of an investment in capabilities in India at this point and how you think about that market longer term. And then secondly, also if you could just comment on the limitations and your willingness to invest more throughout LatAm the way you have more recently in markets like China and India. And if I could, just finally, you've previously discussed satisfaction with the measurements of success for the video product in terms of consumer engagement, and the effects on Prime. I was just wondering if you could comment on whether these metrics are continuing to improve as spending continues to rise on video and consumer awareness is seemingly growing as well. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Let me start with your middle question. I think it was about Latin America growth. Let me step back and talk about international growth in general. So our approach varies by country, and if you look, historically we've taken multiple approaches. So in China, we bought an existing business Joyo.com and built off that base. In India, we started from scratch and have built a lot of things ourselves. And it's always going to depend on the country that the dynamics in that country both for retail, for online, and for foreign investment. But a real key factor in all of this generally is management bandwidth as well. So, we pick our spots carefully. You'll see – you heard in the quarter that we've announced the intention to buy Souq in the Middle East. Where does that fit into this strategy? Well, Souq's pioneered e-commerce in the Middle East, and they're creating great shipping experience for their customers and they're multiple countries, and they're doing a great job. So we see this as an example where we can learn from them, and also support their efforts with our Amazon technology and global resources. So we're in Mexico, but we're not in other parts of Latin America. We have a business in Brazil. But other countries we'll take on a case-by-case basis, again, bounded by what our management bandwidth can support and prioritization versus other things. You obviously heard my long list of investments. All of those are pretty much gated by the need for people and software engineers and strong teams to approach them. So international expansion gets played off in the same prioritization that other efforts do. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your questions. Jason Helfstein - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks. So is there just an accounting housekeeping a way to think about stock-based comp? You guys aren't providing that by segment anymore, but the rates of growth kind of differed by the businesses. And so is there just a way to think about, A, will that be in the queue? Or are you not disclosing it anymore? And is there a way to think about what I guess the patterns would be consistent with historical patterns by segment? Thanks. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc. Hi, Jason. This is Darin. Yes, we, a number of quarters back, started breaking out stock-based compensation by segment, and now we have collapsed that in our op income by segment. So it's definitely in there. We do provide some disclosure by P&L line item on a consolidated basis, that helps you identify that stock-based compensation expense in total and you'll see the trend and analysis and the metrics at the back of the press release. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I can take two away from the press release just to understand a little bit of the quarter-over-quarter cadence. On the retail subscription services, that saw a pretty big jump up in the growth rate year-on-year in Q1 versus Q4. I think that might be Prime memberships that come on to paid from trial. But just wanted to understand what maybe some of the driver was of that quarter-over-quarter in terms of the growth rate. And net shipping costs actually grew at the slowest rate by our count in a couple of years. It looks like you're starting to get some improvements there in terms of revenue over costs on the shipping line. Just wanted to know what that was in terms of what is driving that and can we expect that to possibly continue. Thank you. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. Let me start with the retail subscription services revenue. So there's multiple things in that category. The largest is Prime membership fees, but also other subscription services like audio books, eBooks, digital video, digital music, and other subscription services. So you're right, there was an acceleration, much like the comment I had on advertising and the other revenue category. The Prime membership growth rates for Q1 and Q4 last year are relatively consistent. So the volatility is in these other items. So I'm not quantifying the Prime membership or commenting on the growth rates, other than to say it's been very strong and Q4 strength has continued into Q1. Your comment on shipping costs, yeah, that is going to – it was lower unit volume as well, but generally, costs are going to be a combination of the tail – the headwinds are obviously going to be FBA growth and shipping more products ourselves and this expansion of our Prime program and the demand for products from our Prime customers. And the demand has been great. Again, there's over 50 million items that people can get delivered to their doorstep within two days or, in some cases, next day or same day. So it's going to be a big part of our cost structure but it's an investment we work hard to reduce as far as rates, and we're glad to spend it to support our Prime program. Operator Thank you. And our final question will come from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC Hi. Thanks. I had a follow-up and then a new question. The follow-up is, would love an update. You talked a lot about the fulfillment centers, but could you update us on where we are in terms of rolling out Prime Now facilities and sorting centers? You're just accounting a few – you feel that scenario, it's a really ramped up investment this year or what you got last year is sort of what you need? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sure. I'm sorry. You said Prime Now and what was the other thing? Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC And the sorting centers. Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Sort centers. Sort centers, right. Well, I don't have updated numbers for you, but the Prime Now is available in more than 45 cities across eight countries. The Same-Day is available in 30 cities in the U.S. So, that's a bit on the quantification of those. I can't tell you much more on sort centers. Greg Melich - Evercore Group LLC But were you thinking about building out the capacity? It sounds like last year, you had that big surge in fulfillment centers. There isn't a similar surge about to happen this year on some of those other areas? Brian T. Olsavsky - Amazon.com, Inc. Yes. I can't project that. We're still growing that and we're happy with the progress in Prime Now and the service that – the value that it creates for Prime customers. And as I said, we have expanded internationally, which was a big goal of ours as well. So we will continue to grow that. I can't quantify it for you right now. The other similar like facility metric you might want is that AmazonFresh is now in 21 metro areas in the U.S. as well as London and Tokyo. Darin Manney - Amazon.com, Inc.

Our earnings press release dated April 5, 2017 can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web-site at www.bedbathandbeyond.com. Here are some highlights. For the fourth quarter, net earnings per diluted share were $1.84. Net sales were approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4% compared to the prior year period. Comparable sales increased approximately 0.4%, and comparable sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. For the full year, net earnings per diluted share were $4.58. Net sales were approximately $12.2 billion, an increase of approximately 0.9%. Comparable sales decreased approximately 0.6%, and comparable sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, from $0.125 per share, to be paid on July 18, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. During our call today, Sue will review our fourth quarter financial results and discuss some of our planning assumptions for fiscal 2017, and then Steven will give an update on some of the initiatives we are working on to position ourselves for long-term success. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the call to questions. I will now turn the call over to Sue. Susan E. Lattmann Thanks Janet. I'll start with a review of our fourth quarter results. Our net sales were approximately $3.5 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4% over last year, which is consistent with our model assumptions in December. This increase is primarily due to a 3% increase in non-comp sales including PMall, One Kings Lane and new stores and a 0.4% increase in comp sales. The increase in our comp sales reflects an increase in the average transaction amount, which was partially offset by a decrease in the number of transactions in stores. We believe in an integrated and seamless customer experience, and as we have explained previously, while we cannot tell you through which channel a sale was initiated, we can provide information based on where the sale was consummated. With that said, comp sales from our customer-facing digital channels grew in excess of 20% while comp sales from our stores declined in a low single-digit percentage range. Gross margin was approximately 38% as compared to approximately 38.6% in the prior year period. This decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, first, an increase in net direct to customer shipping expense as a result of more promotional shipping offer activity including a change in the Bed Bath & Beyond free shipping thresholds from $49 last year to $29 this year and free shipping for the first few days of the quarter which included Cyber Monday, and second, an increase in coupon expense resulting from increases in redemptions and the average coupon amount. The inclusion of One Kings Lane reduced total Company gross margin as a percentage of net sales by approximately 12 basis points while the inclusion of PMall contributed 19 basis points to the total Company gross margin. For the full year, the rate of gross margin deleverage was the same as 2015, which was consistent with our model. SG&A in the quarter was approximately 25.8% of net sales. This compares to 24% in the fourth quarter of last year which included a favorable net benefit of approximately 50 basis points from certain nonrecurring items. The remainder of the increase as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to, in order of magnitude, an increase in advertising expenses and an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses. The inclusion of One Kings Lane and PMall increased total Company SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales by approximately 15 and 5 basis points respectively in the fourth quarter. Net interest expense was approximately $16.8 million compared to $24.5 million in the prior year period. This decrease in net interest expense was primarily the result of an $8 million favorable change in the value of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan investments, which was fully offset in SG&A and therefore did not impact net earnings. Our income tax rate was approximately 35% compared to approximately 36% in the prior year period. The fourth quarter provisions included favorable net after-tax benefit of approximately $9 million this year as compared to about $7 million last year due to distinct tax events occurring during these quarters. Considering all of this activity, net earnings per diluted share were $1.84. Moving onto the balance sheet, we ended the year with approximately $578 million in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities. Retail inventories were approximately $2.9 billion at cost, an increase of approximately 2.2% compared to the end of the prior year period. This increase was due in part to the growth in inventory in our distribution facilities for shipments to customers as well as the inventory balances from PMall and One Kings Lane. Retail inventories continue to be tailored to meet the anticipated demands of our customers and are in good condition. Capital expenditures for the year were approximately $374 million, with some of the anticipated spend for 2016 moving into 2017. CapEx for the year included the following; enhancements to our digital capabilities; ongoing investments in our data warehouse and data analytics; expenditures for the continued development and deployment of new systems and equipment in our stores, including the implementation of our new POS system into some of our stores; investments in new systems and support to accelerate the expansion of our online assortment; the replatforming of One Kings Lane's systems and integration of its support services; spending related to the opening of our new distribution facility in Lewisville, Texas; the expansion of our customer contact center in Layton and enhancements to its systems; and investments in new stores, including the opening of BEYOND at Liberty View in Brooklyn, store relocations and store refurbishments. During the fourth quarter, we opened nine new stores and closed four stores. For the full year, we opened 29 and closed 13 stores. Our store openings during the year included new store formats such as BEYOND at Liberty View and the two new andThat! stores, plus additional Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in Canada and new markets primarily for Cost Plus World Market and Harmon Face Values. Share repurchases under our current $2.5 billion share repurchase program were approximately $171 million in the fourth quarter, representing about 4.1 million shares. This authorization had a remaining balance of approximately $1.7 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. In addition, our Board of Directors today declared an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share, from $0.125 per share, to be paid on July 18, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 16, 2017. Regarding our outlook for fiscal 2017, which is a 53-week year, we are working off a set of assumptions as we do every year. Some of these assumptions are easier to model based upon our historical performance and current trends and some of these assumptions are more difficult to model due to variables such as timing and the sensitivity to the changing retail landscape. Then we have a number of things that are not included in our model but could impact our financial results this year, such as potential regulatory changes including corporate tax reform. So with that in mind, let's start with the assumptions that are easier to model given our historical performance and current trends. Taking into account the 53rd week in fiscal 2017, we are modeling a low to mid single-digit percentage increase in consolidated net sales for the full year. We are also modeling an increase in comparable sales. However, the range is from relatively flat to slightly positive, including continued strong growth in our customer-facing digital channels. We are modeling gross margin deleverage for 2017 including increases in net direct to customer shipping expense and coupon expense. We anticipate the 2017 rate of deleverage to be less than that of 2016. We are modeling SG&A deleverage as a result of payroll and payroll related expenses and technology expenses, including related depreciation as well as the impact from the current expense structures of One Kings Lane and PMall, both of which were acquired during fiscal 2016. We are modeling 2017 depreciation expense to be in the range of approximately $310 million to $320 million. We are modeling net interest expense of approximately $80 million for the full year. Capital expenditures are modelled to be relatively similar to fiscal 2016 subject to the timing and composition of projects. In December 2016, we said that we were modelling CapEx spend to be between $400 million and $425 million for fiscal 2016, and primarily due to the timing of our projects, we came in less than that at approximately $374 million. We believe for the foreseeable future that we are [indiscernible] at about these levels. In addition, more than half of the 2017 spend is planned for technology-related projects in support of our growing omnichannel capabilities. In fiscal 2017, we plan to open 30 new stores and close approximately 15 to 20 stores. We plan to open stores across all our concepts, including new formats and new markets. We expect our positive cash flow to fund our operations and capital expenditures as well as our quarterly dividends and share repurchase program. The completion of our current $2.5 billion authorization is planned for some time in fiscal 2020, subject to several factors including business and market conditions. Next let's move to the assumptions that are more difficult to model, such as various components of our tax rate. First, we anticipate that our tax rate will be higher as a result of the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard. The effect of this adoption on our tax rate is expected to vary by quarter and does not affect our cash outflows for income taxes. Second, even excluding the impact of this new accounting standard, we anticipate the net after-tax benefit from other distinct tax events will be lower than in 2016. Considering these assumptions, we are modeling our 2017 tax rate to be higher than last year but still within the mid to high 30 percentage range for the full year, with the first quarter being the highest for the year, slightly in excess of 40%, primarily due to the impact of the new accounting standard and the timing of the [indiscernible] investing schedules of our stock-based compensation. Finally, there are a number of events that we have not attempted to model but could impact our financial results this year, such as potential regulatory changes including corporate tax reform, interest expense deductibility, a potential border adjustment tax and healthcare reform. At this time, we don't have enough information regarding the timing and the scope of these potential events for us to make any reasonable assumptions. Based on the items that we have modelled, including a slight benefit from the 53rd week, the anticipated deleverage due to our continued investments and the higher anticipated tax rate, we are modeling a decline in net earnings per diluted share in the percentage range of low single digits to 10% for fiscal 2017. We believe our 2017 quarterly net earnings per diluted share will have a similar pro-rata percent to the total year as they have in the previous year, with the exception that the percent for the first quarter is anticipated to be somewhat lighter due in part to the adoption of the new share-based payment accounting standard and for the fourth quarter is anticipated to be somewhat stronger due in part to the slight benefit from the 53rd week. We look forward to giving you updates as the year progresses and as our visibility to the year improves. Before turning the call over to Steven, please note that our next quarterly conference call will take place on Thursday, June 22. At that time, we will review our first quarter results and provide an update on fiscal 2017. Steven? Steven H. Temares Thank you, Sue. During fiscal 2016, we made significant investments to evolve our Company and advance our mission to be trusted by our customers as the expert for the home and heart-related life events by continuing to build and deliver a strong foundation of differentiated products and services and solutions for our customers while driving operational excellence. As Janet said, we reported fiscal 2016 net earnings per diluted share of $4.58, which was consistent with our model. This marks the fifth year in a row that we've been in the earnings range of between $4.5 to just over $5 since we entered a heavy investment phase several years ago. It is important to note that while we are experiencing operating profit declines during this investment phase, we continued to produce some of the best returns in retail which allows us to make the investments necessary to build a strong foundation for future growth. We are excited about the advances we are making. Today I'll provide an update on some of the key developments over the past several months that are strengthening our competitive position as the expert for the home and heart-related life events. And by heart-related life events we mean certain life events that evoke strong emotional connections. These include the customer experience that we address through developing the best and largest wedding registry, our baby registry, our new mover programs, our college and camp businesses, as well as our developing design consultation services. Over time, these interactions allow us to cultivate deeper relationships and increase the lifetime value of our customers. I'll start with some recent examples of how we are doing this. As our footprint in the furniture and home decor category continues to expand and as we further our marketing efforts to create a more inspirational presentation of our offerings, we want to be able to provide more meaningful services and solutions to our customers who are making decorating decisions. In early March 2017, we acquired Decorist in a non-material cash transaction. Decorist is an online interior design platform that connects users to affordable, acceptable and personalized home design services. Through the Decorist platform, consumers and businesses can directly connect with bedded top-tier designers including nationally-renowned celebrity designers to collaboratively work through the design process. To increase customer confidence in purchasing furniture pieces, Decorist has developed and offers photorealistic 3-D renderings of how these items look in their actual homes. Decorist also offers additional online services, including a Design Bar advice tool which provides free expert design advice within 24 hours, inspirational boards, an editorial blog, designer tips and latest trends to further enhance customer engagements and develop deeper customer ties. While One Kings Lane and Cost Plus World Market had already partnered with Decorist to market and sell their furniture and home decor merchandise, we plan to add the growing home furnishing assortment from Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY to the mix. Through these relationships, Decorist also serves as another vehicle to showcase our expanding footprint in the furniture and home decor category. So, we look forward to supporting Decorist in its efforts to continue building brand awareness of their online business, increasing their revenue opportunities and developing their technology to further their leadership in the online interior design space. At the same time, as the interior design arm for Bed Bath & Beyond, we plan to leverage Decorist online platform to initiate and/or enhance our design consultation offerings for some of our concepts. In another example, as we focus on providing deeper and more personalized shopping experiences, we seek to strengthen our relationships with customers who are also cooking and baking enthusiasts. In January, we made a small acquisition of certain assets of Chef Central, including the brand and e-commerce Web-site. We also added knowledgeable and talented associates to our Company with great culinary retailing expertise. As a specialty retailer, Chef Central has been a trusted brand among cooking and baking enthusiasts for more than 15 years. We plan to leverage Chef Central's strength in merchandising and marketing to increase our ability to serve these customers. This includes leveraging their know-how and providing a more experiential omni-channel shopping environment in-store, including activities such as cooking classes and demonstrations. We anticipate continuing to support the Chef Central e-commerce Web-site and opening Chef Central inspired specialty departments within Bed Bath & Beyond stores and potentially freestanding stores. Our first Chef Central inspired specialty department is scheduled to open this fall in Paramus, New Jersey. These recent activities supplement the other investments we are making to develop a more deep-seated relationship with our customers, including those in One Kings Lane which serves as a cornerstone for our growing offerings in furniture, home decor and design, and in Personalization Mall which expands our personalization services and brings the complementary portfolio of differentiated products that help celebrate life events and special occasions. Collectively, these investments are furthering our ability to do more for and with our customers and advancing our position as the expert for the home and heart-related life events. These recent transactions also advance our ongoing efforts to delight our customers through our merchandising. Those of you who have followed us for years know that we are zealous about presenting an exciting and engaging assortment of products to our customers. Our ability to do this over the years has always been a differentiator for us, and today, product differentiation is more important than ever in keeping the interest of existing customers and attracting new ones. We pursue product differentiation in several ways, including our own product development and exclusivity and limited distribution with our vendor partners. For example, our product development team partnering with industry experts has recently introduced a new line of bed linens and bedding basics at Bed Bath & Beyond under our proprietary Wamsutta brand called Wamsutta PimaCott. PimaCott is made from 100% Pima cotton and is not only softer, more durable and more vibrant than regular cotton, but is also the first of its kind that can be tracked and traced throughout the supply chain using [VNA] [ph] technology. As a trusted expert for the home, it is important to us that our customers are confident that the products they purchase from us are truly 100% Pima cotton, and they can be by looking for the Wamsutta PimaCott label. We also plan to launch a line of Wamsutta PimaCott bath towels later this spring. Another example of our product development capabilities includes the launch of the One Kings Lane collection. This line of proprietary furniture and lighting debuted several months ago and has been well-received by customers. The One Kings Lane collection continues to grow and now includes a new line of outdoor furniture. Again, we believe the home furnishing space provides us a tremendous opportunity to build a large curated assortment of differentiated products to engage with our customers in a meaningful way and to provide inspiration across various lifestyles. Additionally, exclusive offerings further our efforts to differentiate our mix. For example, we have recently introduced the second edition of our ED Ellen DeGeneres Home Collection, which is available in most Bed Bath & Beyond stores and online. In addition to bedding and accessories, the assortment now includes kitchen linens, dinnerware and home decor including rugs. We are also excited to be one of the limited number of retailers authorized to sell an assortment of home furnishings for Magnolia Home designed by Joanna Gaines, the co-star of the home improvement show Fixer Upper. In partnership with our vendor, the Magnolia Home assortment includes a collection of rugs, pillows and throws that reflect Joanna's simple, fresh and timeless style. This collection is available online and in select Bed Bath & Beyond stores, including some of our Texas stores which showcase the whole collection in a Magnolia Home inspired department. We also continue to broaden our merchandise offerings for Linen Holdings, our institutional business, which consist of Harbor Linen and T-Y Group. Recently, Linen Holdings entered the hotel operational supplies and equipment segment, which basically covers many of the other items you can find in a hotel room besides the linens and towels. By leveraging our vast product network, Linen Holdings can now provide our hospitality customers with a one-stop shop to everything needed to fit-out a hotel room. Just as our merchandising has always been central to our success, at the very center has been our focus on serving our customers. While retailing continues to change introducing so many new ways to engage and interact, we continue to focus on providing a great customer experience across all our channels. For example, recent enhancements to our digital channels include improvements in search and navigation to enhance the relevancy of customer search results. We have enhanced the functionality of an existing search feature to make it easier for customers to search the Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY Web-sites to determine availability of products in their local stores. For our registry customers, we have recently launched an interactive checklist on these Web-sites which serves as a helpful guide throughout the online experience in providing a well-rounded giftable registry. This new tool complements the high-quality one-on-one registry service our in-store searches provide to our customers every day. An additional improvement to the customer experience is a new feature called Shop the Room, found under the Trends & Ideas tab on the Bed Bath & Beyond Web-site. This online guide contains a series of curated rooms for the living room, bedroom and bathroom that showcase an array of different design styles. The initial collections include at least five different lifestyle trends for the home. These collections are intended to engage and inspire customers as they think about their home decor options. Over the coming weeks, we are partnered to begin piloting a new service online that will connect our customers to quality professionals for home installation and other home improvement projects. As our assortment of home furnishings continues to grow, we remain committed to providing the services and solutions to excel in this category. Even with the right merchandise and the best services and solutions, we strive to communicate with our customers in increasingly meaningful ways. We have always used our marketing programs as a tool to forge these bonds but today our customer-centric marketing strategy is also supported by our enhanced analytics capabilities as we develop deeper relationships with our customers to personalize target marketing, including e-mail and direct mail campaigns. We are leveraging our improved predictive modeling tools to optimize our direct mail and print campaigns, including our newest seasonal home catalog titled Spring Refresh which was mailed a few weeks ago to a select group of customers and prospective customers. This new home catalog showcases our expertise of the home through a curated inspirational presentation of our expanded offerings, including within our home furnishings and decor categories. The virtual version of this catalog is also available online at bedbathandbeyond.com. As we evolve and grow our business, the opportunity to deliver best-in-class customer service across all our channels is greater than ever and we intend to do so. In furtherance of this objective, we are opening an additional customer contact center in Florida later this year that will supplement our other 24/7 operations in Utah, New Jersey and Massachusetts. As we work to differentiate our products and provide differentiated services and solutions to our customers, we also pursue operational excellence in everything we do. This includes continued enhancements to our supply chain network. For example, we plan to open a new 525,000 square foot distribution facility in Las Vegas during fiscal 2017. This new facility will replace a smaller fulfillment center in that area which will close in late 2017 and provide additional capacity to support the growth of our digital channels. We are also expanding our vendor direct to customer or VDC offerings into the Canadian market. In addition, we are piloting third-party app-based delivery services from some of our Cost Plus World Market stores. And later this month, we plan to begin a pilot for same-day delivery from certain Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY stores in several markets including Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C. As we look back over this past year, we have made and continue to make significant investments in our Company to advance our core objective, to be trusted by our customers as the expert for the home and heart-related life events by continuing to build on the strong foundation of differentiated products and service and solutions for customers while driving operational excellence. By focusing on our mission and remaining grounded in a culture obsessed with satisfying our customers along with maintaining strong financial discipline, we will become the customers' first choice for the home and heart-related life events and continue to achieve long-term success. I would like to thank our nearly 65,000 associates, including our new team members from Decorist and Chef Central, for their ongoing dedication and commitment to achieving our strategic objectives and improving our competitive position. I'll now turn the call back to Janet. Janet M. Barth Thank you, Steven. We will now turn to the Q&A portion of our call. As usual, we would appreciate if you would please limit yourself to one question, with one follow-up. Adrienne, we are now ready to take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes I realize it's early, but just maybe given the opportunity, how have the level [indiscernible] Shop the Home collections performed relative to expectations, and then how do you think about building brand awareness as the destination for furniture in general, and are you targeting your best customers first for this, any color about how you are approaching the marketing aspect and brand building aspect of that opportunity? Steven H. Temares I think it's early first of all to really seeing and the traffic isn't of the type that like you said I think it's nowhere and it's into build, and we really haven't done a real lot of marketing around it yet. And it's the same thing with the furniture and home decor offering. I mean first, we are working hard to get the offering in place and to get the offering right. There's a lot of growth that has to take place there. So we really haven't done significant marketing around it. You might have seen the books that we did and they went out to a limited audience. There was the book that went out in fall and the one that went out now in the spring, and it's a small segment of our population, and it's really a cross-section right now as we are trying to get the learnings from a cross-section of our customers. We have our customers segmented and this is a tool to enable us to learn about each of their patterns hopefully over time. So initially that's the way we approached it. Steven Forbes And then as a follow-up maybe expanding on recent learnings, can you touch on what you have gained so far from the Beyond+ beta test? I mean are you seeing improved traffic trends and maybe what channel is that customer migrating to and do you have insight right into whether or not you are actually gaining share of wallet with that membership program or loyalty program? Steven H. Temares Sure. Again, it's early. The results have been good basically across all the metrics that we are looking at. I think at this week or the end of this week we are planning on expanding the test group based upon those results. At the same time, there are things about it like really when we look at the lifetime value of the customer, we are very early into that lifetime analysis. So we really have to understand over time to what we are seeing, does it continue, the types of products that they migrate, our customer migrates to, how often they are shopping, the shipping expenses associated with it. So it's still early but everything so far has been favorable and we will be expanding the test later this week. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman My first question is on online growth. You've seen some really healthy growth, 20% plus, for some time now. Can you give us a sense of what's working well online, what are you learning from the expanded assortment that you have online now? And then, as it seems to be cannibalizing the store to some extent, is it causing you to rethink the store format at all, how many stores you have today and ultimately what the offering looks like in that store? Steven H. Temares Sure. We could start with the backend of the question about the store format. I mean, we have been evolving the store format and continue to evolve it. Years ago we started anticipating foot traffic declining, expense structure increasing with the wage structure. The writing is on the wall and it's only accelerated over time. So, it's the smaller stores, the combining of the different offerings, all these things were underway and we continued to do those things and we only have stores obviously to the extent they make sense and those stores are in a market that with those stores were more profitable than without those stores. And there are other benefits just besides the four-wall profitability of the store because we also look at the benefits that we get in the digital world and the fact that we are able to – we benefit from the fact that we have a presence in a market for reduced advertising expense, convenience for the customer to reserve online pickup in store, for people to start or schedule appointments and initiate registry services in stores for other people to shop online for them. So there are so many benefits that go both ways. And the idea that that's cannibalization, that's a tough one to say because whether we do it or somebody else does it, the movement is to digital. And so the fact that we are getting better at digital, that we are adding to our assortment, that we are improving our search, that we are improving our content, that we are improving the speed at the backend, if everything is improving with our site, that's great. The notion that it increases cannibalization is a tough one to really assess because, again, that customer is choosing to shop in a digital world, and if they didn't shop us, they would shop someplace else. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I guess just in the shorter term, as we think about the comp guidance for flat to slightly positive this year, any considerations as it relates to the cadence and maybe how you are trending early here in the first quarter? I think last year in the first quarter you had some headwinds related to the Memorial Day shift. I think there was an advertising shift as well. Should we assume that comps continue to improve here sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Susan E. Lattmann Seth, we have provided the full your guidance as you mentioned of a comp increase of relatively flat to slightly positive, and that considers what we have seen to date through the first quarter. Other than that, we gave a full year range. Seth Sigman Okay. I think you talked about lower earnings growth potentially in the first quarter due to some other issues but does that have anything to do with the comp difference and assumption in Q1 versus the rest of the year? Steven H. Temares I was just going to say that I think the primary reason that we pointed out is the tax implications. Susan E. Lattmann We did for Q1 and the comp guidance is for the full year, but again, it considers what we have seen to date. But as Steve mentioned, it was really Q1, the lighter EPS modelling that we did was due in part to the tax rate change that we discussed. Seth Sigman Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane I wondered if we could get any more color on your shipping strategy, how you are thinking about some of the changes that you have made to the shipping fee, how you are thinking about free ship? And then what percentage of your customer can you get to within two days of your fulfillment center and stores? Steven H. Temares We have built out a distribution network to allow us to get second day delivery. I think it's well into the 90% of the U.S. population we'd be able to accomplish that. That's the strategy as far as the distribution, the location of the distribution centers. And then as well as you know that we have shipped from stores directly, so in every market we have the capability of shipping directly from our stores. As far as the strategy in the $29, I think we will be anniversarying, we've anniversaried the $29 and I think there is a little period of time where we blip and then we go back to the $49 from last year. But this year we have pretty much looked at it and modelled it at $29 for the year, and we think that that's – right now our assessment is that it's pretty much a sweet spot, but we are always looking at the competition. And obviously when we talk about shipping, we are talking about the Bed Bath shipping but each of the concepts have their own strategy and the tactics they use in connection with shipping, but if you are talking about Bed Bath, that's how we've modelled it out for $29 and we think that for the moment that seems to be where our customers – when we look at what our customer buys, the average purchase, particularly what they're buying, there seems to be a sweet spot for the moment. Kate McShane Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on the CapEx spend, I think you mentioned half of it was going to technology. Is there any way to bucket what technology that it is going to and how it differs to what you spent in 2016? Susan E. Lattmann So for 2017, we did say that more than half would be allocated towards technology in terms of the growing omni-channel capabilities. So that would include our Web-site, our phone and mobile apps. It also includes supporting continued SKUs being added online. We also discussed our customer service center that we'll be opening in Florida and the technology around opening that facility. So some of that is the items that I would say were included from a technology perspective in CapEx for next year. Operator And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser Steve, you've made some considerable operational expenditures and investments in the business over the last few years, yet you are still looking for sales to be flat or your comp sales to be flattish or slightly positive this year bringing income down by a meaningful amount. Do you think you are getting a suitable return on these investments, and if you are not, at what point do you slow the pace of investments and potentially look to contain costs? Steven H. Temares First of all, we are not going to cut ourselves to greatness, so that's again we can't say that strong enough. The investments we've been making have made us significantly better. Are we where we want to be? No. But where would we have been if we didn't make these investments is the question that we have to ask ourselves. The retail is littered with people who didn't invest enough or invested later and made the wrong decision. So that's not where we intend to be. So we do measure each of the things that we invest in, we have expectations for them, and we think that we are a much better company today than we were 18 months ago, that we were three years ago. But unfortunately, we could produce better earnings in a short term by cutting expenditures but we wouldn't be a better company and we would be setting ourselves up for failure, and what we want to do is set ourselves up for greatness and that's why these investments need to be made. Michael Lasser And how are you measuring that greatness? Does that greatness come with your operating margin stabilizing at some point or are you just looking to maximize and grow gross operating profit dollars? Steven H. Temares Again, it will be measured by our customers trusting us to be the expert for what we do, for the home related product and for these heart-related life events that we handle. So being the largest player of what we think is the best choice when it comes to bridal registry, when we look at our baby registry, when we look at our growing decorating business, when we look at our large back to college business, our large new mover business, our camp business, all these things and being the best at them and then being able to take these customers over time into analytics, know who our customer is, speak to them on a personalized basis and to be able to be more important to them and be their first choice, and that's something that's going to be [indiscernible] over time. I mean we cannot be and we won't be just a transactional merchandise and be meaningful, so we have to be trusted by our customers as an expert in this way and that's what we are focused on, and the things that we are doing in terms of the differentiated product, all these services and solutions that we offer our customer as we try to always keep an eye towards operational excellence, are the ways that we intend to deliver this for our customer and to accomplish our mission. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler My first question Steve relates to the category expansion that you executed primarily online under the core Bed Bath & Beyond heading. Now that you are a year plus into that effort, how are you thinking about its success, and quantitatively is this one of the factors that's contributing to the outsized 20% plus e-commerce growth that you're seeing? Steven H. Temares Matt, the addition to the assortment is contributing to that. And keep in mind that much of that product is vendor direct. So this isn't product that we take into our system, that we don't handle, that we don't have the cost associated, we don't have the markdown risks. But yes, this is advantageous to us from a sales perspective. Ultimately, this has to be quoted in a way that it's meaningful to the customer, that we have the right content, we have the right features and facets, that it makes good sense for the customer that they think of us for these categories, we can market toward these categories, and we are ways away from being there, but just the additional assortment in and of itself we are benefiting from. Matt Fassler Thank you. And then my second and follow-up question is most likely for Sue. So you have a couple of acquisitions that you executed over the past year. I guess PMall is quite seasonal as we understand it. So can you talk about what the seasonal fluctuations in that business will do to revenue and earnings in 2017 until you cycle the deal? Susan E. Lattmann As you've noted, PMall is more seasonal from a holiday perspective. Each of the holidays throughout the year, it is a nice business to have. So with Christmas being a bit stronger and then the rest of the year there are holidays where PMall does do some volume. So that's all I could really say in terms of a seasonal perspective. Steven H. Temares Actually I guess we also gave the information on how it affected the fourth quarter, the impact it had on SG&A and the impact it had on our gross margin, and if that's a relatively strong time of the year, you could extrapolate from that as well. Eugene A. Castagna Yes, and we acquired Personalization Mall at the end of November. So the December numbers were in our last year fourth quarter. So we will anniversary those numbers in next year's fourth quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adrienne Yih My question is on the DTC and the direct piece of the business. Where is it as of the end of last year? And as you look out maybe three to four years from now, where do you think the penetration ultimately resides, the balance between DTC, e-comm and brick-and-mortar? Steven H. Temares You are talking about direct from vendors? Adrienne Yih Online. Sorry, online, online sales. Steven H. Temares I don't think we break down those numbers. That's first of all. But most of what we are adding online has been and will be VDC. So from that perspective, you can anticipate that the penetration from that part of the business will be growing. I'm not trying to be evasive, so if you want to ask that question again, I might have missed what you were trying to get at. We don't give the exact numbers. Adrienne Yih I guess let me ask it a different way. So this earnings cycle I would say this is the first time that we have heard the number sort of 40% to 50% of people's ultimate sales call it in the next three to five years coming from the online channel and 50% of it coming from brick-and-mortar, and it was the first time that I have heard that number kind of well, well north of 30%. And so it kind of begs the question, in three to five years if you're planning now and you're thinking about that, how you look at your real estate footprint and how you plan for that ultimate penetration, if that's even something that you philosophically think is going to happen? Is that a better way of asking it? Steven H. Temares I don't want to be judgmental. But I understood that better. No, but I think it's a good question. And just so for clarity, we didn't say 40% or 50% you're saying. That's an industry number you are hearing. Adrienne Yih Correct, and it's a first. Steven H. Temares And we do believe that – and we do see the movement to the digital world and I think it has been more aggressive than most people had anticipated, and that's I think accurate, not the 40% or 50%, I don't think we could predict what it will be. But we have been gearing our real estate in anticipation of there being less foot traffic and more expensive to run. And so when we look at doing a deal or redoing a deal, is that we look at over the term of the lease, and sometimes that might only have to be five years, seven years or 10 years to make sense, and we look at estimating or anticipating reduction in foot traffic of a number depending upon the market could be 5% to 10%, we look at increases in the wage rate by market, we know what's on the books and what's being discussed, so whether it's going to be ramping up to $10, $11, $12 or $15 and what numbers are going to be like to that of other people in our building that have to go up as well, and we model it out. And right now we are only looking to do the stores if over that time of that lease we see four-wall profitability and that it makes sense to have that store in the market and we'd be more profitable for having that store than not having that store, meaning if the business went to our other stores, where would we be. So we are downsizing stores and in some cases we are increasing the size and consolidating stores. But every store we do has to make sense from that economic perspective, and we started doing that years ago. So we are in a very good position. I wish that there was – I think that we would be perceived differently perhaps if we went to market and say, we are closing 100 stores or 200 stores, but it doesn't make sense. If it does make sense at some point, we will. These stores are profitable and they are more profitable, these markets are more profitable for having the stores than consolidating. That's the situation today and we make those decisions as we go forward. But I think you are right on both accounts, is that the digital world is ramping up and ramping up quickly and that the bricks-and-mortar world will suffer for it and there will be ramifications, and one of those ramifications will be reduced occupancy cost. And what happens if the occupancy cost gets reduced? Stores that don't make sense today, make sense down the road. And as somebody asked earlier, I don't know if it was Steve or somebody else, but the format is changing also over time as we are looking to add more experiential aspects to the store, give customers more reasons for being there, we are trying to with our Beyond store we are handling all the store orders, these online orders in the stores. So these additional services that we are trying to offer through the stores, the appointment scheduling that we have in the stores, like we said the reserving online, picking up in stores, so all this is a purpose of having them as well. But we are fortune because we don't have a prototype, we don't have a 30,000 or 40,000 square foot store, they don't have to be the same in every market. So we have 8,000 to 9,000 square foot stores and 120,000 square foot. So we size them by market and we make economic sense by market and that's how we try to run the business intelligently and optimize our bottom line. Adrienne Yih That's very helpful. Thank you very much for that detail. Operator Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Oliver Wintermantel In today's multichannel world and where pricing becomes more competitive and sales shift online, so how do you think about your historic like more on the coupon side, how do you think that works in a more promotional and more online world with the coupon? Steven H. Temares The coupons are available to our customers online. At the same time, differentiated product is critical for us. We don't want to be, we've never wanted to be all about price and we have always been driven by merchandising. It's a critical differentiator for us and it needs to be going forward and more so than ever, so differentiated product is important. But the coupon is important. It's the value that we give to our customers. So being at the right price is something that we are focused on, that we crawl the Web, we look at our competitors and we have a pricing group that we are doing dynamic pricing today. So, all these things are in place to make sure that we are at the right price. But differentiated predict and then also to the degree that most items with a plug and a lot of our product is maintained by manufacturers, the pricing. So that's generally at the same price in the marketplace. So it's a significant focus for us, and over time as we have always said, we want to get to being more specific with the customer, understanding what drives their shopping pattern and what's the value to them and make sure we are speaking to them and that the value that we offer to them makes sense other than a general coupon. But we are not getting rid of the coupon, we understand how important it is and the value of it is. But we do need to migrate over time as we get more personalized with our shopper to understand what categories they shop, what they bought, what they are looking for, where they are and their buying patterns, and make sure that we are dealing with them accordingly. Oliver Wintermantel Got it. Thank you. And just a follow up on online sales, can you give us maybe, now that you have reduced your free shipping level to $29, how much of your product is shipping for free today with $29 versus $49? Steven H. Temares You're talking about just for the Bed Bath situation? So, I don't think we share that information, okay. We do know and we look at the shipping revenue and as we test things where we need to be to make sense of moving that threshold. But we do, like I said early on, it does appear to be a sweet spot for us when you look at what the average purchase is and what people are doing online. And when we have tested otherwise, right now that's absent competitive forces, that's where we anticipate being for now based upon that due diligence that we have done. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel So the first question I wanted to ask, I guess somewhat of a modelling question, maybe longer-term, so gross margins now have been under pressure for a while, down I think 20 plus quarters or so, and if I heard you correctly, in the guidance you talked about maybe a somewhat better trajectory in next year but it is still down. So as we think longer term, we recognize you don't give longer-term guidance, but just conceptually, is there a point at which given all that's going on we should see margins flatten out or even start to turn positive again, and for that to happen, what factors would have to come into play? Susan E. Lattmann The gross margin deleverage that we modelled for 2017, that rate we did model to be less than that of 2016. In terms of future modelling beyond that, we didn't share that, but in general there's many factors that would impact gross margin. For example, it's something Steve just discussed here, it's the free shipping thresholds. It's also I guess what I would say is margin in terms of mix of goods and products that are sold. It's also I would say including freight cost and whatnot. It would also depend on what folks are buying and that mix of product that they chose. So given all that and those many factors, it's not possible to say this is exactly when we would see no deleverage in the future. Those are the items that we watch and we look at, and obviously that's what we are striving towards. Brian Nagel Great, that's helpful. Then a follow-up question, maybe hopefully [indiscernible], with regards to online sales, so as evidenced by the pretty substantial growth you've had online, you guys are succeeding online, but I guess the question I have is, and I know there is an easy answer to this, who are you competing with online? I mean is it just Amazon or are there other companies playing in your space that you are competing with? And as you look at that competitive landscape right now, maybe Bed Bath & Beyond has been late to the online game, so if there are companies who are performing better, perhaps your markets are better [indiscernible], isn't it just a [indiscernible] mission amongst consumers because they were there earlier or is there some factor you think that play [indiscernible] what are the reasons the other companies are performing better online? Steven H. Temares I could think that online the truth is that we compete against many more people, that there are people that look for credible retailers, but a lot of people are searching for items or they are looking for inspiration in the furniture and decor area, and whomever shows up could be redeemed credible. And so there is a lot more competition online than there was in the four walls. So I think that's the reality. And when you say that there are things that you could do to increase your market share, and we do some of that obviously that are rational for us, but there are things that you could do that a little less rational, you could spend a lot more on your advertising to buy sales. I mean we have competitors that do that and that's part of the way that they choose to do business. So ultimately, we believe that having the right assortment, having best in class Web-site in terms of search, content, assortment to services that are attached to it, that combined with the omni-channel experience is a winning formula. But that short-term decision whether you are looking every day, your ad to sales ratio on your advertising for your online is something that you could play with on a daily basis, and you can for short-term periods, you can buy sales but at the expense of the bottom line. And then you have to ask yourself, what's the stickiness of that customer, the lifetime value of the customer, you make a lot of assumptions and you test into it and you look back on to see if you were right or wrong. But the idea about the whole thing about market share is a tough one because when we look at us for example coming out of the fourth quarter, I guess there was a number of our competitors who are all great competitors, the William Sonomas, the Targets, the Macy's, the Kohl's, the Restorations, all these people had not great quarters. And so, are we gaining market share, they are losing market share or the people shop a little bit less in our category and so maybe the whole market share, the whole market was a little bit lower. We don't have finite numbers to know those answers, but clearly our digital space is growing at a rapid pace and we believe we are gaining market share. We think that we are experiencing in our stores is similar or perhaps slightly better than what we see happening in the general retail marketplace. So if those are correct conclusions, we would say that perhaps we are picking up market share, but we are not satisfied and it's very negligible one way or the other to really understand if that's the case. Does that answer the question, Brian? Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst This is [indiscernible] on for Dan. In light of all the retail store closures that are coming this year, several of these retailers compete in categories that overlap categories that you compete in. So given this, how do you assess the promotional environment that you see over the year and are there any particular quarters where you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure from heightened promotional activity? Steven H. Temares I don't think that we will know that. In fact I think that we didn't see necessarily or know exactly when Linens-N-Things are in 3-D or [Strauss] [ph] or [indiscernible] or Home Express or Pacific Linens or JCPenney Home Stores, [indiscernible] people were closing stores. We didn't know that Macy's was going to close those stores or that Penney was closing those stores or what's going to happen with Sears and Kmart. So we really can't tell you or predict a particular point in time that the competitive landscape shifts. But when it shifts, we anticipate that in the short-term there is some pain and in the long-term there is benefit. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman First question just on guidance, just two quick parts, the comp guidance, little flatfish to slightly positive for next year, can you just [indiscernible] what's the confidence? I know it's a slight improvement. Looks like home furnishing retail sales are a little weaker than they were let's say 12 months ago. And then Sue, can you tell us about what's the embedded EBIT margin in the guidance or a range? Susan E. Lattmann Okay, so starting with the comp guidance, we are coming off of a Q4 which was a positive 0.4 comp. I think Steve discussed some of the initiatives, whether it's furniture initiatives, personalization initiatives becoming more inspirational. Those are things we are working on throughout the year. And coming off that positive 0.4 comp, that's our model, that's where we see for now for modeling purposes and we will update it as the year progresses. Your second question I believe was on EBIT margin? Simeon Gutman Correct, yes. If you could just share what's the implied range within the EPS guidance? Steven H. Temares I don't think we provided that. We did say that the tax rate would be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016. Susan E. Lattmann We did. Steven H. Temares Interest should be relatively flat year-over-year, at least we believe it will be. So I guess the EBIT range would be slightly better than the EPS range on a per share basis, but we didn't give details about that. Simeon Gutman Okay. And my follow-up, if you look at back at 2016, could you have accelerated some of the investments, therefore that leaves some less to do in 2017, and then thinking about 2017, realize this may be a never evolving answer, but you've probably been asked multiple times, does this year represent the peak investment period, et cetera? Again, it's evolving, but any sense on that, can you answer that with clarity at this point? Susan E. Lattmann We provided our model which is around $400 million to $425 million. We came in at around $374 million for 2016. And so if you go back and you look historically, that's a peak for us at $374 million and we see that plateauing in that range of the model and where we ended up certainly for 2017. A CapEx model is fluid. Things happen throughout the year. Sometimes we are accelerating certain projects that we didn't originally plan and sometimes due to sequential basis we are pushing projects out. And then sometimes there are projects that we didn't even initially planned that we end up partway through the year make sense, whether it's for strategic reasons or financial reasons. So, we make those decisions as we go and that's our best model estimate at this time. Operator Our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas One of the things the Company has done very well over the years is to take products from teams that it has acquired like Harmon and buybuy BABY and integrated into the core Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Could you maybe talk about what inning you are in with Harmon and buybuy BABY products and some of the other ones, and what role, if any, you see for some of the online brands to have a presence in the Bed Bath & Beyond stores? Steven H. Temares I think that you could look at the Web-site to see the numbers of Harmon, where the health and beauty care, the four departments, I think it's a couple of hundred I think is the number there. I'm not giving any trade secrets. So I think there is an opportunity as we go forward for that. I think the buybuy BABY departments in the store are very few relative to that even. And so all those are opportunities to do more of this as we rollover real estate opportunities, because when we opened up those stores they weren't sized for those additional departments and things that we have in the store are very productive and obviously Harmon is commodity goods and Baby margins are in Bed Bath margin. So that's things that will evolve over time and the cost of the real estate and all those things will play into what the stores look like going forward. As far as the other online brands, I mean when we look at for example the PMall and the opportunity for them to create personalized product, we talked about them being seasonal and the opportunity for them to use all their processes and to provide product to Bed Bath & Beyond for example, that's a significant opportunity for us. So that's something that we are all working on so that we do see and we were growing personalized products in our stores. Again, that's another differentiator for us, so we think that's important. When you talk about somebody like a Decorist, we've looked at the ability to provide additional services, decorating services within stores. One Kings Lane had the studio in San Francisco, a studio in New York, and that's part of their – and they just opened up something that's a hybrid situation in Connecticut which we think was very interesting. So the ability to provide that decorating service in some of the Bed Bath & Beyond stores is an opportunity. When you look at the fact that we are growing furniture and home decor online, the ability to take some of that furniture, whether it would be One Kings Lane or other furniture offerings can show it to some degree in a way in our stores so customers understand that we are in the furniture business, so that's a growing opportunity for us as well. But in each of these areas is that we do have to figure out the right points of integration so the customer understands that we have the product that they are looking for, for the entire home and that we can be trusted as the expert for the home. So these are all things that are being done, some are further along than others and the ones that you pointed to, Harmon is further along, and Baby, we have certain departments in certain parts of the country that take advantage of the Christmas Tree Shops seasonal merchandise because they do such a wonderful job at seasonal. So you could find that in Bed Bath & Beyond stores. So all of this is something that very much continues to be a work in progress, but over time I think you will see more of it and we'll leverage it to a greater degree. Bradley Thomas Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Laura Champine When you talk about adding more furniture into your stores, what do you move out to make room for that, or is this new assortment just going in into expanded and remodelled stores? Steven H. Temares Obviously again you are talking about Bed Bath, because in furniture already you could find furniture at Cost Plus, you could find furniture at the Baby, obviously it's a significant and important part of the Baby assortment. That Christmas Tree sells furniture in Bed Bath, sells certain furniture. But again, there is different thought process and different things that we've been testing. But if you even take a look, I don't know if you have had an opportunity to see the studio experience at One Kings Lane, in a small amount of space you could really explain to the customer that you're in this business. So you might not necessarily sell much out of the store or carry much in the store, but you can really show the customer that we are in these businesses, we stand for these businesses, and explain that they can find it online, because even when you go into a Restoration, their offering is limited relative to you find somebody walking around with a tablet and they show you the breadth of the assortment. So really the key is, we don't expect, and we are not saying that we're going to be a furniture store, but how do we get across to the customer that we are in the furniture business and the stores don't become a disadvantage where people say or think you're not in the furniture business because we don't show it at all and the store explains to the customer that we are in the business. Laura Champine Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. David This is David on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question. Steven, I wanted to follow up with the answer you were just giving. So in terms of making customers aware of all the product lines and businesses that Bed Bath & Beyond stands for, what do you see going forward as you having to do to achieve that goal? Is it spending more in advertising, is it leveraging the customer less and doing more targeted marketing? How do you think about it and what does it mean for some of the operating expenses and capital expenditures going forward? Steven H. Temares For the first place obviously is that you could address it in our stores, that if the people, if our customers coming to the stores understood that we had an expanded assortment, that would be wonderful. So there is a lot of ways to do that that are not big capital expenditures. And then what we do already, and there is a shift in what we do, so there is a shift in where we spend our dollars and how we spend the dollars. So how do you – what are in your e-mail campaigns, what are in your CRM programs, what are you doing with your catalogs, what are you showing, how much are you showing and how you are describing to the customers. So, a great deal of it could be achieved through a shift. And then obviously it's spending more to the degree that it drives the returns we're looking for, that would be wonderful as well. So there is a lot of things that can be done. So really we haven't even addressed the customers that walk into our stores and really have done a sufficient job of letting that customer know the categories we are growing, and again, we haven't been in a rush to do that because we don't believe in many categories we are at the point that we are rushing to get the customer there because we are presenting the merchandise in a way with content and features and facets and shopability in a way that makes it best in class. So as we go down the road of shoring rooms and being inspirational and showing having the photography right and having the content right and having the chat up to speed so that we can answer the questions, and having our vendors up to speed so they could deliver appropriately and that we could deliver to people's homes with White Glove delivery and we could deliver out of our stores with the third-party partners who could pick it up and deliver it for the customers, and so all these things are more in place. We are not in a rush to show the customer we do something not great. So when we do things, we get to the point where we think that we're doing it well enough or great. The last part and the easy part will be marketing to the customer. David Okay. And then to follow, the logical follow-up to that is, when do you think most of those things will be in place? Steven H. Temares It's a gamut, because for example like even the delivery, the delivery network, to get delivery right we signed at this very local to take the last mile on delivery, and that if somebody is delivering the sofa versus delivering a mirror, that there is going to be in a lot of cases different delivery service. So again, everything that we are doing has a different timeline and it's not as if we are going to wait for everything to be perfect before we start taking particular categories and shouting that we are in this business. But literally, if you go online today and you take a look at some of the categories, you look literally at how we show it or how easily it's shopped or shopable, there are things that we have a lot to be desired. You shouldn't be when you are looking at it for upholstery or you are looking for sizes or you are looking for certain looks or feels, again, it should be easy for the customer and we need to really to make sure that we are attributing product correctly, that we are showing it in a way that we are really resonating with the customer in being able to do certain things in an inspirational way, so that it's close to best-in-class at least as we try to get and will get to best-in-class. So, each of these things has a different timeline. David Okay. Thank you. Operator I would now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. Janet M. Barth Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us again on our next quarterly earnings call on June 22nd. Have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steven Forbes from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Steven Forbes I realize it's early, but just maybe given the opportunity, how have the level [indiscernible] Shop the Home collections performed relative to expectations, and then how do you think about building brand awareness as the destination for furniture in general, and are you targeting your best customers first for this, any color about how you are approaching the marketing aspect and brand building aspect of that opportunity? Steven H. Temares I think it's early first of all to really seeing and the traffic isn't of the type that like you said I think it's nowhere and it's into build, and we really haven't done a real lot of marketing around it yet. And it's the same thing with the furniture and home decor offering. I mean first, we are working hard to get the offering in place and to get the offering right. There's a lot of growth that has to take place there. So we really haven't done significant marketing around it. You might have seen the books that we did and they went out to a limited audience. There was the book that went out in fall and the one that went out now in the spring, and it's a small segment of our population, and it's really a cross-section right now as we are trying to get the learnings from a cross-section of our customers. We have our customers segmented and this is a tool to enable us to learn about each of their patterns hopefully over time. So initially that's the way we approached it. Steven Forbes And then as a follow-up maybe expanding on recent learnings, can you touch on what you have gained so far from the Beyond+ beta test? I mean are you seeing improved traffic trends and maybe what channel is that customer migrating to and do you have insight right into whether or not you are actually gaining share of wallet with that membership program or loyalty program? Steven H. Temares Sure. Again, it's early. The results have been good basically across all the metrics that we are looking at. I think at this week or the end of this week we are planning on expanding the test group based upon those results. At the same time, there are things about it like really when we look at the lifetime value of the customer, we are very early into that lifetime analysis. So we really have to understand over time to what we are seeing, does it continue, the types of products that they migrate, our customer migrates to, how often they are shopping, the shipping expenses associated with it. So it's still early but everything so far has been favorable and we will be expanding the test later this week. Operator Our next question comes from Seth Sigman from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Seth Sigman My first question is on online growth. You've seen some really healthy growth, 20% plus, for some time now. Can you give us a sense of what's working well online, what are you learning from the expanded assortment that you have online now? And then, as it seems to be cannibalizing the store to some extent, is it causing you to rethink the store format at all, how many stores you have today and ultimately what the offering looks like in that store? Steven H. Temares Sure. We could start with the backend of the question about the store format. I mean, we have been evolving the store format and continue to evolve it. Years ago we started anticipating foot traffic declining, expense structure increasing with the wage structure. The writing is on the wall and it's only accelerated over time. So, it's the smaller stores, the combining of the different offerings, all these things were underway and we continued to do those things and we only have stores obviously to the extent they make sense and those stores are in a market that with those stores were more profitable than without those stores. And there are other benefits just besides the four-wall profitability of the store because we also look at the benefits that we get in the digital world and the fact that we are able to – we benefit from the fact that we have a presence in a market for reduced advertising expense, convenience for the customer to reserve online pickup in store, for people to start or schedule appointments and initiate registry services in stores for other people to shop online for them. So there are so many benefits that go both ways. And the idea that that's cannibalization, that's a tough one to say because whether we do it or somebody else does it, the movement is to digital. And so the fact that we are getting better at digital, that we are adding to our assortment, that we are improving our search, that we are improving our content, that we are improving the speed at the backend, if everything is improving with our site, that's great. The notion that it increases cannibalization is a tough one to really assess because, again, that customer is choosing to shop in a digital world, and if they didn't shop us, they would shop someplace else. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then my follow-up question, I guess just in the shorter term, as we think about the comp guidance for flat to slightly positive this year, any considerations as it relates to the cadence and maybe how you are trending early here in the first quarter? I think last year in the first quarter you had some headwinds related to the Memorial Day shift. I think there was an advertising shift as well. Should we assume that comps continue to improve here sequentially versus what we saw in the fourth quarter? Susan E. Lattmann Seth, we have provided the full your guidance as you mentioned of a comp increase of relatively flat to slightly positive, and that considers what we have seen to date through the first quarter. Other than that, we gave a full year range. Seth Sigman Okay. I think you talked about lower earnings growth potentially in the first quarter due to some other issues but does that have anything to do with the comp difference and assumption in Q1 versus the rest of the year? Steven H. Temares I was just going to say that I think the primary reason that we pointed out is the tax implications. Susan E. Lattmann We did for Q1 and the comp guidance is for the full year, but again, it considers what we have seen to date. But as Steve mentioned, it was really Q1, the lighter EPS modelling that we did was due in part to the tax rate change that we discussed. Seth Sigman Okay. Thanks very much. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane I wondered if we could get any more color on your shipping strategy, how you are thinking about some of the changes that you have made to the shipping fee, how you are thinking about free ship? And then what percentage of your customer can you get to within two days of your fulfillment center and stores? Steven H. Temares We have built out a distribution network to allow us to get second day delivery. I think it's well into the 90% of the U.S. population we'd be able to accomplish that. That's the strategy as far as the distribution, the location of the distribution centers. And then as well as you know that we have shipped from stores directly, so in every market we have the capability of shipping directly from our stores. As far as the strategy in the $29, I think we will be anniversarying, we've anniversaried the $29 and I think there is a little period of time where we blip and then we go back to the $49 from last year. But this year we have pretty much looked at it and modelled it at $29 for the year, and we think that that's – right now our assessment is that it's pretty much a sweet spot, but we are always looking at the competition. And obviously when we talk about shipping, we are talking about the Bed Bath shipping but each of the concepts have their own strategy and the tactics they use in connection with shipping, but if you are talking about Bed Bath, that's how we've modelled it out for $29 and we think that for the moment that seems to be where our customers – when we look at what our customer buys, the average purchase, particularly what they're buying, there seems to be a sweet spot for the moment. Kate McShane Okay, great. And then if I could just follow up on the CapEx spend, I think you mentioned half of it was going to technology. Is there any way to bucket what technology that it is going to and how it differs to what you spent in 2016? Susan E. Lattmann So for 2017, we did say that more than half would be allocated towards technology in terms of the growing omni-channel capabilities. So that would include our Web-site, our phone and mobile apps. It also includes supporting continued SKUs being added online. We also discussed our customer service center that we'll be opening in Florida and the technology around opening that facility. So some of that is the items that I would say were included from a technology perspective in CapEx for next year. Operator And our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser Steve, you've made some considerable operational expenditures and investments in the business over the last few years, yet you are still looking for sales to be flat or your comp sales to be flattish or slightly positive this year bringing income down by a meaningful amount. Do you think you are getting a suitable return on these investments, and if you are not, at what point do you slow the pace of investments and potentially look to contain costs? Steven H. Temares First of all, we are not going to cut ourselves to greatness, so that's again we can't say that strong enough. The investments we've been making have made us significantly better. Are we where we want to be? No. But where would we have been if we didn't make these investments is the question that we have to ask ourselves. The retail is littered with people who didn't invest enough or invested later and made the wrong decision. So that's not where we intend to be. So we do measure each of the things that we invest in, we have expectations for them, and we think that we are a much better company today than we were 18 months ago, that we were three years ago. But unfortunately, we could produce better earnings in a short term by cutting expenditures but we wouldn't be a better company and we would be setting ourselves up for failure, and what we want to do is set ourselves up for greatness and that's why these investments need to be made. Michael Lasser And how are you measuring that greatness? Does that greatness come with your operating margin stabilizing at some point or are you just looking to maximize and grow gross operating profit dollars? Steven H. Temares Again, it will be measured by our customers trusting us to be the expert for what we do, for the home related product and for these heart-related life events that we handle. So being the largest player of what we think is the best choice when it comes to bridal registry, when we look at our baby registry, when we look at our growing decorating business, when we look at our large back to college business, our large new mover business, our camp business, all these things and being the best at them and then being able to take these customers over time into analytics, know who our customer is, speak to them on a personalized basis and to be able to be more important to them and be their first choice, and that's something that's going to be [indiscernible] over time. I mean we cannot be and we won't be just a transactional merchandise and be meaningful, so we have to be trusted by our customers as an expert in this way and that's what we are focused on, and the things that we are doing in terms of the differentiated product, all these services and solutions that we offer our customer as we try to always keep an eye towards operational excellence, are the ways that we intend to deliver this for our customer and to accomplish our mission. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matt Fassler My first question Steve relates to the category expansion that you executed primarily online under the core Bed Bath & Beyond heading. Now that you are a year plus into that effort, how are you thinking about its success, and quantitatively is this one of the factors that's contributing to the outsized 20% plus e-commerce growth that you're seeing? Steven H. Temares Matt, the addition to the assortment is contributing to that. And keep in mind that much of that product is vendor direct. So this isn't product that we take into our system, that we don't handle, that we don't have the cost associated, we don't have the markdown risks. But yes, this is advantageous to us from a sales perspective. Ultimately, this has to be quoted in a way that it's meaningful to the customer, that we have the right content, we have the right features and facets, that it makes good sense for the customer that they think of us for these categories, we can market toward these categories, and we are ways away from being there, but just the additional assortment in and of itself we are benefiting from. Matt Fassler Thank you. And then my second and follow-up question is most likely for Sue. So you have a couple of acquisitions that you executed over the past year. I guess PMall is quite seasonal as we understand it. So can you talk about what the seasonal fluctuations in that business will do to revenue and earnings in 2017 until you cycle the deal? Susan E. Lattmann As you've noted, PMall is more seasonal from a holiday perspective. Each of the holidays throughout the year, it is a nice business to have. So with Christmas being a bit stronger and then the rest of the year there are holidays where PMall does do some volume. So that's all I could really say in terms of a seasonal perspective. Steven H. Temares Actually I guess we also gave the information on how it affected the fourth quarter, the impact it had on SG&A and the impact it had on our gross margin, and if that's a relatively strong time of the year, you could extrapolate from that as well. Eugene A. Castagna Yes, and we acquired Personalization Mall at the end of November. So the December numbers were in our last year fourth quarter. So we will anniversary those numbers in next year's fourth quarter. Operator Our next question comes from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Adrienne Yih My question is on the DTC and the direct piece of the business. Where is it as of the end of last year? And as you look out maybe three to four years from now, where do you think the penetration ultimately resides, the balance between DTC, e-comm and brick-and-mortar? Steven H. Temares You are talking about direct from vendors? Adrienne Yih Online. Sorry, online, online sales. Steven H. Temares I don't think we break down those numbers. That's first of all. But most of what we are adding online has been and will be VDC. So from that perspective, you can anticipate that the penetration from that part of the business will be growing. I'm not trying to be evasive, so if you want to ask that question again, I might have missed what you were trying to get at. We don't give the exact numbers. Adrienne Yih I guess let me ask it a different way. So this earnings cycle I would say this is the first time that we have heard the number sort of 40% to 50% of people's ultimate sales call it in the next three to five years coming from the online channel and 50% of it coming from brick-and-mortar, and it was the first time that I have heard that number kind of well, well north of 30%. And so it kind of begs the question, in three to five years if you're planning now and you're thinking about that, how you look at your real estate footprint and how you plan for that ultimate penetration, if that's even something that you philosophically think is going to happen? Is that a better way of asking it? Steven H. Temares I don't want to be judgmental. But I understood that better. No, but I think it's a good question. And just so for clarity, we didn't say 40% or 50% you're saying. That's an industry number you are hearing. Adrienne Yih Correct, and it's a first. Steven H. Temares And we do believe that – and we do see the movement to the digital world and I think it has been more aggressive than most people had anticipated, and that's I think accurate, not the 40% or 50%, I don't think we could predict what it will be. But we have been gearing our real estate in anticipation of there being less foot traffic and more expensive to run. And so when we look at doing a deal or redoing a deal, is that we look at over the term of the lease, and sometimes that might only have to be five years, seven years or 10 years to make sense, and we look at estimating or anticipating reduction in foot traffic of a number depending upon the market could be 5% to 10%, we look at increases in the wage rate by market, we know what's on the books and what's being discussed, so whether it's going to be ramping up to $10, $11, $12 or $15 and what numbers are going to be like to that of other people in our building that have to go up as well, and we model it out. And right now we are only looking to do the stores if over that time of that lease we see four-wall profitability and that it makes sense to have that store in the market and we'd be more profitable for having that store than not having that store, meaning if the business went to our other stores, where would we be. So we are downsizing stores and in some cases we are increasing the size and consolidating stores. But every store we do has to make sense from that economic perspective, and we started doing that years ago. So we are in a very good position. I wish that there was – I think that we would be perceived differently perhaps if we went to market and say, we are closing 100 stores or 200 stores, but it doesn't make sense. If it does make sense at some point, we will. These stores are profitable and they are more profitable, these markets are more profitable for having the stores than consolidating. That's the situation today and we make those decisions as we go forward. But I think you are right on both accounts, is that the digital world is ramping up and ramping up quickly and that the bricks-and-mortar world will suffer for it and there will be ramifications, and one of those ramifications will be reduced occupancy cost. And what happens if the occupancy cost gets reduced? Stores that don't make sense today, make sense down the road. And as somebody asked earlier, I don't know if it was Steve or somebody else, but the format is changing also over time as we are looking to add more experiential aspects to the store, give customers more reasons for being there, we are trying to with our Beyond store we are handling all the store orders, these online orders in the stores. So these additional services that we are trying to offer through the stores, the appointment scheduling that we have in the stores, like we said the reserving online, picking up in stores, so all this is a purpose of having them as well. But we are fortune because we don't have a prototype, we don't have a 30,000 or 40,000 square foot store, they don't have to be the same in every market. So we have 8,000 to 9,000 square foot stores and 120,000 square foot. So we size them by market and we make economic sense by market and that's how we try to run the business intelligently and optimize our bottom line. Adrienne Yih That's very helpful. Thank you very much for that detail. Operator Our next question comes from Oliver Wintermantel from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Oliver Wintermantel In today's multichannel world and where pricing becomes more competitive and sales shift online, so how do you think about your historic like more on the coupon side, how do you think that works in a more promotional and more online world with the coupon? Steven H. Temares The coupons are available to our customers online. At the same time, differentiated product is critical for us. We don't want to be, we've never wanted to be all about price and we have always been driven by merchandising. It's a critical differentiator for us and it needs to be going forward and more so than ever, so differentiated product is important. But the coupon is important. It's the value that we give to our customers. So being at the right price is something that we are focused on, that we crawl the Web, we look at our competitors and we have a pricing group that we are doing dynamic pricing today. So, all these things are in place to make sure that we are at the right price. But differentiated predict and then also to the degree that most items with a plug and a lot of our product is maintained by manufacturers, the pricing. So that's generally at the same price in the marketplace. So it's a significant focus for us, and over time as we have always said, we want to get to being more specific with the customer, understanding what drives their shopping pattern and what's the value to them and make sure we are speaking to them and that the value that we offer to them makes sense other than a general coupon. But we are not getting rid of the coupon, we understand how important it is and the value of it is. But we do need to migrate over time as we get more personalized with our shopper to understand what categories they shop, what they bought, what they are looking for, where they are and their buying patterns, and make sure that we are dealing with them accordingly. Oliver Wintermantel Got it. Thank you. And just a follow up on online sales, can you give us maybe, now that you have reduced your free shipping level to $29, how much of your product is shipping for free today with $29 versus $49? Steven H. Temares You're talking about just for the Bed Bath situation? So, I don't think we share that information, okay. We do know and we look at the shipping revenue and as we test things where we need to be to make sense of moving that threshold. But we do, like I said early on, it does appear to be a sweet spot for us when you look at what the average purchase is and what people are doing online. And when we have tested otherwise, right now that's absent competitive forces, that's where we anticipate being for now based upon that due diligence that we have done. Operator And our next question comes from Brian Nagel from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Brian Nagel So the first question I wanted to ask, I guess somewhat of a modelling question, maybe longer-term, so gross margins now have been under pressure for a while, down I think 20 plus quarters or so, and if I heard you correctly, in the guidance you talked about maybe a somewhat better trajectory in next year but it is still down. So as we think longer term, we recognize you don't give longer-term guidance, but just conceptually, is there a point at which given all that's going on we should see margins flatten out or even start to turn positive again, and for that to happen, what factors would have to come into play? Susan E. Lattmann The gross margin deleverage that we modelled for 2017, that rate we did model to be less than that of 2016. In terms of future modelling beyond that, we didn't share that, but in general there's many factors that would impact gross margin. For example, it's something Steve just discussed here, it's the free shipping thresholds. It's also I guess what I would say is margin in terms of mix of goods and products that are sold. It's also I would say including freight cost and whatnot. It would also depend on what folks are buying and that mix of product that they chose. So given all that and those many factors, it's not possible to say this is exactly when we would see no deleverage in the future. Those are the items that we watch and we look at, and obviously that's what we are striving towards. Brian Nagel Great, that's helpful. Then a follow-up question, maybe hopefully [indiscernible], with regards to online sales, so as evidenced by the pretty substantial growth you've had online, you guys are succeeding online, but I guess the question I have is, and I know there is an easy answer to this, who are you competing with online? I mean is it just Amazon or are there other companies playing in your space that you are competing with? And as you look at that competitive landscape right now, maybe Bed Bath & Beyond has been late to the online game, so if there are companies who are performing better, perhaps your markets are better [indiscernible], isn't it just a [indiscernible] mission amongst consumers because they were there earlier or is there some factor you think that play [indiscernible] what are the reasons the other companies are performing better online? Steven H. Temares I could think that online the truth is that we compete against many more people, that there are people that look for credible retailers, but a lot of people are searching for items or they are looking for inspiration in the furniture and decor area, and whomever shows up could be redeemed credible. And so there is a lot more competition online than there was in the four walls. So I think that's the reality. And when you say that there are things that you could do to increase your market share, and we do some of that obviously that are rational for us, but there are things that you could do that a little less rational, you could spend a lot more on your advertising to buy sales. I mean we have competitors that do that and that's part of the way that they choose to do business. So ultimately, we believe that having the right assortment, having best in class Web-site in terms of search, content, assortment to services that are attached to it, that combined with the omni-channel experience is a winning formula. But that short-term decision whether you are looking every day, your ad to sales ratio on your advertising for your online is something that you could play with on a daily basis, and you can for short-term periods, you can buy sales but at the expense of the bottom line. And then you have to ask yourself, what's the stickiness of that customer, the lifetime value of the customer, you make a lot of assumptions and you test into it and you look back on to see if you were right or wrong. But the idea about the whole thing about market share is a tough one because when we look at us for example coming out of the fourth quarter, I guess there was a number of our competitors who are all great competitors, the William Sonomas, the Targets, the Macy's, the Kohl's, the Restorations, all these people had not great quarters. And so, are we gaining market share, they are losing market share or the people shop a little bit less in our category and so maybe the whole market share, the whole market was a little bit lower. We don't have finite numbers to know those answers, but clearly our digital space is growing at a rapid pace and we believe we are gaining market share. We think that we are experiencing in our stores is similar or perhaps slightly better than what we see happening in the general retail marketplace. So if those are correct conclusions, we would say that perhaps we are picking up market share, but we are not satisfied and it's very negligible one way or the other to really understand if that's the case. Does that answer the question, Brian? Okay. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst This is [indiscernible] on for Dan. In light of all the retail store closures that are coming this year, several of these retailers compete in categories that overlap categories that you compete in. So given this, how do you assess the promotional environment that you see over the year and are there any particular quarters where you anticipate a little bit more gross margin pressure from heightened promotional activity? Steven H. Temares I don't think that we will know that. In fact I think that we didn't see necessarily or know exactly when Linens-N-Things are in 3-D or [Strauss] [ph] or [indiscernible] or Home Express or Pacific Linens or JCPenney Home Stores, [indiscernible] people were closing stores. We didn't know that Macy's was going to close those stores or that Penney was closing those stores or what's going to happen with Sears and Kmart. So we really can't tell you or predict a particular point in time that the competitive landscape shifts. But when it shifts, we anticipate that in the short-term there is some pain and in the long-term there is benefit. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman First question just on guidance, just two quick parts, the comp guidance, little flatfish to slightly positive for next year, can you just [indiscernible] what's the confidence? I know it's a slight improvement. Looks like home furnishing retail sales are a little weaker than they were let's say 12 months ago. And then Sue, can you tell us about what's the embedded EBIT margin in the guidance or a range? Susan E. Lattmann Okay, so starting with the comp guidance, we are coming off of a Q4 which was a positive 0.4 comp. I think Steve discussed some of the initiatives, whether it's furniture initiatives, personalization initiatives becoming more inspirational. Those are things we are working on throughout the year. And coming off that positive 0.4 comp, that's our model, that's where we see for now for modeling purposes and we will update it as the year progresses. Your second question I believe was on EBIT margin? Simeon Gutman Correct, yes. If you could just share what's the implied range within the EPS guidance? Steven H. Temares I don't think we provided that. We did say that the tax rate would be higher in 2017 than it was in 2016. Susan E. Lattmann We did. Steven H. Temares Interest should be relatively flat year-over-year, at least we believe it will be. So I guess the EBIT range would be slightly better than the EPS range on a per share basis, but we didn't give details about that. Simeon Gutman Okay. And my follow-up, if you look at back at 2016, could you have accelerated some of the investments, therefore that leaves some less to do in 2017, and then thinking about 2017, realize this may be a never evolving answer, but you've probably been asked multiple times, does this year represent the peak investment period, et cetera? Again, it's evolving, but any sense on that, can you answer that with clarity at this point? Susan E. Lattmann We provided our model which is around $400 million to $425 million. We came in at around $374 million for 2016. And so if you go back and you look historically, that's a peak for us at $374 million and we see that plateauing in that range of the model and where we ended up certainly for 2017. A CapEx model is fluid. Things happen throughout the year. Sometimes we are accelerating certain projects that we didn't originally plan and sometimes due to sequential basis we are pushing projects out. And then sometimes there are projects that we didn't even initially planned that we end up partway through the year make sense, whether it's for strategic reasons or financial reasons. So, we make those decisions as we go and that's our best model estimate at this time. Operator Our next question comes from Brad Thomas from KeyBanc. Please go ahead. Bradley Thomas One of the things the Company has done very well over the years is to take products from teams that it has acquired like Harmon and buybuy BABY and integrated into the core Bed Bath & Beyond stores. Could you maybe talk about what inning you are in with Harmon and buybuy BABY products and some of the other ones, and what role, if any, you see for some of the online brands to have a presence in the Bed Bath & Beyond stores? Steven H. Temares I think that you could look at the Web-site to see the numbers of Harmon, where the health and beauty care, the four departments, I think it's a couple of hundred I think is the number there. I'm not giving any trade secrets. So I think there is an opportunity as we go forward for that. I think the buybuy BABY departments in the store are very few relative to that even. And so all those are opportunities to do more of this as we rollover real estate opportunities, because when we opened up those stores they weren't sized for those additional departments and things that we have in the store are very productive and obviously Harmon is commodity goods and Baby margins are in Bed Bath margin. So that's things that will evolve over time and the cost of the real estate and all those things will play into what the stores look like going forward. As far as the other online brands, I mean when we look at for example the PMall and the opportunity for them to create personalized product, we talked about them being seasonal and the opportunity for them to use all their processes and to provide product to Bed Bath & Beyond for example, that's a significant opportunity for us. So that's something that we are all working on so that we do see and we were growing personalized products in our stores. Again, that's another differentiator for us, so we think that's important. When you talk about somebody like a Decorist, we've looked at the ability to provide additional services, decorating services within stores. One Kings Lane had the studio in San Francisco, a studio in New York, and that's part of their – and they just opened up something that's a hybrid situation in Connecticut which we think was very interesting. So the ability to provide that decorating service in some of the Bed Bath & Beyond stores is an opportunity. When you look at the fact that we are growing furniture and home decor online, the ability to take some of that furniture, whether it would be One Kings Lane or other furniture offerings can show it to some degree in a way in our stores so customers understand that we are in the furniture business, so that's a growing opportunity for us as well. But in each of these areas is that we do have to figure out the right points of integration so the customer understands that we have the product that they are looking for, for the entire home and that we can be trusted as the expert for the home. So these are all things that are being done, some are further along than others and the ones that you pointed to, Harmon is further along, and Baby, we have certain departments in certain parts of the country that take advantage of the Christmas Tree Shops seasonal merchandise because they do such a wonderful job at seasonal. So you could find that in Bed Bath & Beyond stores. So all of this is something that very much continues to be a work in progress, but over time I think you will see more of it and we'll leverage it to a greater degree. Bradley Thomas Great. Thank you very much. Operator Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Laura Champine When you talk about adding more furniture into your stores, what do you move out to make room for that, or is this new assortment just going in into expanded and remodelled stores? Steven H. Temares Obviously again you are talking about Bed Bath, because in furniture already you could find furniture at Cost Plus, you could find furniture at the Baby, obviously it's a significant and important part of the Baby assortment. That Christmas Tree sells furniture in Bed Bath, sells certain furniture. But again, there is different thought process and different things that we've been testing. But if you even take a look, I don't know if you have had an opportunity to see the studio experience at One Kings Lane, in a small amount of space you could really explain to the customer that you're in this business. So you might not necessarily sell much out of the store or carry much in the store, but you can really show the customer that we are in these businesses, we stand for these businesses, and explain that they can find it online, because even when you go into a Restoration, their offering is limited relative to you find somebody walking around with a tablet and they show you the breadth of the assortment. So really the key is, we don't expect, and we are not saying that we're going to be a furniture store, but how do we get across to the customer that we are in the furniture business and the stores don't become a disadvantage where people say or think you're not in the furniture business because we don't show it at all and the store explains to the customer that we are in the business. Laura Champine Got it. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Budd Bugatch from Raymond James. Please go ahead. David This is David on for Budd. Thank you for taking my question. Steven, I wanted to follow up with the answer you were just giving. So in terms of making customers aware of all the product lines and businesses that Bed Bath & Beyond stands for, what do you see going forward as you having to do to achieve that goal? Is it spending more in advertising, is it leveraging the customer less and doing more targeted marketing? How do you think about it and what does it mean for some of the operating expenses and capital expenditures going forward? Steven H. Temares For the first place obviously is that you could address it in our stores, that if the people, if our customers coming to the stores understood that we had an expanded assortment, that would be wonderful. So there is a lot of ways to do that that are not big capital expenditures. And then what we do already, and there is a shift in what we do, so there is a shift in where we spend our dollars and how we spend the dollars. So how do you – what are in your e-mail campaigns, what are in your CRM programs, what are you doing with your catalogs, what are you showing, how much are you showing and how you are describing to the customers. So, a great deal of it could be achieved through a shift. And then obviously it's spending more to the degree that it drives the returns we're looking for, that would be wonderful as well. So there is a lot of things that can be done. So really we haven't even addressed the customers that walk into our stores and really have done a sufficient job of letting that customer know the categories we are growing, and again, we haven't been in a rush to do that because we don't believe in many categories we are at the point that we are rushing to get the customer there because we are presenting the merchandise in a way with content and features and facets and shopability in a way that makes it best in class. So as we go down the road of shoring rooms and being inspirational and showing having the photography right and having the content right and having the chat up to speed so that we can answer the questions, and having our vendors up to speed so they could deliver appropriately and that we could deliver to people's homes with White Glove delivery and we could deliver out of our stores with the third-party partners who could pick it up and deliver it for the customers, and so all these things are more in place. We are not in a rush to show the customer we do something not great. So when we do things, we get to the point where we think that we're doing it well enough or great. The last part and the easy part will be marketing to the customer. David Okay. And then to follow, the logical follow-up to that is, when do you think most of those things will be in place? Steven H. Temares It's a gamut, because for example like even the delivery, the delivery network, to get delivery right we signed at this very local to take the last mile on delivery, and that if somebody is delivering the sofa versus delivering a mirror, that there is going to be in a lot of cases different delivery service. So again, everything that we are doing has a different timeline and it's not as if we are going to wait for everything to be perfect before we start taking particular categories and shouting that we are in this business. But literally, if you go online today and you take a look at some of the categories, you look literally at how we show it or how easily it's shopped or shopable, there are things that we have a lot to be desired. You shouldn't be when you are looking at it for upholstery or you are looking for sizes or you are looking for certain looks or feels, again, it should be easy for the customer and we need to really to make sure that we are attributing product correctly, that we are showing it in a way that we are really resonating with the customer in being able to do certain things in an inspirational way, so that it's close to best-in-class at least as we try to get and will get to best-in-class. So, each of these things has a different timeline. David Okay. Thank you. Operator I would now turn the call back over to Janet Barth for closing remarks. Janet M. Barth Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to having you join us again on our next quarterly earnings call on June 22nd. Have a good evening. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Ashish Saran Thank you, Operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me today are Hock Tan, President and CEO; and Tom Krause, Chief Financial Officer of Broadcom Limited. After market close today, Broadcom distributed a press release and financial tables describing our financial performance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. If you did not receive a cope, you may obtain the information from the Investor section of Broadcom’s website at  www.broadcom.com . This conference call is being webcast live and a recording will be made available via telephone playback for one week. It will also be archived in the Investor section of our website at broadcom.com. During the prepared comments section of this call, Hock and Tom will be providing details of our first quarter year 2017 results, background to our second quarter fiscal year 2017 outlook, and some commentary regarding the business environment. We will take questions after the end of our prepared comments. In addition to U.S. GAAP reporting, Broadcom reports certain financial measures on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures is included in the tables attached to today’s press release. Comments made during today’s call will primarily refer to are non-GAAP financial results. Please refer to our press release today and our recent filings with the SEC for information on the specific risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on this call. At this time, I would like to turn the call over the Hock Tan. Hock? Hock Tan Thank you, Ashish. Good afternoon everyone. Well, we delivered strong financial results for the first quarter with revenue of $41.5 billion and gross margin at 62.4%, both at a very top end of our guidance. Earnings per share of $3.63 grew by 5% sequentially, while net revenue was essentially flat. Revenue was better than expected in all four segments. The benefits we achieved through business diversification clearly came through this quarter with growth in Wired, Enterprise Storage, and Industrial completely offsetting the typical negative seasonality from Wireless. The integration of classic Broadcom has gone very well and is now mostly complete. We remain focused on driving financial performance towards our long-term operating margin and free cash flow targets. Let me now turn to a discussion of our segment results, starting with Wired, our largest segment. In the first quarter, Wired revenue came in at $2.09 billion better than expected and represented 50% of our total revenue. Revenue for this segment was up slightly on a sequential basis, benefited from strong demand for Ethernet Switching and Routing products from cloud data center operators. This growth was partially offset by the continuing seasonal decline in demand for our broadband carrier access and set-top box products, which we expect to bottom in this first quarter. Turning to the second fiscal quarter, we forecast Wired revenue experience sequential growth a little bit stronger than what we saw in the prior quarter. We expect the momentum from cloud data center demand to sustain and expect a seasonal increase in demand for our broadband access and set-top box products. Now moving on to Wireless. In the first quarter, Wireless revenue came in at about $1.18 billion, better than expect and Wireless segment represented 28% of our total revenues. Revenue for this core segment was down 13% sequentially, driven by the expected seasonal decline in demand from a major North American customer. Turning now to our projection for the second quarter fiscal of 2017, we expect to hit the bottom of annual product cycle transition at a major North American customer. However, we expect to offset a significant portion of this decline in Wireless from a ramp of the next generation phone as our large Korean smartphone customer. This phone comes with an increase in Broadcom's RF and Wi-Fi connectivity content. As a result, we expect our Wireless revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 to be still sequentially down, but in the high single-digits better than the more typical double-digit declines we have experienced in prior years. Let me now turn to Enterprise Storage, which continues to be strong. In the first quarter, Enterprise Storage revenue came in at $707 million and this segment represented 17% of our total revenue. Segment revenue grew 26% sequentially, gaining better than expected driven by stronger shipments of SAS, RAID, and Fiber Channel products. As we foresaw, our hard disk drive and custom solid state drives controllers also had a very strong quarter. And looking into the second quarter, however, we believe this resurgence of Enterprise Storage has to taper off and hence flatten out. Having said that, backlog for Enterprise Storage products continues up to today to be very strong. But we foresaw what we foresee seasonality to start slowing demand in the third quarter if not in this -- late in the second quarter. Finally, turning to our last segment, Industrial. In the first quarter, Industrial revenue grew -- came in at $180 million, up 11% sequentially better than expected as we rebuild depleted channel inventory consistent with stronger product resales. The industrial segment represented 5% of our total revenue and as we look into the second quarter, we are anticipating industrial activity to continue to improve seasonally and accordingly, we are expecting industrial segment revenue to increase by high single-digits sequentially. With all that to sump-up -- to simply sum-up, this second quarter was strong, revenue flat from the seasonally high fourth quarter of the preceding year. As we know look into the second quarter, we expect this demand environment for our products to continue to be very healthy and our outlook for this quarter's revenue to be virtually flat to that of the prior quarter. It is becoming evident that our broader and more diversified product portfolio has largely mitigated seasonal impacts to consolidated revenue during the first half of the year. This is certainly an intrinsic goal of our business model just that we did not expect to achieve these so soon. The integration of classic Broadcom is clearly going well and we continue to invest across all our franchise products. We are sustaining our technology leadership and our products are very well received by our customers. Our revenue trajectory from the first half of fiscal 2017 could possibly extend into the second half. Nonetheless, we do not expect that the approximate 15% level of year-on-year growth we are guiding for the second quarter to really be sustainable in the long-term. Our long-term operating model will continue to assume mid-single-digit annual revenue growth for the consolidated business. With that let me now turn the call over to Tom for detailed review our first quarter fiscal 2017 financials. Tom Krause Thank you, Hock, good afternoon everyone. My comments today will focus primarily on our non-GAAP results from continuing operations unless otherwise specifically noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP data is included with the earnings release issued today that is available on our website at Broadcom.com. Let me first start out by saying that we are very pleased with the execution this quarter and specifically the progress we've made towards our long-term target model, which remains an operating margin target of 45% of net revenue and a free cash flow margin above 35% of net revenue. Further to what Hock was saying, we also believe that we can achieve these long-term operating targets based on a sustainable long-term revenue growth rate of mid-single-digits. Now, let me review the Q1 results. Revenue for the quarter came in at $4.15 billion, approximately flat sequentially. Foxconn was greater than 10% direct customer in the first fiscal quarter. Our first quarter gross margin from continuing operations was 62.4%, about 90 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to revenue at the top end of guidance and a slightly better product mix. This quarter's gross margin also benefitted from the impact of approximately $60 million of revenue related to the assignment of certain manufacturing rights to a customer in our Wired segment, which is included in our original guidance. Turning to OpEx, R&D expenses were $664 million and SG&A expenses were $120 million. This resulted in total operating expenses for the first quarter of $784 million, or 18.9% of net revenue. As Hock mentioned, we have not largely completed the integration of classic Broadcom and I would reiterate that we feel comfortable at this level of operating expenses relative net revenue. Operating income from continuing operations for the quarter was $1.8 billion and represented 43.5% of net revenue. Provision for taxes came in at $77 million, slightly above our guidance. This was primarily due to higher than expected net income. First quarter interest expense of $110 million and other income net was $8 million. First quarter net income was $1.63 billion and earnings per diluted share were $3.63. Our share-based compensation expense in the first quarter was $201 million. Moving on to the balance sheet, our days sales outstanding were 43 days, a decrease of five days from the prior quarter due to better linearity of revenue in the quarter. Our inventory ended at $1.34 billion, a decrease of $64 million from the beginning of the quarter. We generated $1.35 billion in operational cash flow, which reflected the impact of approximately $313 million for annual employee bonus payments for fiscal year 2016 and approximately $80 million of cash expended on classic Broadcom restructuring integration activities including discontinued operations. I'm very pleased that in the first quarter, the business already demonstrated the ability to generate free cash flow close to our long-term target model of 35%, while free cash flow in the first quarter was $1 billion approximately or only 25% of net revenue. This does include I want to highlight the impact from the annual employee cash bonus payment as well as cash restructuring expenses and capital expenditures that as we discussed before running higher than our long-term targets. Looking forward, we expect classic Broadcom related restructuring expenses to continue to decrease as we finish this integration. Capital expenditure in the first quarter was $325 million or 7.8% of net revenue. However, we expect long-term CapEx largely to fabless semiconductor company to run at about 3% of net revenue consistent with that fabless business model. As a reminder for full fiscal year 2017, we expect CapEx to run at an elevated level of approximately $1.2 billion. This includes about $500 million towards campus construction, primarily at our Irvine and San Jose locations and about $200 million towards purchasing of test equipment to consignment at our CMs. A total of $431 million in cash was spent on company dividend and partnership distribution payments in the first quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of approximately $3.5 billion. Now let me turn to non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. This guidance reflects our current assessment of business conditions and we do not intend to update this guidance. This guidance is for results from continuing operations only. Net revenue is expected to be $4.1 billion plus or minus $75 million. Gross margin is expected to be 62%, plus or minus 1 percentage point. Operating expenses are estimated to be approximately $789 million. Tax provision is forecasted to be approximately $74 million. Net interest expense and other is expected to be approximately $106 million. The diluted share count forecast is for 452 million shares. Share-based compensation expense will be approximately $223 million. CapEx will be approximately $290 million. And you have seen, our Board has declared a dividend of $1.02 per share to be paid later in the second fiscal quarter. We're also looking forward to completing the acquisition of Brocade, which is proceeding as planned and we presently expect to close this transaction in our third quarter of fiscal 2017. I'm pleased that we're able to reach an agreement with ARRIS earlier this quarter for the sale of Brocade's network edge business for $800 million in cash plus the additional cost of unvested employee stock awards. Following Brocade's recent results, we continue to feel very comfortable that Brocade's Fiber Channel San Switching business, the key business that we're focused on will generate approximately $900 million of EBITDA in fiscal 2018. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Ross Seymore Hey guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess Hock the first question is on the Wireless side. It's good to see the content rising at other customers besides just your big North American customer; can you talk a little bit more detail about what's driving that content up? Is there anything unique or is it basically the same goodness that you've seen in the North America side? And any more color about that goodness continuing on the North America side into the second half of this year would also be helpful. Thanks. Hock Tan Yes, Ross thanks for the question. Yes, it's -- in fact it's a phenomenon we have been indicating to you guys for the last several years which is over the medium term -- long-term, I would say, our strength of franchise in cellular and our RF cellular analog, the front end cellular analog, which includes FBAR and power amplifiers and all the circuitry and component that goes in front of the transceiver in the handset for cellular. That's one area and the other area in Wi-Fi Bluetooth connectivity. Those two functionality, those two features in phones continue to evolve and with each generation. And as each generation evolves, when it involves, in the case of RF cellular is two-fold. One is basically more band as we progress -- as more and more countries globally progress into 4G and eventually even further beyond that. More and more bands -- spectral bandwidths get pulled into the fold and number of skills of phones get less and less for any major OEM manufacturer simply because of complexity of these phones. And so because of more bands, it requires more filters, more components like power amplifiers -- low noise amplifiers and because of that necessary content increases. I should also add the difficulty of engineering those products increased fairly exponentially, which therefore drives towards better and better content for us into those very high-end flagship smartphones. In the case of wireless connectivity, the same phenomenon is happening and it's particularly driven on bandwidth on the peer [ph] throughput as we move from -- what we gradually move from what used to be much lower bandwidth in Wi-Fi to today's AC. As we move from to single users to multiple users and as we move next generation from AC into AX and further. Obviously, difficulty of doing those products in smartphones become correspondingly more difficult, content increases and we benefit from basically content increase. It's a normal phenomenon and we expect to see that continuing into the medium term. Ross Seymore Great, that's helpful. I guess for my one follow-up, both you and Tom, Hock, mentioned about the 15% growth not being your long-term assumption. Just wondering why you are bringing that up? Is there something you're seeing now that gives you pause that things are going to slow down or is this just a reminder that the level we are now is not the base assumption in your business model? Hock Tan I think the fairest way to answer that is we have articulated last fiscal year very clearly and even a year ago when we acquired Broadcom, as long as a year ago, that we were scaled and we were diversification of product portfolio. Our long-term model, out five years, 10 years is a compounded annual growth of 5%. Not every year necessarily, but long-term 5%. And why we feel the need to mention it is obviously you saw the numbers we were guiding for Q2 on the topline and they're showing 15% year-on-year from a year ago. That's just one quarter and obviously just one fiscal year, one point in time. So, we felt it necessary to just mention it that do not just take it and extrapolate it to say that we have move away from our broad model on guidance of 5% compounded annual growth in the long term to a 15%, far from it. Tom Krause And Ross, I mean just to add -- I also want to reiterate, we don't believe we need to have this accelerated revenue growth to hit our financial targets which we remain very focused on, specifically the free cash flow margins at 35%. We're very comfortable achieving those results based on a more normalized long-term CAGR of mid-single-digits. Ross Seymore Very well. Congrats on those results. Thanks a lot. Operator Your next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Blayne Curtis Hey guys thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great results. Just following-up on the Wireless guide, you've talked in the past sometimes it can be seasonal down 15%, 20% to the high single-digits. Just curious between contents and the units, what are you seeing with your two large customers in terms of the seasonality and the timing of the ramp magnitude versus the content gains you're seeing? Hock Tan To be -- I don't have specific data between to be able to speed out accurately between units and content, but off the cuff, my sense is it's largely content. Blayne Curtis Okay. And then you mentioned strength in switching, I was curious obviously you don't want to -- for a full year, I was just curious you talked about some businesses being soft in the second half. There's obviously a big upgrade cycle that's 2500G. Just curious your perspective as you look at the rest of the year the trajectory of the switch business? Hock Tan That's a very interesting question and on the switching side, which is a subset, obviously, of our Wired segment, which is our largest segment, but just if you look at our switching and routing sites, fair way to put it together, which is really data center networking business, we continue to see strength through the rest of the year. We see -- a big part of that strength we see is simply because of a very strong data center demand -- data center buildup by the cloud operators. We're seeing that now and I suspect that phenomenon will still continue, particularly when we start to ramp-up newer generation with high-bandwidth of Tomahawks and Tridents and as we go later part in the year of our DMX router and aggregation switches. So, we see that and this momentum to be fairly good based on demand -- intrinsic demand out there in data center expansion, especially into the cloud, but also from the fact that we're launching a few very key new products in this year. Blayne Curtis Thanks. Hock Tan Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Harlan Sur Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question and it's great to see the diversity in the business playing out here. On the strong growth in the storage business that I'm assuming some of this is your SSD product lines; I believe you guys are supplying Enterprise SSD controllers into the top two enterprising cloud SSD suppliers. And I think your top customer here just grew their Enterprise SSD business I think 20% sequentially and 20% year-over-year in the December quarter. Wondering if you guys are seeing similar growth trends? And do you expect double-digit growth in the SSD segment for the full year? Hock Tan I'll be [Indiscernible] our visibility in the SSDs are not as good as perhaps our customers are. A big part of it is there are three parts to our Enterprise Storage, three broad parts, one is very related to storage server connectivity, that's the rate part and the Fiber Channel whole part side of it rate. And then there is the components we ship into hard disk drives. And hard disk drive has experience as you well know a strong surge over the last several months probably because flash have been in short supply. And the last and smallest part of our business in Enterprise Storage is really related to Enterprise flash controllers for SSD. And that's really a small part. So, we don't get that broad visibility into this SSD market as a lot of other people would. But you're, right now, it's very, very strong and especially in SAS. Harlan Sur Great. Thanks for the insights there. And then off of the success of Tomahawks and I also hear that your prior generation Trident is still very strong as well and the team is ramping into this upgrade cycle, but you started sampling Tomahawk II, I think it was second half of last year. Can you just give us an update on the qualification, customer feedback, and when should we see the adoption curve for T2 starting to ramp, is that going to be kind of 2018 timeframe? Hock Tan For very competitive reasons I really hate to give you specifics here. Suffice to say it's very well received. We have a lot of momentum on our entire switch portfolio. And by the way as Tomahawk doesn't fully replace Trident, Trident is using a different segment versus Tomahawk and both are going very well as are the Jericho products, which are more aggregation switching and routing. So, broadly our portfolio of -- from high end down to even low range -- on the low-end range of switching -- campus switching pointers [ph], those are all going very well. And I suspect it's all largely due to the strength in data center spending that still receive continue, particularly more recently since we had very strong conversion of Enterprises into the cloud. Harlan Sur Thanks Hock. Operator Your next question comes from William Stein with SunTrust. William Stein Great. Thanks so much for taking my question and congrats on the very strong results and outlook. I wanted to address the free cash flow margin trajectory. Tom I think you referred to some of this in your prepared remarks, but I'd like you to maybe highlight what aside from the restructuring expenses that are still being paid and the temporarily higher CapEx that you are experiencing, what are the other drivers to get you to the 35% free cash flow margin? And what sort of timing should we think about for that? Tom Krause William good question and I think that's sort of the point of the prepared remarks. And if you look at where we are from an operating margin perspective, you look at the fact we restructured the balance sheet around now fixed rate debt. If you look at our sustainable tax rate of 4.5% and cash taxes of approximately $100 million a quarter and you take out the restructuring costs, which are bleeding off here pretty quickly, you take out the one-time campus initiative, the one-time tester initiative this year which will sort of play itself out over the next couple of quarters. Frankly, we're largely there. And that's probably the real takeaway and of course that doesn't take into account what we would expect to be the second half seasonally up trends from a revenue perspective. William Stein It's helpful. Appreciate it. Maybe one more. Something that came up last quarter was the change in capital allocation strategy. Maybe you can sort of highlight for us your plans on the M&A front from here despite the higher dividend -- the significantly higher free cash flow that you are going to be generating I guess after these temporary expenses falloff would seem to meet to continue to support a good M&A pipeline. Maybe you can characterize for us please? Tom Krause Yes, I mean there's no real uptick there other than we outlined very clearly that we're going to continue to drive given back 50% of free cash flows to investors in the form of dividends, which, of course, at these levels, would imply that we're going to have the ability to continue to increase the dividend pretty meaningfully here over the next couple of years certainly. Beyond that we've used M&A to drive returns, obviously, over the last several years pretty effectively. We continue to see opportunities to do that. Brocade is the latest example of being able to put capital work and an interesting opportunity that drives better returns than our alternative. So, we're going to continue to do that, but given our scale, we have the opportunity to do that mostly off the balance sheet, particularly with smallest opportunities that arise. William Stein Great. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Vinay Jaising Hello, this is Vinay Jaising calling in for Craig. Thanks for giving the opportunity to ask the question. So, I wanted touch upon carrier aggregation, like this is one of the key growth drivers for RF business. Hock, can you provide us an update on the trends you're seeing by geography for that? And what that means for your portfolio? Hock Tan Okay. Carrier aggregation as you well know is the phenomenon of especially benefiting operators who have multiple spectral bandwidth, not necessarily one but multiple, and interest of reducing CapEx infrastructure is the phenomenon of enabling those bandwidths to max together into one, which creates much more capacity throughput and that's not only in infrastructure, it goes into the phone. And we are probably one of the leading enablers in the phone of making that happen simply because not just of architectural design of the cellular RF analog, but also the fact that FBAR filters which are FBAR, are much better performing and more integral -- have been able to integrate it into a module to allow of that maxing and de-maxing separate spectral bands. And that's happening. It started very aggressively obviously in China continuing to be very much so in China. It's also happening very aggressively in the U.S. Those are the two biggest geographies where a lot of that is happening, started with downlink last year, I think, and it's now moving on to up-linking, not just downlinking, which, of course, then part of reason why it's helping create -- not the only reason, but one of the reasons creating increased content in a cellular RF demand. So, it's great for us and we see that phenomenon continuing to grow and expand into other regions of the world. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful. And for my follow-up, I want to touch upon gross margins. Pretty good performance in gross margin during the quarter and the guidance, but I was thinking about how should we think about gross margins for here? And if you can outline like what are the top two drivers of gross margin expansion as we look out towards rest of fiscal 2017? Hock Tan Okay. Well, it's a very interesting point and as we -- if you look back to a year ago when we just closed the Broadcom transaction every quarter since then, we have been able to expand our gross margin in the range of roughly 40, 50 basis points sequentially. A big part of it is as we settle down the portfolio, as we start to get the benefit of larger scale in purchasing materials and as very specific actions like taking -- basically bringing testing very much in-house and consigning testers to contract manufacturers instead of leasing test time for our huge volume of semiconductor chips. All those various actions -- a lot of a big part of this expansion of gross margin comes from a scale and ability to leverage on the scale in direct materials. It also helps that our product margin as we move from one generation to the other, keeps getting richer in terms of the mix. So, that's a combination of those two things. And in terms of where will it go from here? Frankly, I don't know. Best indicator is probably to look at history. Vinay Jaising Got it, that's helpful, and congrats once again on a good quarter. Hock Tan Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research. Stacy Rasgon Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. For my first one you've talked a lot about free cash flow margins, but I wanted to dig a little bit into the payout ratio. You are paying out right now about a little over 30%, target is 50%. Should we think about that sort of level going up to 50% in line with the margins going up to 35% or more? Or like how should we think about the trajectory of reaching your target on the payout ratio that seems like something that's more in your control maybe even quicker than the margins themselves? Tom Krause Well, they kind of go hand-in-hand Stacy. I think what we're going to do and so articulate in the past is we're going to get to the end of the fiscal year, we're going to look back at the free cash flow trajectory on those margins over the course of that previous year. We're going to look at the business; obviously, we're very focused on sustainability. And then we're going to pay out 50%. And so all you are seeing is the general trajectory improving from where we exited last year to where we are here exiting Q1 and guiding Q2. And you're right consistent with the policy as we get to the end of the year where we will achieve expectations that we're going to have -- obviously be in the position to raise that dividend consistent with getting back 50% on an LTM basis. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. For my follow-up I also wanted to dig into gross margins a little bit. You talked a little bit about the drivers, but I heard you say earlier that you're sort of comfortable with your level of OpEx spending as a percentage of revenue, which implies that the operating margin improvement toward the model from here comes from gross margins, but it's not that much, only about 150, maybe 200 basis points from where we are. And this is even before you buy Brocade, which comes in at gross margins in the 70s. so, given all the levers that you just talk about and Brocade coming in, why should 64%, 65%, which is where that would take you -- why should that be the upper limit? Like how should we think about this if we're going farther, I don't see any reason why shouldn't expect gross margins to go even higher than that unless there something else -- mix or something else that ought to be taking it down. Can you talk about that a little bit? Tom Krause Well, Stacy, it's -- actually I think we're going to get into the gross margin where we think we can go and if I go all the way back to the original Avago first margins in the 30s, obviously we're always focused on continuing to improve on our gross margin. I think the second part of the question is we are in our seasonally weak part of the year and so when you do look at the general seasonality of the business and where things are, I think you could take a whole fiscal year approach to looking at where operating margins will land and could land and apply that to how you're thinking about the model. That's the only guidance I'd give you. Stacy Rasgon Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from Vivek Arya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Vivek Arya Thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results and the consistent execution. For my first one, Hock, your Wired business has essentially been in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion range for the past year on a quarterly basis. Can you give us some puts and takes on what's done well, what's been different than expectations? Because my rate is that the switching parts has probably done fairly well with all the cloud opportunities, but your broadband access and set-top boxes has perhaps not done so well. But then on the prepared remarks you mentioned you are starting to see a little bit of a pick up on the broadband access side. So, just if you could give us a look back on what was different than expectations? And then as we look forward to this year, could we see contribution from both parts of Wired -- both the cable side as well as the switching side? Hock Tan That's a very interest -- good question actually, very insightful and let me try to explain it on our Wired business. You're right, it's our biggest segment and in simple terms broadly, there are two groups of products here and end markets. There's switching and routing, you correctly put out and that come from various fronts from standard switching and routing, as well ASICs, which is also part in there, as would be building block products as well as fiber optics components. That business is very Enterprise driven directly and has actually done very well even on a year-on-year -- especially on a year-on-year basis because it's growing as we move from 10-gigabit few years ago -- couple of years ago, to increasingly 25 and 100 coming out very fast. As that transition happens very fast, obviously it's driving and you always hear products like Trident going to Tomahawk, especially in the very high end and at Jericho. All these are related to data center switching and that's very, very -- that's driving growth on all infrastructure on a very stable basis, but driving growth very nicely close to high single-digits, even double-digits. Then the other part of the segment, which is pretty big too, is our broadband. And here the set-top box on the CP side and access gateways like DSL/PON on the infrastructure side. And here the business is stable; it's very stable, has been stable for the last couple -- few years and continues to be very stable and it's also very seasonal. And you will see that the later part of second half of the year is typically when it drives up and in the first half of the year is when it shows a seasonal decline. Hence in my opening remarks, I was mentioning that Q1 -- fiscal Q1 is probably a very seasonal low point and it gradually picks up seasonally later part of Q2, but certainly Q3, and then starts rolling over again, but if you look at it year-on-year, relatively very stable. So, we have a confluence of two segments mixed together in our Wired business which is what you're seeing. It dilutes basically the strength, the growth of switching and routing, but nonetheless, both are very franchise product, very franchise business and drives stability in this company. Vivek Arya Thanks Hock. And as my follow-up question, it's a somewhat longer term question. You're obviously doing quite well in the Wireless business and that can continue for some time. The cloud business is also doing quite well. But when I talk with a lot of your peers and ask them about growth in semis over the next three to five years, they talk about connected cars or Internet of Things, or machine learning, or 5G. Do you beer Broadcom is investing adequately to pursue those markets? Is there a part of the company that is looking at those longer term areas? Or do you think M&A is the better way to address some of those things as they become real over time? Thank you. Hock Tan Great question. Giving the opportunity to expand a little propaganda here, again, as we've already articulated. The franchise products we're in, the -- we are the technology; we are also the market leader in those areas. In those niches, some of them are very large niche, but we are the technology leader and we don't get there by not investing. We invested, as my remarks said and I said many times, very heavily in those areas we are in. We develop products that generally in those franchise areas before anybody else do it out there. And that's why we can sustain it, that's why our margins are the way it is because we provide products that allow our customers to differentiate and innovate themselves. So, we invest very heavily and you look at our total R&D, we invest in total $2.7 billion a year as a company in R&D. We're the best engineers out there; we have the best products in this area. So, that's really where we continue to sustain leadership in our existing franchise products. In some of those flights of fantasy somewhat that you covered earlier, we're not -- I'm not saying it won't happen. I will be direct, let somebody else take another hits and then we'll buy the company if it's successful. Thank you. Vivek Arya Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from [Indiscernible] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. I had one short-term question and then another longer term question. On the short-term question, with regards to Wireless, you talked about trends at you're Korean customer offsetting the seasonal trends at you're North American customer and therefore you are guiding Q2 to be down only high single-digits relative to history being down about 15%, I recall. Is the upside versus historical seasonality, is that all coming from dynamics at you're Korean customer or dynamics in terms of units or content at your North American customer trending better than history as well? Hock Tan You are really trying to pass the data, aren't you? It's all a combination really. It is -- and you obviously know out there it's also timing of some of the shipments and purchases by our two largest customers. So, there's a bunch of -- a few factors involved in here. One of which was there's timing this quarter differences in timing. There's the fact that you're right, Korean customer is coming in with a vengeance to try to recover share. And broadly, we're also talking about content increases as each new generation comes in and it's not even the Korean customer it's also the major North American customer. And it's a mix of all these factors. Have I sat down and broken it out in detail? No. We don't try to analyze it to that in degree, but those multiple factors mix pull together to basically indicate that the seasonality -- the downward seasonality that we saw a year ago is perhaps less pronounced this year. Unidentified Analyst Okay, great. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, another question on Wireless, specifically around China. Obviously, you're tied to the North American customer and the Korean customer in a big way today, but when you think about your Wireless business and your RF business specifically, on say a three-year view, how do you think about the opportunity in China today? Hock Tan Well, there are opportunities for us in China, and -- but the focus of our success and our product success in Wireless, especially content increases year-on-year is -- as you know, we push the cutting edge on technology. Be it wireless Wi-Fi connectivity or RF cellular, we push the envelope and that tends to go very much largely to the flagship class phones. That top of the pyramid where a big part of it has been our major North American customer and Korean customer, plus a few other guys spread around. That's where our strength is, that's where the demand and value seen our products can have. As China evolve over time, having said that, the opportunity exists, they will move from feature phones to low-end smartphones to now some premium phones. And we begin to get traction on even those premium phones to the extent that those brands in China use it, and that's why we need the technological engineering edge that we provide in the products. Until then, they need less of it. Except -- with exceptions like carrier aggregation when we obviously are the leader in providing solutions for carrier aggregation on a discrete basis. But on an integrated basis into smartphones, it's really the flagship phones and now increasingly premium phones making its way into flagship phones that we see the demand. And that transition is happening in China, albeit, on a very gradual basis, but we're very patient people, we'll wait for it. Unidentified Analyst Thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. John Pitzer Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me and congratulations. Hock, my first question is kind of a follow-up on the Enterprise Storage side. You rightfully pointed out that today, the SSD controller businesses is the smallest part of that business. I'm kind pf curious as you look out over time, do you see that market developing similar and potentially getting to be the size of the HDD controller market? Or is there something inherent about the growing complexity of raw NAND itself, which means there will always be a large portion of that controller market which is insourced, the guys building demand actually building their own controller. Do you think eventually you will end up in situation where it's all outsourced? Hock Tan That's a very insightful question and we see the SSD controllers for Enterprise to be a lot of it will be outsourced. Why? Because there are certain IP inherent in those Enterprise flash controllers that are very tricky to do. Not dissimilar from the re-channel of hard disk drives, so that will happen. [Indiscernible], because the nature of [Indiscernible], it's not so complex technology, IP required is not so extreme. We see that as probably less opportunistic for us, though one never knows. But certainly on Enterprise, which is where we are very focused on, we see a lot of need for intellectual property blocks features that few people can do. And we are one of those few people who can do it very well. John Pitzer That's helpful. And then, Hock, as my follow-up, I think a lot of us in the investment community understand the Wireless, both on the RF and on the connectivity side, the content ASP story. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that same dynamic in your Wired business. And maybe differentiate between switching and routing versus set-top box and broadband access? How do we think about the ASP trends in those two segments over time? Or just your content going into the CapEx dollars being spent in the Wired market? Hock Tan Well, if you talk about switching and routing, it's really more than just chips -- building blocks of chips. It's really as much an architectural play, especially in the high end top of the rack, in the [Indiscernible] and the spine side of the data centers. And here is where our model just goes beyond selling pieces of silicon; we sell a lot of firmware and software that goes hand in hand to enable those chips to work with multiple OEM customers at the end of the day. So, that's a very interesting model for us and what is overriding all of this is obviously the need for more larger and larger more and more throughput, especially, in data centers, and especially in top of the rack and all the way to the spine. So, we have big advantages in this area simply because of the strength of the intellectual property we have in making very complex engineering, very complex SoCs, but also interface very high-speed interfaces or [Indiscernible] as we call it. So, all that plays to our advantage of being able to do it. And we continue to do that, and we continue to -- it goes from 10-gigabit to 25 to 50 to 100 and maybe -- and going on in the future to 200-gigabit to 400-gigabit. We believe we are investing heavily to ensure that we can develop those kind of products and develop it first and better than anybody else. So, -- and with that expansion of features, we benefit from content increases, simply because you are providing a customer more throughput and it's not a one-on-one scaling, it's more and more -- it's a lot of value for our customers to be able to go from 25-gigabit -- or 10-gigabit to 100 in the next year or two and we provide a lot of value in that. And by the way, in broadband, it's not dissimilar. Except that maybe it's not evolving as rapidly simply because it's a much more stable market, for instance, you hear about now 4K TVs video delivery to moving on to high definition, HD, and eventually moving even to 8K. That would be interesting to see how 8K is going to be accepted since the human eye may not even notice the difference, but people want it. And they want that, we're able to provide that. But it might take a bit longer, that's why I said broadband to us is a much -- we look at it as a much more stable gradually evolving market, even as OTT, the hype behind OTT and all that comes play which we participate in. But in data centers, it's serious stuff. More and more data are being basically pushed through pipes stored, processed as social media keeps expanding. And that's why we are seeing this past quarter and current quarter extraordinary strength in the demand for switching and routing. John Pitzer That's great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.

I will now turn the call over to Baidu\'s CEO, Robin Li. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today\'s call. 2016 was a busy year, in which we experienced both significant breakthroughs and challenges as Baidu transitioned into the newest and most exciting stage of our journey so far. In 2016, we began to see glimpses of AI revolutionizing the Internet and traditional industries. The PC era and the rise of mobile over the past four or five years are in our rear view mirror. We are now living and breathing the era of artificial intelligence. We believe that AI is the new electricity, which will transform industry after industry, (3:18) new applications and products that we have yet to even imagine, and fundamentally, change how users interact with technology. AI represents an enormous opportunity and Baidu is primed to lead the AI revolution in China, as a result of years of investment and our position at the intersection of Big Data, technology and search, as well as our access to the best R&D talent in China and globally. To seize this opportunity, we have continuously shifted our strategy, organization, and resources to AI. And we continue to gain industry recognition. Just yesterday, MIT Technology Review singled out face recognition technology as one of the 2017\'s top 10 breakthrough technologies with Baidu as a key player. Launched last September, our artificial intelligence platform, Baidu Brain, is already deployed across nearly all of our products including Search, News Feed, Maps, Nuomi, and PostBar to name but a few. Users experience the magic of AI when they use Voice and Image Search or when we push targeted content in News Feed, recommend dishes in Nuomi, optimize a route in Maps, or intelligently (4:51) video content on PostBar. With AI, we are able to better match and predict user intent and deliver results that are more relevant and more targeted. By opening up Baidu Brain\'s APIs to the Chinese developer community, we are also leading the charge to transform traditional business into AI-enabled one. And our AI-driven initiative such as DuerOS supported by our leading Chinese language voice recognition technology opens up a new human-digital interaction paradigm. We\'ve announced a DuerOS powered TV assistant in collaboration with (5:37) and a DuerOS powered home robot named Little Fish (5:43). And we recently completed our acquisition of Raven Tech, a smartphone hardware start-up. We are excited to welcome Raven Tech\'s CEO, Jesse Lu, and the team to the Baidu family. Our AI technology is even showing signs of adapting humans. Last year, DeepSpeech, our voice recognition technology for Search, was just slightly better than human level voice-recognition accuracy at 82%. To-date, our technology has further widened the lead performing at 86% accuracy. In December, our AI capabilities were showcased on popular Chinese television show the Super Brain where our Xiaodu robot competed in three mind-bending voice and image recognition challenges against human geniuses. Xiaodu won two out of three challenges and tied for the third. Beyond our core platform, our leadership in AI creates vast opportunities in areas such as financial services, cloud and autonomous driving. We are investing in these opportunities for the long-term and have attracted some of the best talent to drive this effort to fruition. In 2016, we made tremendous effort to upgrade the Search user experience to ensure that users have confidence in the quality of content on our platform. To-date, we have largely completed the process of verifying ICP licenses and enterprise banking accounts for all of our customers. In the process of this cleanup effort, some portion of our customer base may not be able to meet our stringent requirements and we may experience a short-term reduction in the number of online active customers. The higher standard are healthy and good for our platform. And customers who comply with our stringent requirements may be able to enjoy a higher volume (8:02) and even more attractive ROI, and in turn, spend more of their budget on our platform, be it through Search, News Feed or our other AI-powered products. Our untapped customer pool also remains vast. With Search, News Feed, and other products serving both direct response and branded advertising to key accounts, small and medium enterprises, and local merchants. Our value proposition to customers is highly compelling. With hundreds of millions of user seeking and consuming content on Baidu platform, our content ecosystem is a key focus for investment and innovation. In particular, News Feed is a very exciting AI-powered product that have seen fast user adoption over the past several quarters. News Feed complement Search by bringing user\'s fresh, tailored content, creating a virtuous circle of content push and pull. Nearly half of Mobile Baidu version 7.3 and above users engage with News Feed on a daily basis and spend, on average, twice as much time in the app as compared to users who have yet to use News Feed. This strong traction is encouraging and we look forward to adding new app features and further improving our News Feed product. Another key part of our content ecosystem is our Baidu Brain powered open content platform (9:50) which we launched at the end of September. The (9:55) content distribution platform creates high-quality contents across media formats such as images, texts, videos, AR and VR, which Baidu host and operate within our ecosystem. Content creators are eager to be part of the (10:15) platform due to our vast user traffic and targeted matching of users to content. The platform has shown rapid growth with over 200,000 content creators registered. On the customer front, News Feed is showing early signs of being a natural incremental complement to Search. We are very encouraged by the momentum we\'ve gained so far with both users and customers. And we see strong potential for News Feed to help expand our customer pool and attract more large customers in verticals such as retail and auto, and more SME customers in verticals such as education and local services. Maps and Nuomi continue to support our Search ecosystem by providing reach, local services content. In the fourth quarter, Baidu Maps, Nuomi, and Local Express added breadth and depth to our points of interest database, bringing users direct access to over 2.4 million merchants as of the end of December, which is a 117% increase year-over- year. Now, looking to some of our longer term investment areas, we made progress in our autonomous driving initiative and demonstrated our technology at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen this past November. Over 200 attendees and journalists experienced Level-4 fully autonomous driving under real-world conditions in our fleet of 18 self-driving cars powered by Baidu AutoBrain, our AI platform for autonomous vehicles. Our teams in Beijing and the U.S. are making incredible progress on a daily basis with the accuracy of Baidu\'s vehicular recognition already above 90% and Baidu HD mapping exceeding 90% accuracy with (12:30) level precision. We launched our Baidu Cloud business in the second half of 2016 and have been making solid progress in building out our cloud product offering. With our AI, Big Data, and Cloud infrastructure at our core, we are able to provide our customers with a highly-differentiated value proposition. For example, Baidu helped the Taiyuan Railway Administration build up its intelligent logistics cloud platform by leveraging our cloud technologies and real-time Big Data algorithms to help optimize the customer storage, shipment, and drop plan. We\'ve also introduced advanced solutions such as logistics navigation, image recognition, and IoT offerings. Customer feedback for our Cloud service has been very positive and growth this year has been very encouraging. Our Financial Services business continues to transform the traditional financial services industry. Here, our AI strength is the crucial advantage for areas such as credit risk management and matching customers with the most appropriate product. Baidu Wallet, which serves as a user gateway to branch into other financial products expanded its reach with activated user accounts surpassing 100 million as of end of fourth quarter compared to 90 million as of the end of third quarter. With Baidu\'s innovative approach to Financial Services product, we are creating new supply and demand and processing new market all the while helping to support the growth of traditional industries such as education, travel, home decoration, and cosmetic surgery. In the education loans, we continue to dominate with roughly 75% market share. ITE performed very well in the quarter too with revenue and rapid subscriber numbers ramping up nicely. In December of 2016, according to iResearch, ITE\'s mobile app maintained its industry leadership with 125 million daily active users, 480 million monthly active users, 335 billion minutes monthly user time. ITE is an important part of Baidu content ecosystem, and we look forward to supporting its further growth. ITE has also recently completed the issuance of US$1.5 billion convertible notes of which Baidu invested US$300 million. Baidu Deliveries also grow rapidly, nearly doubling its GMV year-over-year. Baidu Deliveries\' differentiated go-to-market strategy of choosing select, attractive market combined with our technology driven AI-powered competitive advantage are helping to build a sustainable business for the long-term. As announced in our earnings press release earlier today, Mr. Greg Penner will step down from our board, having served as a board member since July 2004. On behalf of Baidu\'s board of directors, I would like to express my gratitude to Greg for his long-standing dedication and invaluable contribution to Baidu. And last but not least, on behalf of the entire Baidu team, I would like to welcome Dr. Qi Lu, our new Group President and Chief Operating Officer, who is joining our earnings call for the first time. Qi has been appointed as our new Director and Vice Chairman of our board of directors. As you know, Qi is one of the most experienced leaders in the global technology industry, and also a foremost expert in AI. Qi oversees our product, technology, sales, marketing and operations. I look forward to working closely with Qi to take Baidu\'s management and technology to the next level. Qi, do you have a few words to say? Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Thank you very much, Robin, and hello to everyone. It is a real honor to be joining my first Baidu earnings call as Group President and COO. As a leader in China\'s Internet industry for over a decade, Baidu has built up an incredibly strong set of reinforcing assets in terms of technology, data, talents and insights. This is a very exciting time, as China plus AI is an enormous opportunity for growth, which Baidu is very well-positioned to lead. We have a great journey ahead of us, and I have already been very energized by the amazing work that\'s going on here. I look forward to speaking with you more in the months ahead on many of the initiatives, especially in AI, that are underway. Back to you, Robin. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Qi. To conclude, AI represents a revolution in how humans and businesses interact with, and benefit from, technology. China plus AI will be a tremendous field of opportunity that Baidu is well-positioned to lead as a result of our long track record of investment and innovation. Looking ahead, we will continue to apply our expanding portfolio of AI-based technologies to an ever-widening range of applications, while we strengthen Baidu\'s role as an essential distributor of dynamic content on the Chinese Internet, from news and images to video, data and connected services. With that, I will now turn the call over to Jennifer for an update on financials. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Robin. Hello, everyone. 2016 was a challenging year and a busy year, with proactive implementation of stringent customer requirements and compliance with the new advertising law impacting our revenue. These efforts are necessary, and will help us build a better user experience and a healthier, more robust platform. We largely completed our cleanup initiative in the fourth quarter, and believe that the most significant revenue impact is behind us. Revenue in the fourth quarter resets our revenue base, and we look forward to 2017 as a time of gradual recovery and growth. Over the past year, we have carefully reviewed our strategy and business portfolio. As Robin mentioned, the mobile transition is behind us, and we\'re at the cusp of an AI revolution. Baidu\'s strategic focus, organization, and resources have shifted increasingly towards AI, and we are excited to execute our vision in this new era. Given the strategic shift to capture the opportunities in the new AI era, we do not believe metrics such as mobile search MAU, mobile maps MAU, GMV and Wallet user numbers are indicative of our business performance. As such, this will be the last quarter that we will report that set of operating metrics. We always seeks to be open and transparent, and we\'ll continue to update the investment community on the most important metrics to track our progress. In 2017, we\'ll continue to invest to build our content and service ecosystem and execute our plan to capture the AI opportunity in China. Content continues to be an important investment area, as we continue to support ITE\'s growth and build out (21:16), (21:17) content platform to attract content and service partners, Maps and Nuomi, and key relationships with partners such as Ctrip will support our service ecosystem. Now moving to the financials, all number amounts are in RMB unless stated otherwise. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were RMB 18.2 billion, representing a 2.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2015, and flat year-over-year, excluding Qunar in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total revenues for the full-year 2016 were RMB 70.5 billion, a increase of approximately 6.3% from 2015 and a 12% year-over-year increase ,excluding Qunar. During the fourth quarter, Baidu had approximately 552,000 active online marketing customers, a 18.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2015, and a 13.7% decrease from the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the fourth quarter was RMB 35,400, a 14.2% increase from the corresponding period in 2015, and a increase of 13.1% from the previous quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 was RMB 2.6 billion, or 14.5% of total revenues, compared to 14% in the corresponding period in 2015, and 14.2% in the third quarter of 2016. Full-year 2016 tax as a percent of revenue was 14.7%, up from 13.3% for 2015. Bandwidth and depreciation cost as a percent of revenue in Q4 were 6.8% and 4.5% respectively, compared to 5.4% and 3.7% in the corresponding period in 2015. In 2016, bandwidth and depreciation costs as a percent of revenue increased to 6.7% and 4.4% from 5.6% and 3.9% respectively in 2015. Operational cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 were RMB 1.2 billion, representing 6.5% of total revenues, compared to 6.3% in the corresponding period in 2015. Total operational cost for 2016 were RMB 4.4 billion, representing 6.3% of total revenues compared to 5.8% in 2015. Content cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q4 were RMB 2.6 billion, representing 14.1% of total revenues compared to 7.4% in the corresponding period in 2015. Total content costs for 2016 were RMB 7.9 billion, representing 11% of total revenue compared to 5.6% in 2015. This increase was mainly due to iQiyi\'s increased content cost. In 2017, we expect content cost to step up at a similar pace as 2016. Content cost will be used to invest in high quality, licensed and self-produced content to support ITE and support Search and News Feed products through our (24:59) platform. SG&A expenses in Q4 were RMB 3.3 billion, a decrease of 26.4% year-over-year, and a decrease of 22% excluding Qunar over the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease was mainly due to a decrease in promotional spending for Transaction Services. Total SG&A expenses for 2016 were RMB 15.1 billion, a 11.7% decrease from 2015 and a 5.6% year-over-year increase excluding Qunar. In 2017, SG&A will remain at a similar level to that of 2016, with spending shifting to Mobile Baidu and News Feed to further drive user adoption. R&D expenses in Q4 were RMB 3 billion, an increase of 19.5% over the corresponding period in 2015, and a year-over-year increase of 25%, excluding Qunar in the fourth quarter of 2015. Total R&D expenses for 2016 were RMB 10.2 billion, a 0.2% decrease from 2015 and 12.5% year over increase, excluding Qunar. In 2017, we\'ll continue to invest in R&D. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating costs and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB 632 million in Q4 from RMB 341 million in the corresponding period in 2015. SBC expenses for 2016 increased 27% over the 2015 level and increase 60% year-over-year, excluding Qunar. Operating profit for Q4 were RMB 2.2 billion, a decrease of 38.2% over Q4 2015, and a decrease of 40% after excluding Qunar impact in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating profit for the full-year 2016 decreased 14% from 2015 and 25% year-over-year, excluding Qunar. Other income net was RMB 1.8 billion in the fourth of 2016, which mainly consisted of the investment gain recognized as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Uber China shares with Didi. Other income net was RMB 24 billion in the corresponding period of 2015, which mainly consisted of the investment gain as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Qunar shares with Ctrip. For the full-year, other income net was RMB 3.8 billion in 2016 compared to RMB 24.7 billion in 2015. Income tax expense was RMB 401 million for the fourth quarter. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 8.9% compared to 12.7% in Q4 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the newly-granted preferential tax licenses for certain PRC subsidiaries. For the full-year, our effective tax rate was 20.1% compared to 14.4% in 2015. Excluding the share exchange transactions impact for the past two years, the effective tax rate was flat year-over-year. For 2017, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the mid to high teens. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q4 was RMB 4.1 billion. Basic and diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS for the fourth quarter amounted to RMB 11.43 and RMB 11.4, respectively. Diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS excluding net gain recognized as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Uber China shares with Didi for Q4 was RMB 6.49. Diluted earnings attributable to Baidu per ADS excluding net gain recognized as a result of Baidu\'s exchange of Qunar shares with Ctrip for the fourth quarter, last year 2105 was RMB 7.61. Net income attributable to Baidu for the full-year was RMB 11.6 billion. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q4 was RMB 4.6 billion. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q4 was RMB 13.23. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for the full-year was RMB 13.2 billion. As of Q4, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB 89.8 billion. Net operating cash inflow and capital expenditure for the fourth quarter were RMB 8 billion and RMB 1.2 billion respectively. Full-year net operating cash inflow and capital expenditures were RMB 22.3 billion and RMB 4.2 billion respectively. Total head count on a consolidated basis including invested entities as of December 31, 206 was about 45,900, a increase of 2.3% as compared to the end of last quarter. Now, let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the first quarter of 2017. We currently expect total revenue for the first quarter to be between RMB 16.48 billion to RMB 17.03 billion, representing a 4.2% to 7.6% year-over-year increase, or negative 9.5% to negative 6.5% quarter-over-quarter. Please note, this forecast reflects Baidu\'s current and preliminary view, and is subject to change. I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Merrill Lynch Far East Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, and many congratulations in bringing Qi to the team as well. I have a question on News Feed. I think Robin mentioned that so far, you have been seeing some complementary results between Search and News Feed. Could you share more color with us on how your marketing clients are looking at these two applications, how they are allocating their budgets between Search and News Feed? Should we also see a bit of cannibalizations to some clients as well? Thanks. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Eddie, this is Robin. I think, when we see that News Feed is complementary to Search and will bring incremental traffic and revenue to Baidu, it really means that many of our marketing clients, especially when I mentioned large clients in the industry of auto and real estate, they were not able to find enough number of (33:14) traffic to show their ads in the Search context, but it\'s much easier for them to find targeted users in the News Feed context. And similarly, for providers of local services or education services that got a local focus, it\'s again easier to use News Feed to target their customers instead of using Search. So, our customers or advertisers can actually find more qualified traffic on the Baidu platform. Currently, we have seen very good adoption rate, many of the clients, marketing clients, are already coming up with specialty created creatives for the News Feed context, which is a very encouraging sign (34:25) like our News Feed product. And as I mentioned many times before, I think our business is very much traffic bound, not budget bound. So, the more traffic we can provide to our advertisers, they will have a more budget matching with us (34:49). Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. (Broker) Good morning, good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. I also want to congratulate you on hiring Dr. Qi Lu, as well as ending 2016 and putting it behind us. I was wondering – I wanted to ask you a little bit about strategy and also about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the strategic imperatives you may put in place over the next few years, and what that game plan might be? And relatedly, I\'m wondering if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of O2O? And then on core search, you\'re guiding to about 6% revenue growth in the first quarter. I\'m wondering what that might indicate for Search revenue? And also, if you can give us some color on just the pace of the recovery of the core Search business this year, that would be very helpful. Thank you very much. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Chi, I\'ll give you a big picture on the core business and new opportunities, and I\'ll let Jennifer address the Q1 growth guidance. I think we have entered the era of artificial intelligence, and fortunately, we invested in this area for the past five to six years. Actually, both the existing, the core business of Baidu and the new opportunities we are addressing, are powered by AI today, especially for Search. Five, ten years ago, when you think about search technology, it was very different. It\'s basically statistics-based technology. Today, search is almost all about machine learning, natural language understanding. So it\'s all about search. And the people will be able to express their interest or queries in a much more natural way. And we support voice as well as image as queries, and we\'re seeing increasing number of people using this kind of new form of queries to find what they need. These are all AI-based technologies. And News Feed again is also pretty much an AI, essentially it\'s the technology that matches user interest with relevant content. So we find we can leverage our strengths in AI technology to come up with much better products for our users. O2O, again, we reduced the sub fees as well as marketing cost for Nuomi and Baidu Deliveries. But we think this is an integral part of our core business. People come to Baidu Search for all kinds of things, including information, content and services, and Nuomi provides the perfect content for services. And we are fine-tuning the Nuomi content as well as services, and make them more friendly to the Mobile Baidu users, and make more opportunities for Nuomi merchants to show up in the Mobile Baidu platform. So going forward, we think we will be able to see solid growth in both our core products, which now includes Search, News Feed, O2O, and also new initiatives in terms of cloud, financial services, autonomous driving, and a few other AI-related new initiatives. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Chi, as you recall, last year was a busy year. Lots of the activity, particularly in related to addressing the customer base happened in the middle of the second quarter. So as we look at 2017, I think thinking about 2016 was a – not a very normal year, maybe looking and thinking about the revenues pattern from a sequential quarter-over-quarter perspective would be more meaningful. And that – I think it\'s more perhaps an easier way to think about the revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 largely resets our revenue base particularly for Search business. Much of the cleanup activities, the higher requirement for our customers are put in place. And the revenue impact that – as a result is largely behind us. So as we are going into Q1 and for the rest of the year, I think, the Search – we have been carrying out this business for years and it does have its quarterly pattern. And thinking it in that way as a normal pattern, maybe that\'s a helpful way to think about the business this year. And this year, as we are looking towards gradually recovering and we\'ll drive growth in the Search business, of course, other than the Search, we have the Feed product that is complementary to the core Search business. So that\'s perhaps, is helpful as you think about the 2017 revenue growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Thank you very much. And, yeah, I just want to join the chorus to congratulations of the (41:05) senior management changes. Just with regard to ITE, if I\'m not mistaken, we talked about a 110% growth in content cost last year. And I believe Jennifer said we should expect a similar degree of growth, and I assume that\'s a percentage statement. And if so, would that suggest that there is a further expansion in loss margin or are there things going on in revenues that would somehow lessen that negative contribution. And then, secondly, I\'m just curious, how would we view the margin profile of News Feed versus core Search both in these early days, and then where would they be on a steady state basis. I assume you have content-related expenses associated with procuring news flow. So just curious how those two margins might compare. Thank you very much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Alan. Yes, as I indicated earlier, content investment will continue to be a important investment area for us going into 2017. For ITE, over the past two years, we have invested strategically and very successfully in ITE\'s content. And as you can see, ITE\'s subscription user base is growing and that nicely complements its advertising revenue business model. So I think going into 2017, we\'ll continue to execute on that strategy. ITE has demonstrated, over the years, a high core competency in quality content selection. And going into 2017, more of the efforts will be spent in self-produced content, and that will help further strengthen and expand our subscription user base. From a margin perspective for ITE, over the past two years, their margin is actually improving, and we expect that it will be the trend going forward. So ITE is on a solid path, and I think the investment is very warranted, and they have demonstrated good returns for those kind of content investment. Included in 2017 content, as you mentioned, you\'ve correctly pointed out, that we also invest in content for our Feed business. The Feed business product from a margin profile perspective is different from Search. Related at this early stage part of the investment for Feed is content related and also we will be aggressive in rolling out user adoptions, mechanisms for Feed to be more penetrated into the user base. So early stage monetization maybe ramping up, but at the same time, we\'re investing in distribution channels in sales and marketing as well as content for Feed. Over time, as we mentioned earlier, this is also a integral part of our Search service and that offers a bigger product selections for our advertiser customers, and also very importantly, offers more ad inventory if our users adoption is good. So early stage for Feed, but it does carry a slightly different margin profile, but overall, it\'s a complementary and enhancive to our Search service. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, and Qi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my questions also related to News Feed. Wanted to get a sense, does the 1Q guidance that you provided include any expectations from the News Feed ad contributions? And what is management expectation and target regarding how fast and how big the News Feed could achieve in 2017? And also given your comment on shifting to AI and all this content platform, and Jennifer you just mentioned about some spending. Just roughly, could you get a sense of how much the investment spend that we should expect related to this News Feed ads initiative? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Alicia, thank you for the question. For Q1, specifically, there is a – News Feed is a product that we launched for a few quarters now and early stage in monetization. So, for Q1 guidance, we do have a small part that is contributing from Feed. It will roll over the years over the quarters into 2017 as we\'re growing the user base, users time on it, the advertiser pool, and we expect News Feed to add more contributions to our overall revenue contribution. For investment related to News Feed, I mentioned earlier, content is one specifically related to building out the ecosystem and provide a rich content and good user experience as our users use the product and engage with our service. For News Feed investment, I also mentioned about sales and marketing related expenses. So, this is more for user adoption. The investment in AI particularly are more in the technology side and that has to do mainly with R&D expenses. And therefore, as I mentioned earlier, we\'ll continue to invest in R&D steadily and – that is more gradual, its competency build up, its talent, so – but that\'s not different from the way that we have been approaching R&D investment over the years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the core Search business. The mobile search MAU this quarter, the growth rates slow down to 2% on a year-over-year basis. As you guys mentioned in the past that Search is a traffic-bound business, now that the mobile search traffic is slowing down and PC most likely is declining, how should we think about Search growth outlook for the next two to three years? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think the MAU for mobile search have to slow down because we basically penetrated almost all the Internet users here in China. And Internet penetration rate when that\'s (48:22) more than 50% growth rate will inevitably slow down. What we\'re hoping is that we will continue to innovate in search technology to enable people to ask questions or – and have queries in more natural ways, such as asking questions in natural language or in the form of voice or when they take a picture, they can use that picture to search. This will increase the dependency of users to our product. So I think, overall, the traffic growth for mobile will slow down, but we think it should be able to continue to grow over the next two to three years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Qi Lu, and Linda. Thank you my questions. Actually I have one follow-up question on News Feed, I am wondering if you could share with us some metrics in terms of News Feed advertising? What is the current pricing policy fixed rate (49:46)? And what is our strategy to compete for user time spend with our News Feed product particularly in terms of user experience when competing against market leader? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, I think we allow users to create designated creative work for News Feed advertisement. Therefore, the advertisers have the power to name their own price. If they don\'t do that, I mean, when they show the same creative for both Search and News Feed, we will typically apply a smart discount to the cost-per-click on the News Feed. So, on average, the click price for News Feed is meaningfully lower than that of Search. We are thinking about probably half of the Search related click price. Right now the ad load on our News Feed is relatively low and user experience has been very good with our Search-related customers at those creative dedicated for News Feed. Operator All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. Jennifer, you talked about MAU and GMV being less relevant for gauging success of business. What would be the relevant metrics you\'d look at going forward? And could you give us a sense of which ones are the ones that you would share with us going forward? And a question for Robin, Robin you made them push into software and hardware AI applications including the acquisition of Raven Technology and the establishment of few business units. How do you see this evolve, and could we talk about the shape and size of this opportunity? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes, with regards to the operating metrics as we mentioned earlier, the mobile transition is pretty much behind us. And our services are very much penetrated into the current Internet population in China. And also related to Nuomi services, it helps provide a service related content for our Search ecosystem and GMV won\'t be a meaningful target or objective for us. And so, we will always seek to be transparent and open with our business performance and provide relevant indicative metrics to give you insights into our business. We will – as we develop and focus on the ecosystem for Search, the service of the Feed product, information such as you know what we commented on how many parties are registered with (53:43) that helped build our content ecosystem. We talked about how much of our Mobile Baidu users are using the Feed products and we might share more insights as our product is tracking and giving us – giving the indicative insights into the business. So with meaningful metrics that we feel is reflective of our business, we will be very open and transparent about that, as we have always been doing so. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, on the hardware-software integration, I think this is one of the most important characteristic of AI era. With this kind integration, lot of innovations become possible, and the user experience is significantly improved based on that. That\'s why we are investing in both hardware and software for AI-related technologies. That its true for the mobile platform, but it\'s also true for the home environment as well as auto environment. For example, when you\'re at home, we mentioned we have collaborated with (55:15) when you\'re watching a TV show, you can instantly ask "who is that actor" in natural language will be able to find the answer for you. And in car environment, we have CoDriver, we have CarLife, which integrate a lot of Internet and AI voice-based command in those environment. That\'s just a couple of examples, when you integrate software with hardware, what could be possible going forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions. So I\'ve got question regarding your Transaction and related service. I think that the GMV declined sequentially by RMB 1.3 billion, but you also mentioned that your Transaction Service reduced operating margin by 21.8% versus 23.8% last quarter. So, just wondering, why is it that the related losses expanded while GMV scale contracted? And also, what\'s the management guidance for the margin for this year? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. For Q4, I think the margin impact from Transaction Services is also have to do with the overall base business. As you recall, our Search service – our service is sequentially a slight decrease. Normally in Q4 we would have increased, but because of all the activities going on, we didn\'t grow our revenue in Q4 per se. So I think that sets the base, and the component for Transaction Services, even if it stays similar with our continued investment in R&D and all that, that would translate into a bigger impact. At the same time, just looking at the Transaction Services, within it, we have reduced the spending for Nuomi-related promotional expenses. But at the same time, we see good traction on the Takeout Delivery service, that continues to do well. And also included in Transaction Service is Financial Services, and we\'re growing that business very nicely too. And so, I think our strategy is quite clear, and components of the Transaction Services, different elements are performing differently. And I think, as we go into 2017, it is quite clear. I think it\'s not the whole package that you\'re focused on GMV and Nuomi can help Search ecosystem on the service content side, and both Takeout Delivery service and FSG, Financial Services, can also take advantage of the AI technology and enable business growth, and also good user experience. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Dr. Lu, Jennifer, and thanks for taking my question. The question is regarding our paid subscription business on ITE. So you\'ve been actually sharing with the – some updated paid subscribers numbers, I remember by 2Q last year, we have reached the target of roughly 20 million, which is the leader across the sectors. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that. And also, regarding the comments about the cost structure possibility for ITE, I think – are we looking into the possibility that ITE can be close to breakeven in the next year or two? And also, a quick follow-up on the content spend guidance comments you have just now regarding the similar level of increase, is it related to the – referring to the percentage terms increase year-over-year, or about absolute amount of incremental cost run rate hike? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. On the ITE membership question, number of subscribers continue to grow at a very rapid rate. And we believe we are solidly number one in terms of subscription revenue, and will continue to go very fast. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think, on your other comment, specifically for content cost for 2017, what we were trying to provide you some color is, it will increase at the same rate, very similar rate compared to last year. So over the past two years, steadily, content cost have been following similar increase in investment levels. ITE, as we mentioned, ITE is doing well in its business, both on the user front as well as revenue front, and we are the market leader. So, I think the business has demonstrated a two-engine – two-powered engine revenue source. And I think in near term, we\'ll continue to invest in content and differentiate ITE as a service, and it\'s tracking very well. Operator Thank you. Our next question from the line of Ella Ji from China Renaissance. Please go ahead. Ella Ji - China Renaissance Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question for Dr. Lu Qi. So I just wonder after you have joined the company for several weeks, what do you think would be your to do list for 2017. Is there any specific strategy that you can share with us? And then, as an ordinary user as we use Baidu product, what should we expect to see differently going forward? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. First of all, thank you very much for your question. It seems I\'ve been here only for few weeks. I would say, I\'ve been able to spend lot of time with Robin thinking about our overall company\'s long-term strategy, particularly in the context of AI and China. And the focus is to land the opportunity in concrete user experience and concrete economic opportunities. And that will take some time to unfold and evolve, as I mentioned a little bit earlier. I look forward to the opportunity of – in coming months speaking to many of you about those ongoing initiatives. And I have full confidence over time, they will generate real user values and economic opportunities for company. And that\'s perhaps what I\'m able to say at the time for now, but I do very much appreciate your question. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Huang from Macquarie. Please go ahead. Wendy Huang - Macquarie Capital Ltd. Thank you. So, I have three housekeeping questions. The first, can you give us update about the Search revenue breakdown between the mobile and PC? And also how has the pricing gap between the two actually evolved over time in terms of CPM? And secondly, the number of advertisers seem to be the lowest point in the past 10 quarters. I assume that was partly due to the seasonality, partly due to the lingering impact from the medical adscene advertising law. So, going forward, how should we expect the number of advertisers to churn in Q1, and when should we expect the advertiser base to normalize? Lastly on the ITE, you recently did a CD, but I notice Baidu only contributed US$300 million out of US$1.5 billion. So, previously, Baidu hold about 80% in ITE, so what would be the Baidu holding after this? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, Wendy, I think we reported on the mobile revenue contribution for our total revenue. So, for the fourth quarter, it stands at 65% and continue to grow. And obviously, we\'re living in the mobile age and it\'s undoubtedly, mobile is contributing more and we do see monetization power on the mobile front growing at a much faster pace compared to PC, and it\'s close to be – we expect that to exceed PC\'s monetization capability, not very soon. On the customer front, yes, I mean, I think you understand last year we went through the whole review of our customer base, have much higher and stringent requirements for our customers. And for particularly, the ICT license and the bank account validation for enterprises, basically we block out individuals who do business, search engine marketing business on our platforms. So having raised the bar is no doubt that some of the customers may not meet that requirement. But we know it\'s good for our user experience, it\'s good for the business long-term, and that\'s what we\'d do. At the same time, we know the addressable market for the customers that we can service is vast and we are innovative on the product side. So not only Search with Feed products, there is much more inventories for advertisers and that can serve both brand players as well as the smaller players. So we expect our customer pool to be able to grow. We will continue to have the high requirement for our customers and gradually build up our customer base, assuring that we have high quality advertisers with us. For ITE, yes, Baidu will continue to strongly support ITE, and ITE is a very important content provider for our Search ecosystem. With this transaction, Baidu continues to have a majority ownership of ITE. Operator All right. Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Thomas Chong from BOCI. Please go ahead. Thomas Chong - BOCI Research Ltd. Hi, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, thanks for taking my questions. I have got quick question about the (1:07:43) headcounts in 2017. Given that we are investing in R&D, and in particular, in AI, are we going to hire a lot more talent in China or from overseas. And Jennifer, can you give us some color about the headcounts trend on a overall basis in 2017? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes. We have steadily invested in talent and R&D capabilities is really a key differentiating and competitive advantage Baidu has over the years. And we have steadily investing in R&D talent. As I mentioned earlier, particularly in the AI age, with many of the AI-enabled services that we are working on, we will continue to invest in R&D. But I think from a overall head count perspective, if you look at last year, the head count overall has not materially changed. Obviously, with more mature business, we look to the business to produce (1:08:58) more efficiently and therefore getting more efficiency and productivity out of existing business. But at the same time redirect resources to invest in new areas. So, overall, I think our R&D expenses will be a bigger component of the overall head count and that is how we deploy and allocate the human capital. So, I think 2017 we should expect R&D trending in normal patterns compared to a lot before as we invest in AI, but at the same time, the company is approaching a workforce planning with the disciplined approach and getting productivity out of the whole way we approach business.

Our first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Merrill Lynch Far East Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions, and many congratulations in bringing Qi to the team as well. I have a question on News Feed. I think Robin mentioned that so far, you have been seeing some complementary results between Search and News Feed. Could you share more color with us on how your marketing clients are looking at these two applications, how they are allocating their budgets between Search and News Feed? Should we also see a bit of cannibalizations to some clients as well? Thanks. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Eddie, this is Robin. I think, when we see that News Feed is complementary to Search and will bring incremental traffic and revenue to Baidu, it really means that many of our marketing clients, especially when I mentioned large clients in the industry of auto and real estate, they were not able to find enough number of (33:14) traffic to show their ads in the Search context, but it\'s much easier for them to find targeted users in the News Feed context. And similarly, for providers of local services or education services that got a local focus, it\'s again easier to use News Feed to target their customers instead of using Search. So, our customers or advertisers can actually find more qualified traffic on the Baidu platform. Currently, we have seen very good adoption rate, many of the clients, marketing clients, are already coming up with specialty created creatives for the News Feed context, which is a very encouraging sign (34:25) like our News Feed product. And as I mentioned many times before, I think our business is very much traffic bound, not budget bound. So, the more traffic we can provide to our advertisers, they will have a more budget matching with us (34:49). Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. (Broker) Good morning, good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. I also want to congratulate you on hiring Dr. Qi Lu, as well as ending 2016 and putting it behind us. I was wondering – I wanted to ask you a little bit about strategy and also about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on some of the strategic imperatives you may put in place over the next few years, and what that game plan might be? And relatedly, I\'m wondering if you can give us your current thinking on the importance of O2O? And then on core search, you\'re guiding to about 6% revenue growth in the first quarter. I\'m wondering what that might indicate for Search revenue? And also, if you can give us some color on just the pace of the recovery of the core Search business this year, that would be very helpful. Thank you very much. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Chi, I\'ll give you a big picture on the core business and new opportunities, and I\'ll let Jennifer address the Q1 growth guidance. I think we have entered the era of artificial intelligence, and fortunately, we invested in this area for the past five to six years. Actually, both the existing, the core business of Baidu and the new opportunities we are addressing, are powered by AI today, especially for Search. Five, ten years ago, when you think about search technology, it was very different. It\'s basically statistics-based technology. Today, search is almost all about machine learning, natural language understanding. So it\'s all about search. And the people will be able to express their interest or queries in a much more natural way. And we support voice as well as image as queries, and we\'re seeing increasing number of people using this kind of new form of queries to find what they need. These are all AI-based technologies. And News Feed again is also pretty much an AI, essentially it\'s the technology that matches user interest with relevant content. So we find we can leverage our strengths in AI technology to come up with much better products for our users. O2O, again, we reduced the sub fees as well as marketing cost for Nuomi and Baidu Deliveries. But we think this is an integral part of our core business. People come to Baidu Search for all kinds of things, including information, content and services, and Nuomi provides the perfect content for services. And we are fine-tuning the Nuomi content as well as services, and make them more friendly to the Mobile Baidu users, and make more opportunities for Nuomi merchants to show up in the Mobile Baidu platform. So going forward, we think we will be able to see solid growth in both our core products, which now includes Search, News Feed, O2O, and also new initiatives in terms of cloud, financial services, autonomous driving, and a few other AI-related new initiatives. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Chi, as you recall, last year was a busy year. Lots of the activity, particularly in related to addressing the customer base happened in the middle of the second quarter. So as we look at 2017, I think thinking about 2016 was a – not a very normal year, maybe looking and thinking about the revenues pattern from a sequential quarter-over-quarter perspective would be more meaningful. And that – I think it\'s more perhaps an easier way to think about the revenue growth. As I mentioned earlier, Q4 largely resets our revenue base particularly for Search business. Much of the cleanup activities, the higher requirement for our customers are put in place. And the revenue impact that – as a result is largely behind us. So as we are going into Q1 and for the rest of the year, I think, the Search – we have been carrying out this business for years and it does have its quarterly pattern. And thinking it in that way as a normal pattern, maybe that\'s a helpful way to think about the business this year. And this year, as we are looking towards gradually recovering and we\'ll drive growth in the Search business, of course, other than the Search, we have the Feed product that is complementary to the core Search business. So that\'s perhaps, is helpful as you think about the 2017 revenue growth. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Thank you very much. And, yeah, I just want to join the chorus to congratulations of the (41:05) senior management changes. Just with regard to ITE, if I\'m not mistaken, we talked about a 110% growth in content cost last year. And I believe Jennifer said we should expect a similar degree of growth, and I assume that\'s a percentage statement. And if so, would that suggest that there is a further expansion in loss margin or are there things going on in revenues that would somehow lessen that negative contribution. And then, secondly, I\'m just curious, how would we view the margin profile of News Feed versus core Search both in these early days, and then where would they be on a steady state basis. I assume you have content-related expenses associated with procuring news flow. So just curious how those two margins might compare. Thank you very much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Alan. Yes, as I indicated earlier, content investment will continue to be a important investment area for us going into 2017. For ITE, over the past two years, we have invested strategically and very successfully in ITE\'s content. And as you can see, ITE\'s subscription user base is growing and that nicely complements its advertising revenue business model. So I think going into 2017, we\'ll continue to execute on that strategy. ITE has demonstrated, over the years, a high core competency in quality content selection. And going into 2017, more of the efforts will be spent in self-produced content, and that will help further strengthen and expand our subscription user base. From a margin perspective for ITE, over the past two years, their margin is actually improving, and we expect that it will be the trend going forward. So ITE is on a solid path, and I think the investment is very warranted, and they have demonstrated good returns for those kind of content investment. Included in 2017 content, as you mentioned, you\'ve correctly pointed out, that we also invest in content for our Feed business. The Feed business product from a margin profile perspective is different from Search. Related at this early stage part of the investment for Feed is content related and also we will be aggressive in rolling out user adoptions, mechanisms for Feed to be more penetrated into the user base. So early stage monetization maybe ramping up, but at the same time, we\'re investing in distribution channels in sales and marketing as well as content for Feed. Over time, as we mentioned earlier, this is also a integral part of our Search service and that offers a bigger product selections for our advertiser customers, and also very importantly, offers more ad inventory if our users adoption is good. So early stage for Feed, but it does carry a slightly different margin profile, but overall, it\'s a complementary and enhancive to our Search service. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Global Markets Asia Ltd. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, and Qi. Thanks for taking my questions. So my questions also related to News Feed. Wanted to get a sense, does the 1Q guidance that you provided include any expectations from the News Feed ad contributions? And what is management expectation and target regarding how fast and how big the News Feed could achieve in 2017? And also given your comment on shifting to AI and all this content platform, and Jennifer you just mentioned about some spending. Just roughly, could you get a sense of how much the investment spend that we should expect related to this News Feed ads initiative? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Alicia, thank you for the question. For Q1, specifically, there is a – News Feed is a product that we launched for a few quarters now and early stage in monetization. So, for Q1 guidance, we do have a small part that is contributing from Feed. It will roll over the years over the quarters into 2017 as we\'re growing the user base, users time on it, the advertiser pool, and we expect News Feed to add more contributions to our overall revenue contribution. For investment related to News Feed, I mentioned earlier, content is one specifically related to building out the ecosystem and provide a rich content and good user experience as our users use the product and engage with our service. For News Feed investment, I also mentioned about sales and marketing related expenses. So, this is more for user adoption. The investment in AI particularly are more in the technology side and that has to do mainly with R&D expenses. And therefore, as I mentioned earlier, we\'ll continue to invest in R&D steadily and – that is more gradual, its competency build up, its talent, so – but that\'s not different from the way that we have been approaching R&D investment over the years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi, good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. I have a question on the core Search business. The mobile search MAU this quarter, the growth rates slow down to 2% on a year-over-year basis. As you guys mentioned in the past that Search is a traffic-bound business, now that the mobile search traffic is slowing down and PC most likely is declining, how should we think about Search growth outlook for the next two to three years? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think the MAU for mobile search have to slow down because we basically penetrated almost all the Internet users here in China. And Internet penetration rate when that\'s (48:22) more than 50% growth rate will inevitably slow down. What we\'re hoping is that we will continue to innovate in search technology to enable people to ask questions or – and have queries in more natural ways, such as asking questions in natural language or in the form of voice or when they take a picture, they can use that picture to search. This will increase the dependency of users to our product. So I think, overall, the traffic growth for mobile will slow down, but we think it should be able to continue to grow over the next two to three years. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Qi Lu, and Linda. Thank you my questions. Actually I have one follow-up question on News Feed, I am wondering if you could share with us some metrics in terms of News Feed advertising? What is the current pricing policy fixed rate (49:46)? And what is our strategy to compete for user time spend with our News Feed product particularly in terms of user experience when competing against market leader? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, I think we allow users to create designated creative work for News Feed advertisement. Therefore, the advertisers have the power to name their own price. If they don\'t do that, I mean, when they show the same creative for both Search and News Feed, we will typically apply a smart discount to the cost-per-click on the News Feed. So, on average, the click price for News Feed is meaningfully lower than that of Search. We are thinking about probably half of the Search related click price. Right now the ad load on our News Feed is relatively low and user experience has been very good with our Search-related customers at those creative dedicated for News Feed. Operator All right. Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. Jennifer, you talked about MAU and GMV being less relevant for gauging success of business. What would be the relevant metrics you\'d look at going forward? And could you give us a sense of which ones are the ones that you would share with us going forward? And a question for Robin, Robin you made them push into software and hardware AI applications including the acquisition of Raven Technology and the establishment of few business units. How do you see this evolve, and could we talk about the shape and size of this opportunity? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes, with regards to the operating metrics as we mentioned earlier, the mobile transition is pretty much behind us. And our services are very much penetrated into the current Internet population in China. And also related to Nuomi services, it helps provide a service related content for our Search ecosystem and GMV won\'t be a meaningful target or objective for us. And so, we will always seek to be transparent and open with our business performance and provide relevant indicative metrics to give you insights into our business. We will – as we develop and focus on the ecosystem for Search, the service of the Feed product, information such as you know what we commented on how many parties are registered with (53:43) that helped build our content ecosystem. We talked about how much of our Mobile Baidu users are using the Feed products and we might share more insights as our product is tracking and giving us – giving the indicative insights into the business. So with meaningful metrics that we feel is reflective of our business, we will be very open and transparent about that, as we have always been doing so. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah, on the hardware-software integration, I think this is one of the most important characteristic of AI era. With this kind integration, lot of innovations become possible, and the user experience is significantly improved based on that. That\'s why we are investing in both hardware and software for AI-related technologies. That its true for the mobile platform, but it\'s also true for the home environment as well as auto environment. For example, when you\'re at home, we mentioned we have collaborated with (55:15) when you\'re watching a TV show, you can instantly ask "who is that actor" in natural language will be able to find the answer for you. And in car environment, we have CoDriver, we have CarLife, which integrate a lot of Internet and AI voice-based command in those environment. That\'s just a couple of examples, when you integrate software with hardware, what could be possible going forward. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi, good morning, management. Thanks for taking my questions. So I\'ve got question regarding your Transaction and related service. I think that the GMV declined sequentially by RMB 1.3 billion, but you also mentioned that your Transaction Service reduced operating margin by 21.8% versus 23.8% last quarter. So, just wondering, why is it that the related losses expanded while GMV scale contracted? And also, what\'s the management guidance for the margin for this year? Any color would be helpful. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. For Q4, I think the margin impact from Transaction Services is also have to do with the overall base business. As you recall, our Search service – our service is sequentially a slight decrease. Normally in Q4 we would have increased, but because of all the activities going on, we didn\'t grow our revenue in Q4 per se. So I think that sets the base, and the component for Transaction Services, even if it stays similar with our continued investment in R&D and all that, that would translate into a bigger impact. At the same time, just looking at the Transaction Services, within it, we have reduced the spending for Nuomi-related promotional expenses. But at the same time, we see good traction on the Takeout Delivery service, that continues to do well. And also included in Transaction Service is Financial Services, and we\'re growing that business very nicely too. And so, I think our strategy is quite clear, and components of the Transaction Services, different elements are performing differently. And I think, as we go into 2017, it is quite clear. I think it\'s not the whole package that you\'re focused on GMV and Nuomi can help Search ecosystem on the service content side, and both Takeout Delivery service and FSG, Financial Services, can also take advantage of the AI technology and enable business growth, and also good user experience. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Dr. Lu, Jennifer, and thanks for taking my question. The question is regarding our paid subscription business on ITE. So you\'ve been actually sharing with the – some updated paid subscribers numbers, I remember by 2Q last year, we have reached the target of roughly 20 million, which is the leader across the sectors. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that. And also, regarding the comments about the cost structure possibility for ITE, I think – are we looking into the possibility that ITE can be close to breakeven in the next year or two? And also, a quick follow-up on the content spend guidance comments you have just now regarding the similar level of increase, is it related to the – referring to the percentage terms increase year-over-year, or about absolute amount of incremental cost run rate hike? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. On the ITE membership question, number of subscribers continue to grow at a very rapid rate. And we believe we are solidly number one in terms of subscription revenue, and will continue to go very fast. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. I think, on your other comment, specifically for content cost for 2017, what we were trying to provide you some color is, it will increase at the same rate, very similar rate compared to last year. So over the past two years, steadily, content cost have been following similar increase in investment levels.

So, I think the business has demonstrated a two-engine – two-powered engine revenue source.

Given that we are investing in R&D, and in particular, in AI, are we going to hire a lot more talent in China or from overseas. And Jennifer, can you give us some color about the headcounts trend on a overall basis in 2017? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yes.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. In addition, a webcast of this conference call will also be available on Baidu's IR website. I will now turn the call over to Baidu's CEO, Robin Li. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Hello, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Earlier today, we announced that Jennifer will become CEO of Baidu Capital, an investment firm. Jennifer will transition away from her responsibilities as CFO, following the appointment of her successor. Jennifer has played an instrumental role in Baidu's growth over the nine years she has been our CFO. And as CEO of Baidu Capital, she will continue to be part of the Baidu family and contribute to building Baidu's ecosystem, which is crucial in bringing AI to real world applications. Jennifer's extensive experience in the area of finance, capital markets, technology, auto, financial services, and consumer industries will help bridge technology as well as traditional industries. And I look forward to working with Jennifer in her new capacity. Now, turning to the quarter. I will begin with a few brief comments, and then Qi will provide a business review, and Jennifer will present the financials. 2017 is shaping up to be a transformational year for Baidu, as we complete our strategic evolution to China's largest AI-centric technology company. We believe that a great technological revolution comparable to the industrial revolution is taking shape, representing a once-in-a generation opportunity that will create new commercial frontiers and transform a wide range of industries, such as auto, healthcare, education, financial services, and industrial automation. In the AI enabled era, the scenarios for human machine interaction will be much broader than what we've seen before. And as natural language understanding and image recognition power new information gateways, the new paradigms for human machine interaction will have significant implications for how people conduct their daily lives. I'm confident that Baidu's advantages in technology, specifically advanced AI research will position us to be the industry leader for the long-term. Search is one of the first applications of AI where search works to understand human. As the leading search engine in China, we have been fortunate to amass vast amounts of rich, valuable data in a market with over 700 million Internet users who speak the same language, have the same culture, and abide by the same laws. Moreover, we live in an age where we can finally match this data with powerful efficient computing infrastructure, and a deep bench of talent to make real progress in AI. We believe Baidu's opportunity to apply AI to real world consumer and enterprise applications in China is enormous. We envision a world where machines continue to learn about humans. In the not so distant future, using natural voice input or images to interact with machines will be mainstream, alleviating humans of the burden of mutant tasks. We imagine a world where your face is your identity and you only need to show your face to pay at the supermarket or goes through airport security. Cars will drive us, freeing up our time and attention. As machines become more like hyper efficient, real-time assistants for people, the mode of user interaction is evolving correspondingly. Just as the mouse and keyboard were the gateways in the PC era and touch is the gateway for mobile, voice recognition through conversational DuerOS will be the gateway in the China plus AI era. Our investment in AI is a long-term proposition with dividends that will be paid over the medium to long term. We're already seeing the powerful benefit of AI in our existing online advertising platform and in a more personalized, more image enhanced and more predictive search experience. Beyond the existing PC and mobile channels, AI will expand the scenarios and use cases for search in home, car, and work, and lower the friction for search through voice recognition, image recognition, and user personalization. Our strategy is clear and we're working hard on multiple fronts. I'll now turn the call over to Qi to go through our business progress. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Robin. To build on Robin's key points, operationally here at Baidu, we very much focus on building and applying AI technologies as the foundation of what we do, and the primary driver of product innovation and business growth. Over the past three months, I have spent the majority of my time working with our product and business teams to map out our strategy and the ways to drive high-performance execution. Our focus is two-fold, to enhance and expand our existing core business platform, and to lead the commercialization of AI technology across a number of AI-enabled new business initiatives, such as our AI-cloud, financial services, DuerOS, and autonomous driving. For our new business initiatives, we have gone through a rigorous and disciplined process to evaluate and select the most promising new business opportunities to pursue. Our criteria includes, category lifecycle, market penetration, Baidu's competitive position, differentiated value propositions, and our ability to execute. We will be shedding more light on the process and the progress of these new business initiatives, and sharing operating metrics as appropriate as we move forward. On our core business front, we are off to a good start, driving improvements in both traditional core search, as well as in our news feed product. Search is and will continue to be a fundamental user need, especially as we digitize more and more world information in our daily lives. We see much more room for innovation to deliver a better user experience with richer information using interactions as we expand search into more and more scenarios. For example, we are making great strides in enriching our search results, especially with video. In fact, now over 25% of mobile queries have rich video content as part of the search results, representing a material increase over last year. We are also making our search experience on mobile devices more natural and easy to navigate using touch. The experience is much more engaging, like that of our mobile native apps as compared to the traditional browser-based experience. This is achieved through intelligent filtering and the presentation technologies, based on our AI capabilities, in content and user intent understanding especially in more advanced areas, such as classification and object recognition in images and videos. With the twin engines of search and news feed, we have broadened our core product experience by complementing the explicit intent-driven, pull experience of the traditional search with implicit user understanding-driven, push experience of news feed. While we are pleased with the rapid user adoption of our news feed product with daily active users reaching 83 million this month, and the overall volumes of content distributions and the user time spent reaching a new weekly high, we will stay laser-focused on improving the user experience and building out our content platform, especially the number of content creators on our Baijiahao content platform has surpassed 450,000, more than doubling over last quarter, becoming an increasingly important part of the Baidu overall information ecosystem. Now, speak of ecosystem. Maps, Nuomi, and the Local Express continue to play a vital role in connecting users with local content and services, and helping local businesses connect with users through our search, feed and advertising products. Operationally in Q1, we consolidated Nuomi into our core business. Going forward, our focus for Nuomi will be building more and a better content of our local services and the monetization through advertising through Local Express, instead of just transactional business. All of these improvements to our core products and ecosystem are reflected in the growing engagement of our users, with the ratio of mobile search daily active users to monthly active users showing a clear upward trend. On the commercial product front, we added upgrades to our search ad platform, making click to connect ad formats available across search, Union and the news feed. This has yielded a notable lift in monetization. We are also actively developing and applying AI technologies across a number of key areas such as ad targeting, creative and landing page optimization, which will contribute to increasing monetization capabilities over time. While monetization is still at an early stage for news feed, customer feedback has been very positive, they view news feed traffic as incremental to their campaigns. Late last year, we also launched a dedicated news feed ad platform to complement news feed bidding within our search ad platform, and customer campaigns through this dedicated channel is ramping up at a rapid rate. Now turning to AI-enabled and new business initiatives. We are making good strides across the board, and here a few specific areas to call out. DuerOS is our next-generation conversational AI platform. By design, it provides powerful capabilities to enable the use of voice in natural language to interact with any digital experience on any device, for any scenario. This is because for the first time in our history, AI technology enables natural language to serve as a general purpose user interface. While it is still early, this platform will have enormous potential relative to the traditional platforms, because it can run everywhere, and it enable users to interact naturally and easily. We believe we are the clear market leader in China. DuerOS has already gained great momentum in building out its ecosystem. For example, we have secured broad partnership to power conversational AI services for Xiaomi and the Vivo smartphones, Lenovo smart TV, Haier, and Midea smart appliances, HARMAN smart speakers and many others across rapidly growing number of devices. Home and cars are two high value scenarios to anchor the DuerOS platform at this early phase. Here we have made important investments in our Raven Tech acquisitions, as well as our Internet of Vehicles business unit. Both of which will help further establish the DuerOS platform and strengthen our market leadership position. At the same time, both in their own right will have significant business opportunities that we will grow into. In Q1, we consolidate our L4 and L3 and Internet of Vehicle Business Unit into the new IDG, Intelligent Driving Group. This will enable us to build out a common technology platform, shared services, and a consistent solution for all our partners. At the Shanghai Auto Fair last week, we announced project Apollo, an open, complete, and reliable autonomous driving technology platform that we plan to launch in July. This is a historical opportunity to apply our AI technology strength to create an open innovation ecosystem that will empower all parties in the auto industry to accelerate the pace of innovation, enable more win-win partnerships, create greater business opportunities in this vast and rapidly growing market. The response from the industry and our partners has been very positive thus far. It is a big step forward. Our AI-cloud business named as ABC or AI Big Data and Cloud has been gaining traction with our customers, who appreciate our AI value-added approach. Baidu Cloud builds upon foundation of cloud solutions of computing, storage and CDN. We differentiate by providing AI technology enabled solutions, such as Big Data, deep learning, video, IoT and more. Customers across media, financial services, healthcare and other verticals have expressed very positive feedback. This month at the Baidu Cloud ABC summit, together with NVIDIA, we announced the establish of the Baidu Deep Learning platform which will greatly help our customers and partners to enhance their capability in Deep Learning and AI. Our Financial Services business continues to grow as our AI and Big Data capabilities serve as key differentiators that can intelligently target and match users with the right products, identify and prevent fraud and appropriately assess credit risk through our continuously increasing proprietary data and modeling capabilities. iQiyi, which celebrated its seventh anniversary this month, continued its sector leadership with ongoing improvements in revenue and paid subscriber numbers. In March, according to iResearch, iQiyi's mobile app maintained its top ranking with 129 million daily active users, 490 million monthly active users, and 342 billion minutes of monthly user time. We will continue to work closely with iQiyi to support its growth as part of the overall Baidu ecosystem. Baidu Deliveries with its first rate service quality and clear technology advantage made a strong progress in the quarter, seeing healthy revenue growth year-over-year. In March, during the International Women's Week, Baidu Deliveries ran a highly successful special joint promotion with Yum China's KFC and the Pizza Hut brands. In conclusion, we are very pleased with our progress in Q1, and we are more confident and energized about using AI to elevate our core products and the business and to create long-term values through our next-generation AI enabled new business initiatives. With that, I will turn it over to Jennifer to go through the financials. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Qi. Hello, everyone. In the first quarter, we bought back about $200 million of our own stock. We are very confident in Baidu's long-term outlook, and this decision is consistent with our overall capital allocation framework. We had a solid first quarter with the business performing to our expectations. As we're moving from mobile first to AI first, we work to align our business operations by folding Nuomi into our core business. Nuomi will play a role to serve as part of the core business' content and service ecosystem. We'll continue to scale back spend for Nuomi, and shift Nuomi from a take-rate transaction based business model to an advertising-based business model, which leverages our core business. We do not expect Nuomi to be a significant contributor to margin drag going forward. Other components in Transaction Services such as Maps, Financial Services, and Baidu Deliveries are also part of our core businesses content and service ecosystem, with Financial Services and Baidu Deliveries very much leveraging our AI capabilities. Baidu Deliveries continues to show improving operational efficiency, and a visible path to sustainability and profitability. Consistent with our strategic and operational focus to build our core business and invest in AI, we intend to realign our segment reporting, and fold Transaction Services into our core business. Starting next quarter, we'll report Baidu Core as a whole and Transaction Services will no longer be a separate segment. As Robin and Qi have shared, and as we have been communicating to you in the past few quarters, AI is the core of our strategy, and is both the foundation of our existing platform and driver of vast opportunities going forward. We are continuously leveraging our existing technology capabilities, and devoting resources to our AI-enabled initiatives of enterprise cloud, financial services, DuerOS and autonomous driving. The majority of these investments are on the R&D front, which we expect to bear fruit in the medium to longer term. This year, we expect incremental R&D expenses over 2016 to be all related to AI. Incremental R&D spend this year is largely related to AI R&D head count. As a reminder, as disclosed in our 20-F form, we disposed of our mobile gaming business for RMB 1.2 billion, a transaction which is expected to close mid-May. After mid-May, we will no longer recognize revenue for the mobile gaming business. The mobile gaming business contributed close to 3% of total revenue in 2016. Now moving to the financials, all monetary amounts are in RMB unless otherwise stated. For the first quarter, total revenues were RMB 16.9 billion, representing a 6.8% increase from the corresponding period in 2016. During the first quarter, Baidu had approximately 451,000 active online marketing customers, representing a 23% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 and flat compared to the previous quarter. Revenue per online marketing customer for the first quarter was RMB 32,200, a 27% increase from the corresponding period in 2016, and a 9% decrease compared to the prior quarter. Traffic acquisition cost as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 was RMB 2.2 billion, representing a 12.9% of total revenues compared to 14.1% in the corresponding period in 2016, and 14.5% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Bandwidth costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 1.3 billion, representing 7.9% of total revenues compared to 6.9% in the corresponding period in 2016. Depreciation costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 823 million, representing 4.9% of total revenues compared to 4.5% in Q1 of 2016. Operational costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 959 million, representing 5.7% of total revenue compared to 6.9% in Q1 last year. Content costs as a component of cost of revenue in Q1 were RMB 2.6 billion, representing 15.6% of total revenue, compared to 8.7% in the corresponding period in 2016. This increase was mainly due to iQiyi's increased content costs. SG&A expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, representing a decrease of 29% from corresponding period in 2016. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in promotional spending for transaction services. R&D expenses in Q1 were RMB 2.8 billion, a 35% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. The increase was mainly due to growth of R&D personnel related expenses. Share-based compensation expenses, which were allocated to related operating and expense line items, increased in aggregate to RMB 631 million in Q1 from RMB 309 million in the corresponding period in 2016. This year-over-year increase was a result of increased share grants to employees. Operating profit for Q1 was RMB 2 billion, representing a 9.3% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Non-GAAP operating profit was RMB 2.6 billion, a 4.6% increase over the corresponding period in 2016. Income tax expenses was RMB 405 million for the first quarter. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18.6% compared to 25.4% in Q1 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate reflected our operating loss narrowed for some loss-generating entities in the group. Net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 1.8 billion, a 10.6% decrease from the corresponding period in 2016. Basic and diluted earnings per ADS for the first quarter amounted to RMB 4.65 and RMB 4.63, respectively. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Baidu for Q1 was RMB 2.4 billion, a 1.3% increase year-on-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per ADS for Q1 was RMB 6.85. As of Q1, the company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of RMB 90.7 billion. Net operating cash flow (sic) [inflow] (28:38) and capital expenditures for the first quarter were RMB 4.7 billion and RMB 1.2 billion, respectively. Total head count on a consolidated basis including invested entities was about 43,400, as of the end of first quarter of 2017. This represents a decrease of 5.5% as compared to the end of last year (sic) [quarter] (29:04). Now let me provide you with our top-line guidance for the second quarter of 2017. We currently expect total revenue for the second quarter to be between RMB 20.47 billion and RMB 20.98 billion, representing an annual increase of 12.1% to 14.9% and the sequential increase of 21.2% to 24.2%. Please note, this forecast reflects Baidu's current and preliminary view, and is subject to change. I will now open the call to questions. Operator, please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

The question-and-answer session of this conference call will start in a moment. Your first question comes from the line of Eddie Leung from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Eddie Leung - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning. First of all, my best wishes to Jennifer for your next role. And then for my questions, I'm wondering if you could share more color with us on the different components of your revenue guidance for the second quarter, especially any color on the contribution of our subscription and the newer business, mobile news feed will be helpful? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi, Eddie. Thank you for your kind words. With regards to Q2 revenue, as you look at our business, essentially it's the core business as well as iQiyi that are the main revenue contributors. Within the core business, there is search, we're also putting a lot of efforts in the feed. The feed product, as Qi mentioned earlier, from a user adoption perspective, it's progressing very well. We're in the early stage of monetizing the product. So we had not been very much focused on or driving aggressively on the monetization front. So for our core business, it continues to be very search centric, and we are very excited to expand the service we can offer to our users and advertisers, and we expect a solid progress in that regard, and we should expect the search business to extend over the next few quarters. For the iQiyi business, as you would have seen from our 20-F, last year iQiyi had a very solid growth and the contribution to our overall business. iQiyi is integral part of the overall Baidu ecosystem, and they continue to deliver very strong top-line growth driven by the business model of the subscription user base. So if you look at Q2, sequentially, you continue – Q1, sequentially you continue to observe other revenue line continues to grow quarter-on-quarter, and a big part of that is iQiyi's a subscription user business. So iQiyi's revenue growth is on solid ground, the two engine advertising as well as subscription fees continue to grow very well. So we're still on the path of recovery from last year's incident, and search is ramping up very nicely. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chi Tsang from HSBC. Please go ahead. Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Good morning, everybody, and again congratulations, Jennifer, on this next opportunity. I wanted to ask you about core search. In particular, I was wondering if you can touch on traffic as well as demand. On the traffic front, what are you guys seeing in terms of growth in traffic and maybe growth in paid clicks year-to-date? And I'm wondering, if you expect paid clicks to grow faster this year than last year? And then, in terms of demand, given the rebasing of your customer base, as well as with higher standards, what type of customer growth do you expect this year? Thanks so much. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I'm going to take the first cut on Chi's question, and Qi and Robin can feel free to add. The traffic as overall continues to be very solid, mobile continues to be growing nicely, and a bigger proportion of the overall traffic. As you know, I mentioned earlier, the feed product is also we're busy developing that and seeing good progress on that. So from our product service perspective, we have the nicer search traffic as well as user engagement, that user has more time and interesting topics that they can view on the Baidu platform. For us to build in more of these inventories, it create more of the user products, it provides a bigger advertising pool and inventory for our advertisers. So I think going into 2017, later in the quarter, we should continue to expect that the paid clicks will power the growth of monetization. From a – the other question? Chi Tsang - The Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp. Ltd. Customers, yeah. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Customer, customer wise also, I think seasonally Q1 was a low quarter, and I think for the remainder of the year, as we have richer product for our advertisers and our sales force, refocus their efforts to develop the market, we should expect the customer base to grow as well. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me just add to what Jennifer described. With regard to search traffic, as we mentioned earlier, we view search as a fundamental human need, user need, and as we digitize more and more information, digitize more and more daily activities, the search overall demand will increase, that's number one. Number two, in current forms user express their intent through keywords, query input, landing on a set of information that will see its natural pace of growth as you have seen – our industry in China has been expanding so far. However, what I'll emphasize there is through AI technology innovations, we believe we can over time expand our search traffic by additional user experiences, for example you can search based on voice, you can search based on image, and more and more content will be available for search. So our focus is tapping into the current trend of user traffic growth for sure. At the same time, focusing on building better experience, more search capabilities, expanding into more search scenarios over time to expand search traffic. On the click, paid click side, again the pattern will be similar. The focus would be using AI technologies to understand the user intent better, and enable that to expose to advertisers, to our business customers, so that advertisers will have over time richer opportunities to place their campaigns as part of product, so that we have more opportunities to tap into the ongoing growing demand of advertising needs. So netted out, there's existing forms that's growing at its current pace and we're also focusing on tapping into future user traffic and future paid click growth opportunities through AI, through technological based enablement. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alicia Yap from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Alicia Yap - Citigroup Hi. Thank you. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer and Dr. Lu. Thanks for taking my questions. My questions is related to margins, so your comments of the operating margin including Baidu Core versus the Transaction Service, where Transaction Service 16.8% point reduction, does that mean in Q1, the margin on the Transaction Service only include the Baidu Takeout Delivery and the Map, but the Nuomi expenses is now part of the Baidu Core. And then how should we be thinking about the overall core margins in the future with news feed becoming a more meaningful part of the contributions? And then related to that, I wanted to ask about the content costs on the iQiyi front, is all the RMB 2.6 billion in Q1 is all related to iQiyi? Is there anything on that is related to the news feed content? And then with iQiyi recent licensing deal with Netflix, does the content cost guidance of doubling year-over-year this year still hold true, or should we expect even more than double in the content costs? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you, Alicia. So a few questions. First of all, the margin drag that we reported on Transaction Services was reported on the same concept and definition, consistent with the prior quarters. This is to give you an idea, and you can clearly see that we're reducing the investments on this front and we're shifting from mobile to AI. And so for your specific comment, Nuomi was included in this number and included in the Transaction Services, as a reminder, also has Financial Services, Baidu Delivery, Map and Nuomi, and so these are the main components. As I mentioned earlier, we'll continue to reduce spend on Nuomi and the other elements within the old transaction services sector has to do with core search or AI related initiatives. So, it doesn't really make sense for Transaction Service to stand as a separate sector, but for your information it's more to giving you an indication for this quarter that we are reducing spend on this front. For news feed, as mentioned before, news feed carries a different margin profile, and we're in the early stage of developing its business model from an advertising perspective. Currently, we're focusing on driving the user experience, user adoption, so investment related to feed has to do with the ecosystem buildup, content acquisition, R&D efforts, and some you can say infrastructure related, bandwidth and depreciation related to servers, because we're building the user traffic on the front. We haven't really focused on the advertising effort, but as Qi mentioned earlier, the business model is pretty apparent and the customers are quite open and acceptive to this advertising model. So, over time, we will ramp up the advertising and monetization capability. But at this point, it's very early stage. With regards to the content cost for Q1, yes, predominantly a biggest of majority of the Q1 content expense was iQiyi related. And as we mentioned earlier, our expectation is this year there will be a very important content investment mainly for iQiyi and also partly related to our feed product. The overall guidance we provided earlier that the content cost will likely go up the same percentage as before that estimate is still hold. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alan Hellawell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Alan Hellawell - Deutsche Bank AG (Hong Kong) Great. I just wanted to join the chorus in thanking Jennifer for setting a high watermark in the industry as a CFO, and also wish her the very best in her new role. A question around the interplay between demand for our search and news feed products. I can see key accounts scratching up new incremental budget to buy news feed ad, but I wonder if it is more cannibalistic to our budget limited SMEs that generally prefer the more focused sales generation aspects of buying a keyword to the more impression based aspect of news feed ad. And then just a quickie, a disclosure-related question. By folding in Transaction Services to Core search, are we no longer going to segregate out margin drag from Transaction Services and maybe even iQiyi? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first answer the first part of the question about on the demand side. The evidence so far has been showing a overall healthy growth and a specific evidence, I'll call out, is that, we have enabled our customers to place their campaign and budget in two ways. One is through their search campaign, they can indicate how much to go to the feeds, and there is also a separate interface that they can explicitly say, these budget will be on the feed side. There's a clear upward trend, a very rapid growth for customers, explicitly placing more campaign budget on the feed side, while maintaining their search campaign, search budget, and that's a clear signs of healthy growth, overall growth for our advertising needs for combined search and the feed products, number one. Number two, over time, we'll become more apparent that feed in many ways enable brand advertising to have a meaningful play at platforms. This is again very early. We're more focused on getting user experience to be truly, truly compelling and grow our user base and time spent. But from campaign demand perspective, our combined search and feed will enable more overall growth, not just from the traditional performance-based advertising into brand awareness based advertising as well. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And Alan, to your second question, yes, we're folding Transaction Services into Core, however, we will continue to separately identify iQiyi as a separate segment and report separately its margin impact on a quarterly basis. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Yao from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Alex Yao - JPMorgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd. Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I have a question on the Apollo project you guys announced recently. Does that make your autonomous car research project, open source type of the project, which will potentially impact your monetization capability. If it's not, can you help us understand your future project for monetizing the autonomous car driving initiative? Thank you. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. That's a terrific question. As a matter of fact, I can tell you, my goal for project Apollo is to expand our monetization opportunities ahead, a real plausible path towards future economic value creation for Baidu. Specifically, let me give you the thumbnail of what Apollo is and comment on the business opportunities. First of all, as I described, it's open and compete in the reliable platforms. So we're open code, we're open software and then we're also open capabilities that through APIs. And we're also providing core services as the overall part of the platforms. The overarching design is any players in the auto industry with Apollo, you can put together the complete vehicle using off the shelf hardware components, and be able to run with different intelligent driving scenarios, and all the way up until 2020, towards fully autonomous driving. So that's the overarching vision by design. It's open innovation ecosystem. The key here is design point of that ecosystem, because the epic innovation center for the auto industry will be in data, in algorithms, in rapid pace of innovations towards intelligent driving. And Apollo is designed in that way, and I can tell you my personal experience, the Hadoop ecosystem, the core base come from my Yahoo! teams. And I personally witnessed through if you picked the right design point for the industry, you can tap into the vast growth and emphasize vast growth a win-win with all partners, and yet at the same times enable Baidu to tap into the economic opportunities. Now without going into the specifics, what I can point to you is, there is known ways of monetizing open networks, whether it's services, packaged softwares, components, solutions, all these options are available to Baidu to tap into. That's number one. Number two, the response from auto partners from industries has been, I could say, overwhelmingly positive, and our confidence of our ability to tap into the new rapid growth through the Apollo ecosystem and our ability to monetize is increased substantially, going forward. So it's a terrific question. Baidu not only want to enable a healthy ecosystem, but let's all make money in our way and grow the whole pie together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Juan Lin from 86Research. Please go ahead. Juan Lin - 86Research Ltd. Hi. Good morning, Robin, Jennifer, Dr. Lu, and congratulations Jennifer on the new role. I have a question on the mobile gaming business. You mentioned that revenue contribution of mobile gaming business is around 3% of total revenue. I'm wondering what is the contribution to our profit. And after disconnecting this business, are you going to monetize the mobile game related traffic, which was previously directed to the mobile gaming business? Do you think that disconnecting business will eventually lead to a more efficient usage of your traffic in terms of monetization? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Hi. Mobile game, yes, as I said earlier, it contributed close to 3% of revenue last year. The game business operate, as you can see, is relatively small in our overall picture, and it doesn't generate the kind of margin as we do from our main business. So this transaction is actually a very good transaction for both us and the parties involved, and also it brings some good level of gains for us. For us, mobile game sector is always a very attractive sector for advertising business. And we do expect that even in the past, with mobile game operations, we have game advertising income and going forward, we will continue to develop this market and grow the mobile game advertiser base. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Natalie Wu from CICC. Please go ahead. Natalie Wu - CICC Hi. Good morning, management. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, I want to extend my best regards to Jennifer on her new role. And my question is regarding the margin of the Core business excluding Transaction Service and iQiyi, which seems to be declined quite a lot in the first quarter despite savings from traffic acquisition costs. So just wondering is it mainly due to the AI-related investment, or is there any other factors behind that? And how should we look at the trend going forward? And also just a little bit clarification on the mobile game, so that the consolidation of mobile game business will be since mid-May, right, so that is to say your current guidance is reflecting half quarter's consolidation of the game-related revenue? Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thank you for the question. Yes, for Q1, I think a couple of factors to think about as you look at the margins for Core. Mainly for Core, a couple of things are going about. One is, we're still recovering from, for our search service from the last year's incident. It has not been fully recovered. We're on the good path, it's ramping up, it's performing as expected. The other thing is the investment related to feed. As I mentioned earlier, early stage in terms of monetization, but we are very focused on building feed as a very solid and good complementary product to our search service. Related to that, our bandwidth, depreciation, R&D, content cost and also channel distribution investment to help mobile Baidu be more prominent among the user base. So that's the other factor going in Q1. And the third element, as you mentioned, AI investment, you have seen R&D expense increased year-on-year. As I mentioned earlier, the incremental spend would all be related to AI initiatives. AI initiatives are an integral part of our core service. It build upon the core technology capabilities and infrastructure capabilities. So that's what's driving the Q1's margin performance. For your second question with regards to mobile games, yes, you are correct. So basically, as I mentioned earlier, mobile game contributed to Q1 overall financial performance, it will only have about half of that in the Q2 period. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. So, Jennifer, what I would just add to emphasize the AI investment part, the placeholder (53:03) I would like to emphasize is, we will be very disciplined and systematically optimize our resource allocations to make sure that our engineering investments and R&D investment is truly tap into the substantial growth opportunities ahead of us. And we're going through lot of work across different teams to make sure that our resource allocation utilization is fully optimized towards two fundamental focus. One is elevating our current core business, we see a lot of growth opportunities ahead, and at the same time accelerating the commercialization of AI-enabled business. So, being disciplined and being very systemically in optimization is very important to us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Piyush Mubayi from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Piyush Mubayi - Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC Thank you for taking my question. First, Jennifer, congratulations on your new role. We wish you the best in your future endeavors. My question is directed to Qi at this point. We recognized that Baidu is strongly positioned in AI R&D. As the business model evolves in the medium-term, could you give us a glimpse into the range of operating metrics that become relevant, so we can better understand and appreciate the new world we're getting into? And very specifically as we go into a face, voice, and image recognition based world that AI would bring about versus the current search monetization model in place, how do you think that's going to change? Thank you. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Well, thank you. Thank you for the questions. So, let me first comment on your first question with regard to operating metrics. First, myself, my teams are very, very focused on accelerating the commercialization of our AI-enabled new businesses, and because the core of AI technology is about efficiently extract knowledge from data, and our focus is first of all establish very, very compelling user scenarios, and users and usage are important part of metrics. And the second is the data and iteration (sic) [integration] (55:26) rate, how we can iterate (sic) [integrate] (55:28) based on the data that we have in our systems. And the third is rapidly explore business models and monetization capabilities. And adding up together, we are developing our overall operating frameworks and operating dashboards, these are the type of things, Jennifer, myself, our teams collectively look at every week, every months, and we're focusing on driving a disciplined and accelerated pace of execution on commercializing the AI initiative, AI-enabled new business initiatives. As I mentioned in my prepared speech earlier, as we move forward when appropriate, we will shed more light with the investor communities about those operating metrics, because it would take time to evolve, but what I can show you is our teams are staying very, very focused to be very disciplined and rigorous in accelerating our pace forward. With regard to your question about modality change, on the consumer side, our current view is that will not fundamentally affect the economic patterns, because even if you use voice instead of using keyboards, you still express your intent, and once we understand user intent, and we understand the content that users try to seek to access, we will be able to place match that in a good way, and existing models of advertising or other forms will be equally applicable in that scenario. So, at this stage, we do not see a fundamental shift even though modality may change, the economic opportunity in front of us will be equally compelling as we have seen up to this point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Karen Chan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Karen Chan - Jefferies Hong Kong Ltd. Thank you management for taking my question. Congratulations to Jennifer on your new role. My first question is related to Core margins. So it is negatively impacted partly by the initial ramp up of mobile news feed ad. So how should we think about normalized margin level once the mobile news feed app reach a certain scalability? And my second question is regarding our monetization timeline of DuerOS apps with the AI-enabled home device partnership we secured. Wondering if management can share any color on that? Thanks. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Thanks, Karen. I'll take the first part and Qi can help address the second. As I mentioned earlier, currently the margin doesn't reflect a true picture. I think we mentioned earlier, feed is a product that's going to carry a different margin profile. But overall, I think just purely focusing on margins is just one angle. It's more important to think about the overall service and revenue opportunities that we can generate because of the product of search. The core search continues to be a very fundamental need, and that business model is beautiful and scalable and high margin. First for feed to complement the search service, we give our advertisers a much bigger advertising inventory, and the advertisers, big or small, can have more budget allocated with us. So for us to think about feed because it is a push kind of product, it's different from search. The overall it's a mix, it's a more beautiful and more integrated, and richer service that we provide, and I think it's important to look at the bigger market value we can potentially tap. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. Let me comment on the second part of question with regard to DuerOS monetization and its timeline. And here is how we think about DuerOS, its position in the industry, and now we shed light on how we think about monetization. First of all, DuerOS is the AI generation user experience platform, very similar to iOS and Android. iOS, Android is really for fingers, the device sitting in everybody's pocket. DuerOS, the fundamental interaction is natural language and voice based and it's everywhere. It's on every device, in every scenario. So it's a platform in that regard. The second, DuerOS is also a new entry point, because as you use DuerOS more and more in your home, in your car, say, play the next song for me, order pizza that becomes a new entry. So it plays dual role as a experienced platform, a new form of entry. On the entry side, the monetization is very natural. This is very similar to today's information gateway, like search. And the timeline will be the amount of scale that we can grow into, and there will be natural opportunities we can tap into. The second is about the platforms. Traditionally, there are several dimension with platform economics. If you look at iOS and Android, there is ways to run a app store type models, you can get economical value. There is VIG for the applications that builds on top of the platforms, and at the same time DuerOS also strategically bring additional demand to our ABC cloud. So we can also indirectly monetize through that vehicles. So having said all of that, our focus right now is really grow the ecosystem. We're doing a good job. Our team is really racing ahead, every day, every week, we're signing up new partners. So our focus is on scale. But as I said, we see ourselves as a clear leader in China and the opportunities over time will be tremendous. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Grace Chen from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Grace Chen - Morgan Stanley Taiwan Ltd. Hello. Hi. Thank you for taking my question. The question is about the search business. From the Q2 sales guidance, we can see that the search sales should be recovering on both QoQ and then year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand what are the key drivers for the sales recovery in terms of market segments? And also can you comment on the competitive landscape, in the advertising business in general, for example, from like social and e-commerce peers? And also on the margin for search business, as we've just discussed that, we can see that margin have been contracting in the past two quarters for a couple of reasons. So with the sales recovery and margins recover (sic) [recovery] (62:06), so can you give us a guidance about the reasonable margin level of the search business? Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. I think for us, as you noted correctly, the business is recovering and rebuilding. The factors that we look at, many other factors have a lot of potential, specifically education, real estate, local services, like even retail continues to be very strong. I mentioned earlier also like the sectors like games, could be a lot of possibilities too. So as we look forward, search continues to have a lot of verticals that we can further develop and service our customers better, and with complementary feed products to service even bigger customer pools. I think for us to look at the overall business performance, it's our focus to run a highly efficient business. We have always steered our resources towards strategically important areas. As we identified AI as our key strategic focus, a lot of the effort is focusing on the R&D side, in particular, related to talent. So as I mentioned, if you look at the margin performance for the year, I have given a pretty clear indication in terms of how you look at our overall business. Basically this year, I think for us, we've talked about content that's related to iQiyi and our overall ecosystem build up. I talked about R&D that's related to talent, specifically for AI. And I think these are the main items and the rest of us is to focus on execution. No specific margin guidance, but I think I hope the information we provided is helpful for you to construct your margin picture. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. With regard to competitions, what I will emphasize is, first, we are clearly the market leaders, particularly in search market share on mobiles, and that's number one. Number two, our focus is on innovations, our focus on expanding the search scenarios, particularly expand search capability, so that search experience is fundamentally natural to a mobile device and tap into the rich capabilities such as camera and speech, so that over times we will be more compelling. And last, I will say is search at its core is a scaling business. There is a fundamental scaling impact. As market leaders, we want to fully leverage that, so that our technological capabilities with the new AI at the core will understand user better than any other, and understand content better than any others. So over time, we are confident that we will be able to maintain a strong market leadership position. Robin Yanhong Li - Baidu, Inc. So let me just add on the search revenue side. I think the search business has been a very traffic bound business. Advertisers or customers they all want to buy more traffic, and the performance is unmatched by any other type of media online or offline. So our focus has been and will continue to be on growing the search traffic, so we're not worried about other type of advertisement from other type of media. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ming Xu from UBS. Please go ahead. Ming Xu - UBS Securities (Asia) Ltd. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I have two questions. The first one is on the news feed side. So, if you name one key area to improve on the user experience of news feed, so I'm wondering whether it's – what is that, whether it's recommendation algorithm or targeting or content or something others. Could you help us understand. And secondly, my second question is on CPC. I think from 20-F, we know that last year, the number of paid clicks actually (66:45) more quickly than revenue growth indicating that the CPC is actually down. So you just mentioned that this year the paid clicks will continue to grow. So could you also comment on the CPC trend? Thanks. Qi Lu - Baidu, Inc. Let me first talk about the feed side, good question. If there is one thing for us to focus is the quality of the matching algorithms, because the search product fundamentally is about deeply understand a user, the user's interest, the information needs, on the other hand understand the content, but that's core is about matching them together. So the areas for us to focus on or the top priority areas is the quality of the matching algorithm, so that we can sustainably improve the overall user satisfaction and grow the base of that product. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. And on your second question, yes, last year – if you recall, last year, we took effort to have a higher standard for our customers. And as a result, a lot of the customers are removed or unable to do business with us. For search, it is a bidding business model, when you have less like a smaller advertiser pool, the bidding will not be as intense. So that in itself can affect the CPC. However, looking at the paid click trend, you will notice that for this kind of phenomenon to occur, our advertisers are actually having better ROIs for the business. It continues to speak to this high performance nature of paid search and it's just a matter of transition now we're going through that CPC was a result of that, but that's not something that I feel should be worrisome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Evan Zhou from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Evan Zhou - Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Ltd. Hi, Jennifer. Thank you for taking my questions. Just lastly, I wanted to ask an update about Baidu Financial Services, wondering whether this is actually becoming more of a visible or higher contribution portion within the other revenue being recognized in the first quarter, and how is the kind of profitability improvement within this segment for our business, because we have also seen some across industry, the overall growth, and profitability has improved a lot in the past few months. So I wonder if I can get an update on that. Thank you. Jennifer Xinzhe Li - Baidu, Inc. Yeah. For our Financial Services business, it does generate financing income, and that would flow through other revenue. It's still in its early stage, and having us building the fundamental capability like leveraging data and algorithm to have better modeling for credit risk underwriting would be the focus. So if you would see that we position our Financial Services business as a Fintech business, and we do originations and wealth management to help train our models, and so that we can really get better handling of the much richer data that we have and the technology capability. So Financial Services itself as effort is progressing very well, and I think it's on the path of getting more stronger fundamental capability in helping using the technology and a different angle to look at the Financial Services business.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin Pharmaceutical including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's products and programs, actions of regulatory authority, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical markets and developments by competitors, and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission such as 10-Q, 10-K and 8-K reports. On the call today from the BioMarin management team are J.J. Bienaimé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President of Global R&D; Dan Spiegelman, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Ajer, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, Executive Vice President of Technical Operations. I'd like to now turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J.J. Bienaimé. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We begin 2017 with a record-breaking quarter and a 28% increase in top line revenues to $304 million driven by the growth of each product in our commercial pipeline. In the quarter, our GAAP net loss was reduced to $16 million and we reported a non-GAAP income of $35 million. In addition in the quarter, our commercial organization not only focused on growing the base business, but also prepared for the launch of our six approved product, Brineura for the treatment of CLN2 which is a form of Batten disease. So we are very pleased to have received this approval last week from the FDA and also a positive CHMP opinion from the European health authorities in the prior week. The collaborative interaction we had with both agencies, who have the review process, illustrates a fairly even therapy that treats rare and ultra rare disorders, not to mention the tremendous unmet medical need for these patients. The flexibility shown by both the U.S. and EU is an important reminder of the value that targeted therapy can make in molecularly well-defined patient population. Our commercial organization has commenced the commercial launch of Brineura in the U.S. and we look forward to starting our commercial rollouts in the rest of the world territories following an approval in Europe, which should come at the end of the second quarter. Needless to say, we are very thrilled for families who are in the need of Brineura, and we wanted to thank everyone who helped execute this rapid approval. For the remainder of 2017, we look forward to advancing all of our development pipeline programs, including BMN 270 gene therapy for hemophilia A. In July at the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis or ISTH in Berlin, we plan to give you an update on this program including data on the seven 6 x 1013 vg/kg high-dose patients all of whom have been already in therapy for at least a year now. We will send our details shortly for investor event on July 10, so stay tuned for more information as we get closer to this event. Later this quarter, we'll be on track to file our BLA for pegvaliase which is our next potential approval, and in addition, the vosoritide and BMN 250 programs continue to advance. In conclusion, we begin 2017 having achieved the goals we anticipated and for the remainder of the year, we look forward to moving all of our patent programs forward, which Hank will review shortly. With last week's approval of Brineura, we now have six commercial products, making BioMarin the pure-play leader in the field of rare and ultra-rare disorders. The financial results announced today demonstrate our commitment to moving toward profitability through our ability to grow the top-line and manage expenses, while still continuing to invest in developing innovative new products for rare and ultra-rare disorders. And now we'll turn the call to Jeff who will review the commercial business in more detail. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, J.J. In addition to being extremely pleased with the financial results in the first quarter, the commercial organization has begun the U.S. launch of Brineura. Bearing in mind the nuances of treating the CLN2 patient population as we shared last week, our strategy is focused on building disease awareness and facilitating diagnosis of children early in the course of the disease. Our ultimate goal is to get children diagnosed when they are candidates that maximally benefit from Brineura. Over time, we anticipate more and earlier diagnosis of CLN2 patients combined with the impact of therapy to lead to a substantial increase in patients for Brineura. Turning briefly to first quarter of 2017 results, we were pleased to announce an increase of 28% year-over-year total BioMarin revenues. Starting with Vimizim, net product revenues increased to $106 million in the quarter, a 45% year-over-year increase primarily driven by 31% growth in new patients on therapy. Some forward buying positively impacted the quarter for markets in the Middle East and South Korea. While we received Q1 orders from Brazil for each of Vimizim and Naglazyme, we continue to expect the inconsistent order patterns could persist from Brazil this year. Year-over-year patient numbers increased by 250, and in the quarter, we added one new market for a total of 42 Vimizim markets. We are extremely pleased with the continued robust commercial uptake of Vimizim and look forward to further penetration in global markets. Turning to Kuvan. Net product revenues increased to $92 million in the quarter, an increase of 19% year-over-year driven by strong commercial patient gains of 8% in the U.S. Kuvan business in international markets is performing according to expectations where we are identifying and pursuing growth opportunities. In addition to our EU patent that provides Kuvan exclusivity through 2024 in that important region, we announced on April 13 that we had entered into a settlement agreement with Par Pharmaceutical to resolve patent litigation in the United States providing continued exclusivity to October 2020. We view our leadership in the PKU market with Kuvan as an important opportunity for BioMarin in advance of potential regulatory developments with pegvaliase. Finally, moving to Naglazyme, net product revenues grew to $81 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Patients on Naglazyme therapy continue to show consistent growth with an increase of 9% year-over-year. Growth in the quarter benefited from forward buying in markets in the Middle East and the effect of a Brazil Q1 order this year compared to the absence of an order in Q1 2016. In closing, the commercial team delivered strong results in the first quarter of 2016 with net product revenues 28% higher than the same period last year. We remain on track to meet our full year revenue guidance of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion and reaffirm guidance provided last quarter for individual products. I'm very pleased with the level of demand we are seeing for Vimizim worldwide. Our presence with Kuvan in global markets will be an important factor as we prepare for potential approval and commercialization of pegvaliase, and in addition, we are underway with U.S. launch of Brineura and look forward to launching in the EU upon a decision expected later in the second quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Hank to provide an update on our development programs. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Jeff. And it is hard to believe that I will no longer be including Brineura in my commentary now that it's on its way to being a commercialized product. Needless to say, we're thrilled with the recent FDA approval with a positive CHMP opinion and look forward to helping Jeff seeing brand Brineura to the children who need it as soon as we can. Moving now to development updates for our next potential approved products. All of our pipeline programs advanced to the quarter laying groundwork for their next stage of growth. Starting with pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria. At our last update, we communicated that U.S. health authorities were interested in additional immunology data and that we had chosen to update the safety database. We are now nearly finished conducting the analyses requested by the Food and Drug Administration, and there's essentially no change in the findings of the program we have shared as part of our pivotal study update last year. That is pegvaliase substantially lowers phenylalanine in patients. As we have said, lowering phenylalanine is primarily dependent on the level of their immune response, which can be safely managed through the induction, titration and maintenance strategies that have been tested in clinical trials. Importantly, longer-term safety data continue to convey tolerability of pegvaliase and continuation on treatment remains strong. We're making plans to incorporate the patient's voice in the review consistent with the Food and Drug Administration's increasing interest in patient-focused drug development. We believe this will be an important aspect of the review as current options for patients are quite limited and relatively unpalatable. Finally, the company is progressing on plans to support post approval commitments as may be deemed necessary during review. All told, we're quite pleased with the progress being made on pegvaliase and look forward to providing further updates as the submissions occur. Turning to vosoritide. When we last updated on progress, we enrolled the first patient on the randomized study that is an important element in establishing the benefit of vosoritide in promoting increased growth velocity. We're now finalizing plans to acquire final adult height data from a current population of achondroplasia, children and adults, to facilitate interpretation of longer term growth outcomes, also known as final adult height, and proportionality. To further our knowledge, we are implementing pilot studies to understand the relationship of height and function, support improvements in patient functionality. We're modifying our infant/toddler program to enable investigation of earlier intervention with vosoritide. Recall that obtaining information about infants and toddlers has become an increasingly important part of BioMarin's genetic disease development programs, evidenced by conducting a small post-approval study with Naglazyme, a larger study with Vimizim, and a small study with Brineura, and now a study in younger children with vosoritide. Most importantly, we continue to believe that vosoritide did present an important option for those patients and families who desire to improve growth outcomes and are unsatisfied with available surgical options in the absence of available medical therapy. And finally, turning to BMS 270 for gene therapy for severe hemophilia A, we have now completed dosing of six patients with a 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose and look forward to having some preliminary efficacy data. The focus of our updated ISTH will be data from patients who had a 6 x 1013 vg/kg dose, many of whom have been on therapy for well over a year. Recall that based on the 6 x 1013 vg/kg data and work by others, it takes roughly 16 to 24 weeks from dosing for Factor VIII levels to reach steady state. And this will be available in the 4 x 1013 vg/kg patients later this year. We're also preparing to update on long-term outcomes, quality of life, steroid use and liver function at ISTH either in presentation and/or at an investor event at the upcoming meeting. On interactions with health authorities, we've completed one round of discussion with the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency on the path to registration, working to harmonize feedback, finalize the program studies to support fastest and best path to approval. On the manufacturing front, we're well past shovels in the ground for our facility and believe material from this facility will be available to be included in the registration enabling study in the spring of 2018. In summary, we are extremely pleased with the productivity coming out of the worldwide development organization. We have learned so much over the past years on how to best focus our development programs to enable rapid and effective drug development in BioMarin. Coming off the recent FDA approval of Brineura after three years and eight months in development, my team and I are more inspired than ever to continue our good work for the benefit of patients with rare and ultra rare disorders. Thank you so much for your support. And I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to review the financial results in more detail. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Hank. I refer you to today's press release for a full detail summarizing our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Starting with top line results, as J.J. and Jeff have already described, total BioMarin revenues for the first quarter of 2017 were $304 million driven by strong growth across the entire commercial portfolio. In terms of foreign exchange impacts, year-over-year exchange rate movement did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as losses due to the weakening of the euro and the British pound against the dollar were largely offset by improvements in key Latin American currencies and gains on our hedging contracts. Moreover, we expect that trend to continue for the full-year and do not currently project a significant impact to foreign exchange on full-year revenues in 2017. As Jeff noted, full-year revenue guidance is on-track for $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, which at the midpoint would reflect the 14% year-over-year revenue increase. The approval of reserve will provide important support towards our goal of ensuring year-over-year revenue increases throughout the remainder of the decade. Moving to operating expenses, R&D expenses decreased to $145 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $158.8 million in the first quarter of 2016 due to the maturing stage of development of our product development portfolio. We would expect R&D expenses to ramp up throughout the remainder of the year primarily due to the increasing enrollment in our vosoritide Phase 3 study, which started at the very end of last year and the start in Q3 of our registration-enabling studies with BMN 270. In addition, there will be increasing R&D investment in BMN 250 studies and in preparations for potentially bringing a new product into the clinic. Expenses in all of these programs should accelerate throughout the year. Furthermore, consistent with our experience after drug approvals, even though Brineura is now approved in the U.S. and potentially in the EU by the end of the quarter, there will still be R&D spending on this product while we seek regulatory and reimbursement approvals throughout our global territories and transition patient onto commercial therapy. Similarly, over 200 patients were made in pegvaliase extension studies as we prosecute regulatory approvals in both the U.S. and Europe. SG&A expenses increased to $120 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $105.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase primarily reflected the continued expansion of dividend as well as increased expenses related to ROW Kuvan sales to support of our global PKU franchise. With the launch of Brineura and early preparations for potential 2018 pegvaliase launch, we expect SG&A spending to also increase later in the year. Turning to bottom line results, we reported a $16 million GAAP net loss and $35 million non-GAAP net income in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a GAAP net loss of $83 million and a non-GAAP net loss of $29 million in the first quarter of 2016. Looking forward, due to the timing of the Brineura launch and the ramp up of our BMN 270 gene therapy and vosoritide programs, we expect an increase in both R&D and sales and marketing spending in the later quarters of the year, which will lead to increased quarterly GAAP losses and a decrease in non-GAAP income in the second consecutive quarters of 2017. Those spending will increase throughout the year as these development and commercial programs ramp up, we remain on track for full-year GAAP loss of $140 million to $180 million and non-GAAP income of between $30 million and $70 million. At the end of the quarter, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments totaling $1.2 billion compared to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2016. In closing, BioMarin delivered record results with robust sales from Vimizim, Naglazyme and Kuvan, resulting in reduced GAAP net losses and generating GAAP net income in the quarter. We expect the ramp up of our (19:27) pipeline products and the launch of Brineura to impact non-GAAP results in the second quarter with our 2017 non-GAAP expectation for the full-year is unchanged. Looking beyond 2017, we are driving for year-over-year revenue growth through the end of the decade and controlled operating expenses, which increased less than revenue and allows expanding operating margins and increased bottom line results. Now, I would like to open the call for questions and will ask the operator to open the lines. Question-and-Answer Session Operator And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask you about pegvaliase with the pending filing you have there. First of all, is it the same division of the FDA that just reviewed Brineura that's going to be looking at pegvaliase as well? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Cory. Yes, this is Hank. Same division, the Division of Gastrointestinal and Inborn Errors Products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, I mean at this stage of the game, I realized you're just kind of coming to focus a lot more in the coming months here, but what are your latest thoughts in terms of where you expect regulatory focus to be for this particular application? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. You're right. It's a little bit early to get into exactly where that's going to be. I think qualitatively, it's going to be in fairly similar places like it always is, safety, efficacy, overall benefit and risk. Now, the safety front has been well described. We've created a PEGylated enzyme that has a safety profile that's remarkably similar to our recombinant human products. Efficacy, we achieved Phe lowering in a very substantial portion of patients and only we'll be able to see an indirect evidence of a benefit on neurocognition. And I think the benefit risk concept has to be considered in the light of what's available alternative. And sadly, for so many patients in the PKU arena, there aren't very good alternatives. So medical food is unpalatable and unpleasant, has its own toxicities. And so, we hope that that will be the framework for evaluation during the review, but stay tuned for more considerations. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last thing, Hank, on this front, when you said you're looking to include, I think you said patient voice into the package. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you provide a little more color as to what that means? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, there are initiatives underway at Food and Drug Administration around patient-centered drug development and bringing patient's voice more in the process. You're familiar with us from the point of view of the open mic session at the Advisory Committees. You're also aware that the frequency of Advisory Committee is probably diminishing as time goes by and is less and less relevant in the rare and ultra-rare disease space. And so, we look for ways to, and so does the Agency, for ways to hear from patients in the development and regulatory process that helps make their interpretation of benefit risk most relevant to the patients, and to do that in a way that is more rich than simply the one hour in the Advisory Committee, which is diminishing in frequency. There are a variety of ways to do that. We have a lot of experience doing it, recently, gained a lot more experience doing that both in the U.S. and the EU with Brineura, and stay tuned for more specifics about that as the time draws closer. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, again, for taking the questions. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Question for Hank, on BMN 250, can you just run through the relationship again between heparan sulfate and neurocognition? And how you think about kind of the importance of some of the non-CNS disease burden going forward? And then just looking at the move from the 30 mg per week to the 300 mg dose, given the striking data that you saw at the lowest dose, what do you think the benefit is of moving to kind of a 10 times that high given that you're already seeing reductions in the biomark onto the normal range? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. So, heparan sulfate is one of the species of glycosaminoglycans that is not metabolized – tabolized, I should say, (24:39) correctly in the absence of this enzyme, NAGLU, and accumulates in brain cells. And its relationship to neurocognition impairments has really been best studied preclinically in the absence of clinical programs to document relationship between reductions in GAGs and improvements in neurocognitive outcomes. In animal species, what we have shown is that the direct delivery of the enzymes to the brain results in a reduction in measurable levels of heparan sulfate in brain tissues. And it's also accompanied by improvements in physiopathological evidence of neuronal cell health. And so, we think that the reduction by the delivery of the enzyme that's missing (25:36), the clearance of the storage product out of brain cells and the restoration of neural health will translate into resumption of normal cognitive development in MPS IIIB. As regards systemic or non-PNS or somatic manifestation of the disease, there is evidence of somatic impairment in MPS IIIB. Presently these morbidities are not as consequential for the patient as the CNS manifestations, and it's really the CNS manifestation that in today's world caused so much more morbidity. But one could imagine that if we have the same kind of effect on MPS IIIB that we have with that disease that there is the possibility that somatic manifestation for disease could become more pronounced. The modulator of that of course is just how much NAGLU gets into the periphery after an ICV delivery and MPS IIIB. And it's possible that some of the somatic manifestations may not develop, simply because there is some degree of enzyme delivered to the periphery. Stay tuned. It will take a while to learn more about that, and clearly, we'll learn more about that from the use of Brineura in CLN2 disease. And then finally, the rationale for going higher in dose on one level is the Phase 1 study to learn the tolerability of higher doses. And what we don't yet have evidence of about is the quantitative nature of the relationship between certain levels of GAG reductions and improvement in clinical outcomes. We'll be conducting some more preclinical experiments to better understand that. And as to what dose might be taking forward for commercialization, again, it's a little early to speculate about that so stay tuned. Hopefully (27:37). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Concise coverage (27:40). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No. No. That's great. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Next? Operator And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One commercial, then one pipeline. First, on the commercial, you did mention that there were some pull forward of the ordering patterns in Q1. Can you give us some sense of how that's likely to play out for the rest of the year? Is it all going to be felt in Q2 or is it more going to be spread over the subsequent quarters of the year? And then second, on pegvaliase, one for you, Hank. Could you remind us what prompted the FDA to require that the new immunology analysis, was it simply that a lot of time had passed since the trial or was there a more specific question that they informed you about? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Phil. Jeff here. I'll cover the first question. Wanted some evidence of forward buying, which is not unusual for these markets in Middle East, some markets in Asia, Latin America. Usually we don't see the impact of that all at once in the next quarter and we would quantify – as we've estimated that the impact on both Vimizim and Naglazyme to be a combined about $5 million to $10 million in the quarter. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good. Thanks. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And as to what prompted the Agency's request for additional analysis. It wasn't so much that it was driven by findings and discussions in the time before the BLA submission is driven more by the nature of the substance of the drug product. So to remind you PEG-PAL is phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a protein of non-human origin, which is pegylated to reduce the immunologic sequelae of developing an antibody response. The Agency, and it's earlier question we discussed, this is the same review division that is familiar with our Aldurazyme, our Naglazyme, our Vimizim. So, they are quite familiar with the immunologic responses to recombinant human products, but they are not quite as familiar with immunology, the response to a heavily pegylated bacterial product. So, we're talking about something somewhat new and recall also that some of our commentary about working with the DGIEP is that like other review division, they are stretched in for resources. So, knowing that the review time lines are going to be tight, it's really important for them to hit their PDUFA metrics. They have limited vehicles for extending submission reviews through major amendments. The agency requested that we provide as much of the immunology data upfront to facilitate their timely completion of their review. So, it was a negotiated agreement with the Agency about how much to give them in advance and how much to expect them to be undertaking as in process review. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Actually – okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding BMN 270, can you comment on steroid tapering or anything new need for steroid use and preliminary thoughts? Have you had any on the pivotal trial design? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, steroid, there is not really much of an update to give. I mean we'll cover this in a little bit more detail at ISTH. Just recall, the last update that we gave, I think the comment was everybody is off steroids, and everybody's liver function except for one patient, is down to normal and the one patient that wasn't already normal was at 45 with an upper limit of 43 or something like that. And so, there really is nothing new to report, and everybody is perking along and stay-tuned for a real update in the mid-year ISTH meeting. As regards the pivotal trial program, and I think there are sort of two poles of consideration. Clearly, one is, is that the potential for benefit is quite substantial in regard to reduction in bleeding episodes, reductions in Factor VIII use, improvement in quality of life related to reduced bleeding, reduced recombinant medications, potentially improved quality of life because of a reduction in bleeding frequency that is not treated as a bleed. For example, visceral bleeds are often not recognized as bleeds. So, there's quite a bit of desire to document that in a pivotal trial to support adoption and reimbursement. And we have every reason to believe given the data that we have obtained so far is that that's what will happen. At the same time, you've got an end point Factor VIII levels, which has got to be viewed as reasonably likely to predict a clinical outcome. And so that could offer an opportunity for an accelerated approval in the United States or conditional marketing authorization in Europe. And the virtue of that pathway is that it enables access to treatment faster than might otherwise be available if the product was approved under a standard approval mechanism. That's why they have accelerated conditional marketing authorizations in the U.S. and EU collectively. So, is it exactly what we settled on for the overall development program? TBD, but I think that's a little bit of color on how we're thinking about the opportunities there. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. And, Hank, just a follow-up here in MPS IIIB. When should we get the next update, and then any updated thoughts on patient epidemiology or the competitive landscape? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, on the competitive landscape front, pretty easy to say that the other folks are I think recognizing what we had recognized, which was direct brain delivery is probably a better idea than other approaches given the existence of a blood brain barrier and the need for relatively dramatic reductions. We are in the process of completing analysis of the patients in the dose escalation phase. We are busy enrolling more patients in the national history study, and ultimately, they'll flow into the treatment study. As to when the next update will be, I don't think we've penciled that out just yet, so stay tuned. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Another question on BMN 250, if you don't mind. So, Hank, I wonder if you could clarify – I know you said it's too early to talk about a final dose, but did you go directly from 30 milligrams to 300 milligrams or were there any interim steps in between? And then can you just clarify, is the expansion phase, they will all – the expansion phase – would that all be at the 300 milligram dose? And then finally on that, what's a reasonable timeframe to expect a neurocog result from that cohort? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So let's see, I'm going to do my best to remember the questions. So the patients were escalated from 30 milligram to 100 milligram to 300 milligram. So there was an intervening dose between 30 milligram and 300 milligram. And all of the patients in the expansion will start at 300 milligram together, the most information we can on the safety of high exposure and also the effects of higher doses on maintenance of GAG lowering. To remind you in the first three patients dosed at 30 milligrams, two out of three had heparan sulfate levels that moved into the normal range. And a third patient's CSF GAG levels moved into the normal arrangement to hover just above the normal range. So, we'd be very keen to see more data on longer term suppression of CSF GAG levels at the higher doses. Now, a timeframe on which to expect that update to be provided, I think again, is a little premature. Some of that has to do with the rate of enrollment in the natural history study. Some that has to do with the rate of transfer of patients from natural history into the drug study. So, it's really premature to speculate on when those data are available. I think also the nature of the question was when can we expect to see neurocog if there is a benefit. And the thing to say about that is that the primary outcome measure here is development. And if we see as good a result as we saw with Brineura, that might happen relatively quickly, but we don't know what magnitude of result we'll observe. So, that's also another complicating factor sort of estimating when there will be an update of relevance on NAGLU. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, that was actually my next question is, and maybe one that you're not ready to answer is, are there brackets around the magnitude that you'd need to see, at least in terms of what FDA is looking for or what you think you'd need in terms of neurocog benefit? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Well, what I can say is that we think that relatively low order magnitude reductions in CSF GAGs are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. And we based that on animal data that I referenced earlier in which you can't really impact neuronal cell health until you get to substantially more marked degrees of CSF GAG reduction. And we also partly based that on more intermediate impacts on CSF GAGs in MPS II and MPS IIIA, which were not accompanied by overt clinical benefits in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy delivered via lumbar intrathecal delivery. So, we think that you've got to push GAG levels down pretty far if not as far as you possibly can to achieve the dramatic effect that we like to see. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz from Leerink Partners. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us understand when we're likely to get the performance of the patients that are getting BMN 270 at the 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, as I said in my prepared comments, based on the observations that me and others have made, it takes about 14 to 26 weeks after gene transfer for liver expression to stabilize. And based on the timing of the doses that were given, we expect the data on 4 x 1013 vg/kg later this year. Now, I think what people are going to try to resolve to is what expectation to have for the ISTH update if the data are not there, what does it mean? It probably would only mean – and I'm saying this because we haven't arrived at any point of stabilization, because the presentation of data will be informed by whether it's officially mature yet as opposed to whether it's too early to make these data available. I would say and just remind people that with those patients, first three patients, we wait a little while before deciding whether to dose the next three patients with the same or higher dose. We dosed the next three patients at that same – what we're calling the mid-dose or 4 x 1013 vg/kg. And you can interpret that was because we're pretty enthusiastic about what we were seeing among the first three patients. As to exact numbers and exactly what's going to get presented and when it's going to get presented, we need to leave a little room for allowing the data to mature, and we're just not there. I know we're eight weeks ahead of the event, but we're just not at the event yet. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC All right. Okay. And then on vosoritide, it sounds like you were modifying the randomized study, if that's right and then adding some ancillary studies. Can you explain some more about what's going on there? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, it was really more around modified ancillary studies. The trial is in rolling now, one year placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial continuing substantially unmodified as we talked about it in the past. The ancillary studies are a program of studies that we've talked about in the past. We've talked about the functionality, proportionality, final adult height and safety efficacy in infants and toddlers. And as has been our tradition in the past, we usually concentrate on getting the randomized study up and running first, and then we turn our attention to the ancillary studies for the simple reason that the randomized trials usually provide about definitive evidence and the ancillary trials if they require it all for registration are supported at best. And so, the commentary was simply that as regard to final adult heights, we're building more contemporaneous database that relates final adult height in achondroplasia and relates final adult height in achondroplasia to functional outcomes related to proportionality of the functional outcomes. So just giving a little bit more specifics about the objectives of that portion of the program and then a little bit more specifics around the infant and toddler study by saying that it's very important in providing additional evidence of growth benefit as well as potentially neurological benefit of introducing vosoritide. And those modifications for that portion of the program were being undertaken. Now that we have so much more safety and efficacy data from doses in older children. So, again, the big picture is the vosoritide is progressing, randomized control trial underway, ancillary studies in support of decision making by payers by regulators and stay tuned for more updates as those studies get more completely finalized. Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC All right, great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two follow-ups and I think they're more just clarifications. Hank, on vosoritide, can you just talk a little bit about the younger kids studies that you're going to start. I mean is there any dosing work that you need to do there and sort of what's the age range of patients that you were considering and then – or if you don't need it to dose (43:19) physicians to start something where they're going to look at growth velocity. And then, if you could just clarify, because you said a couple of things about BMN 270 data at ISTH. We will see data from 4 x 1013 vg/kg (43:33) cohort and it's just unclear about the scope and size of that data or is it possible that we won't see any data from that cohort? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we'll take the last part first. It's possible you won't see any data from the cohort. It is also possible that you'll see some data from that cohort and it's just too early even recognizing that it's not that far away from now. Just you want to let the data mature and we don't want to present something potentially misleading as it is maturing. So stay tuned and then we'll do our very best to get you relevant information just as soon as we have it. And then on BMN 111, I don't know that I can be more concretely definite than just as to your questions, we're excited to say more specific. We're evaluating the data that we have on exposure and age to determine if its substantially likely that we would need to have different doses in much younger children. And the age range that we would be considering is – in a randomized trial, you're eligible if you're older than five. But we recognized (44:45) diagnosed, oftentimes either before birth or at birth or shortly after birth, and that families will want to know, is it safe to start vosoritide or when is it safe start vosoritide. Especially given that the earlier you treat a genetic disease, the better your long-term outcome is. So we're scrubbing our safety exposure response data from our existing population. We're endeavoring to push, in partnership with health authorities and our clinician advisers to progressively younger and younger children to establish safety and potentially efficacy. And until that trial is up on clinicaltrials.gov, I think it would be too preliminary to speculate on the exact final clinical (45:34) study. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Just maybe a follow-up or two. On BMN 270, it seems like you and one of your gene therapy competitors might have data in Berlin. Hank, maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on as we all try to compare across trials, what we should be looking for? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The non-cheeky answer to that is going to be – well, it's going to sound cheeky no matter how I deliver it. It's going to be the fact – it's how much experience in time do the various assets have under their belt. When we first – I think the picture that we have of BMN 270 now at the year-plus mark is substantially different than where it was at say the half-year mark. I mean just to remind you at R&D Day last year, I think we were presenting that we had gotten an effective gene transfer to some patients, but we're also in the middle of dealing with some liver function test elevations and some regulatory interactions around those liver functions test elevations. And as you flash forward, you realize that all that had settled out and hardly any of that was relevant. So I think, with us positioned so far out in front of the competition, it's going to be a little hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons to seize the time differences the two programs have. I think the second thing is to just remind that, yeah, it can be very difficult in the best of circumstances can compare drugs that were not studied in the same study. And so I suspect that the followers will be talking about how great their evidence is that stacked up against our data. And I would just caution that that's hard to do in even the best of circumstances. Our focus will be on getting our BMN 270 across the finish line and that's what you're going to hear from us. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up question in regard to the potential pivotal design for BMN 270, I know you've mentioned annualized bleeding rates. You mentioned Factor VIII levels. Is it possible for you to just maybe opine on the size of those studies and potential duration of a follow-up that the FDA might require? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can opine on practically anything. So I think you see the stabilization in Factor VIII levels, 14 to 26 weeks, the question I think the health authorities will ask is, is that long enough to be sure that levels aren't going to go dramatically up after that period or dramatically down after that period, but I think you can get a sense of a dramatic effect on Factor VIII expressions in half a year. On bleeding, there have been clinical trials that have led to approvals of products with the half a year of data. My suspicion is that in gene therapy on an important clinical outcome like bleeding, health authorities are going to want to see more than half a year of data on bleeding rate. I think the bigger difference between the two pathways is likely to be sample size. When you can correct the gene expression from less than 1% to in the normal range, it's not going to take a lot of patient sample to document that. If that's going to take a lot of sample sizes to document an 91% reduction in bleeding frequency either although that number could end up being a little bit bigger than the Factor VIII number simply because of the trial design considerations. So stay tuned. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And one question for J.J., if I may. What are the plans for the pediatric review voucher? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We haven't really decided at this time. A lot of the products we have in development actually would themselves be getting priority review. You don't know this time is pegvaliase will get priority review. So it will be in the equation but that's not the only thing. So, we might look at divesting this voucher, but again, we haven't made any final decision. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with the first one back to PEG-PAL and kind of anymore consensus about measuring neurocog or anything maybe on the more quantitative side that you can include in the package? And then I have a couple others. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Alethia. I think we've came to the pretty comprehensive story already about what we know about neurocognition which to just remind you is that there is pretty heterogeneous phenotype of cognitive impairment in PKU patients. The predominant form of impairment is inattentiveness, but there are also other neurocognitive manifestations. Some of those include mood disorders like anxiety and depression, but some of those also include dimensions of neurological health like executive function, judgment ability, et cetera. We concentrated on the inattentiveness in the previously conducted pivotal trial for the simple reason that was the most prevalent of the forms. We documented that the neurocognitive impairment in phenylketonuria in adults is not irreversible, but for reasons we don't completely understand, we were unable to document improvement in neurocognitive outcome in patients randomized to withdraw from pegvaliase compared to patients who were maintained on the pegvaliase after achieving a steady pegvaliase dose. That may pertain to the tools and that may pertain to the timeframe. So, we also demonstrated some trends in some of the more quantitative aspects of executive function, specifically computer sets, the tests of processing speed, as an example. We referred to that as CANTAB in our previous communication. And we're working with experts and agency to identify what could be used in a post-approval trial should that be warranted. And I want to remind you from my prepared comments that no definitive path has been determined for the application or for the approval. We are working in parallel with the agency anticipating and wanting to be ready for whatever post-approval commitments come our way. And so we're examining these issues very carefully and closely right now. We haven't settled on exactly what to do next in regard to measuring neurocog in PKU patients. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. And so on the gene therapy manufacturing facility, I know you talked about mid-year as kind of timeline. Is there anything else that kind of needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just kind of walk us through the what's next briefly at a time and last steps. And then the last question is probably for Jeff, around – can you talk about potential impact of Kuvan, of generics? Do you think it's like kind of a slope, or do you think it's a cliff and why do you think that thing? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So let's start with manufacturing. We got Robert Baffi, our Head of Technical Operations here on the line. So Robert, you want to answer that question on gene therapy manufacturing? Robert A. Baffi - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Sure J.J. Thank you. So where we are now with the facility is we've mechanically completed the facilities, that means all the major pieces of equipment have been installed. We go through a commissioning phase which will take approximately two to three months to make sure all equipment is appropriately validated and operational. And then we'll go into production starting in the late part of the third quarter, and eventually, as we produce and characterize that material, we will have to file that facility as with the Agency and that's the main reasons why the timing for bill of material goes into the second quarter of 2018. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Robert. Now Jeff to answer the question on generics? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So Alethia, I think you're referring to what would our expectations be in the U.S. market to... Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That's right. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ... the generic entry. And I think that we know very well how to characterize the generic entry for a traditional retail type of pharmaceutical. It's less clear what to expect in the case of Kuvan, because of our unique business model, and because there's not really very many, if any, good analogs to follow of specialty products with closed-loop distribution systems facing generic entry. So anything we have to offer on this one is speculation, but some of the things that we're thinking about are the traditional methods by which generics get rapid penetration and displace the reference brand may not apply here. We may have some advantages favoring Kuvan, based not only on the distribution model, but our relationship with prescribers and patients. And also, we are not underestimating the ability of a generic competitor to find cracks in the model. So, can't provide very specific guidance to you other than saying we don't think it's going to be exactly a traditional cliff like with a standard retail pharmaceutical. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. I also want to add that. I mean, of course, it was going to be depend whether or not pegvaliase (56:27) October 2020 in the U.S. and the extent to which some Kuvan adult patients moved to pegvaliase in the U.S. And also, I just want to remind you that the October 2020 date is only I guess the U.S. market. And for Europe, we think we have market protection until 2024. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ying Huang from BoA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for BMN 270 regulatory path here. Can you clarify whether you have had a meeting or you will schedule a meeting with FDA before you start the potentially pivotal Phase 2b trial? And then under which conditions do you think FDA would deem that trial pivotal? Secondly, maybe for Hank again. You are now assessing the proportionality in the Phase 3 trial for vosoritide but how important is that end point in the regulatory's eyes when you apply for approval pending the positive Phase 3 trial? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. How important is I guess... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (57:38) and the risk and the regulatory landscape (57:41). Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So I mentioned that we've had completed one round of interactions between EMA and the FDA. So hopefully that answers have we met with the FDA. And as to the path between now and the initiation of the Phase 2b study or the next study, and further FDA interactions, I probably won't give more specific comments about that until we're closer to the initiation of the clinical trial. Your question about what would be the basis for approval? I think it was, of the next trial that we do and as I laid out, that could be – if that trial is a factoring endpoint, it could lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in Europe. If that end point ends up being bleeding rate, that could lead to a full approval in both territories and exactly what mix and what approach we take, we're still in the process of harmonizing the feedback that we've obtained from the different regions. So a fairly normal phase or the process of pivoting from proof-of-concept into registration-enabling trials where we want to get the heaven of the best possible data to support adoption and reimbursement and the fastest regulatory action, so we can get started selling the product to patients. Now, switching the gears and talking about proportionality. The importance of proportionality, I think, is that it's something that defines achondroplasia different than growth hormone deficiency and represents an additional source of morbidity. It is less clearly understood than growth velocity as an outcome variable in statural disorders than proportionality is, but it could be relevant to substantiate that there is benefit for treatment beyond just growing faster. It could be that improving growth improves proportionality, improving growth and proportionality improves functional outcomes. And therefore that could be part of the story of how vosoritide gets approved at the end of the day. Now we're still collecting and doing trials and collecting data, so it's premature to speculate on what the outcomes of those trials will be, what significant regulatory review of those trial results is going to be taken for all of that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Martin Auster from UBS. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the BMN 270 manufacturing discussion that was laid out a little bit earlier. You spoke of a roughly nine-month timeframe between product production in Q3 of 2017 until Q2 2018 when the product from the new manufacturing facility could be introduced into the study. I just wanted to confirm that you intend to use the commercial produced product into the registration study? And also kind of, if you can comment on kind of your confidence level around that roughly nine-month timeframe and any key gating steps in that process? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. I'll start and then again, Hank and Robert can provide their perspective. It says on the big picture plan here when we said we anticipate starting the single trial (01:01:59) in Q3 at the time. And of course based on the timelines for the new facility, when we start that trial, we cannot use material from the new facility yet. So the plan in that case is to use material from a supplier that's used for the same process as the one we intend to use in the new facility but at a different scale, and it would be a larger scale in the new facility. Now, our intent is that to start sourcing, the product can be used in the field trial in the spring of next year from the new facility, and at the same time, anticipate to show comparability between the material provided from the current supplier and the new facility material. Should we be unable to show comparability between the two materials, then our current plan would be just to extend the field trials so as to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the new facility to still get approval with just patients treated from the new facility which will be the commercial scale and commercial process. Let's get out the big picture. Hank, do you want to add anything to that for Robert? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so one thing I would add – that's exactly the right description. You can think about what factors would cause an agency to be concerned about scale up and what factors would cause them to be unconcerned. So the better our comparability data, the less concerned they'll be and more willing they might be to accept the pooling of data from the two different sources. And then another aspect of consideration will be what's the relative benefit? And I think you can tell from the fact that we've received prime designation from the EMA, that there's a clearly clear recognition that the potential benefit of gene therapy is huge. So I think our view is, is that that's a reason to believe that we might be able to pool the results from studies of teams of the smaller scale same process with larger scale same process, but as J.J. laid out, stay tuned for how that action turns out. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on BMN 270. So Hank, I know you've had some preliminary regulatory discussions but I was just curious if you had any thoughts on there being any major differences and how the U.S. versus EU versus Japan, for example, the attitudes on risk benefit for BMN 270 and maybe some of the goal post that they would look for on the safety side, are there subtle differences that you'd expect or can you use the single trial across the globe to support approval? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, I think you just put your finger on the pulse of it. In the rare disease space, I think (1:04:38) has recognized the challenge of having region-specific trials. And part of the prime process is for them to be able to touch all the different corners of their process as early in the process as possible to facilitate that harmonization between the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Japan, we don't have as much experience with gene therapy just yet. So, my comments will be confined with the EMA and the FDA. My expectation is that the differences will be more subtle than they are major, but having this in the details and again you have to stay tuned to see how we're going to harmonize those various details. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Raju Prasad from William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. Hank, we've spoken to the few KOLs that showed a little bit concern on factor levels above 125%. Is that something that came up in regulatory discussions that you've had? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think the important thing to remember is just that we have a trial that allowed us to treat patients with that 5 x 1013 vg/kg dose that produced for one patient who's factor levels were above the upper limit normal. I'm not sure I know where the famous 125% or 120% (01:06:11). I mean that value is in the normal range. So I'm not sure where that concern emanated from. What we've said is that one out of our seven high-dose patients had stabilized around 250% and the remainder are below that upper limit of normal. So we've talked about what the ethno-immunologic evidence for how to evaluate the consequence that are and have characterized that as being fairly negligible. Having said that, we don't expect that every KOL is going to have the same opinion of the data on being number one and that it will take more and sample size longer-term follow-up to accumulate more data that will ultimately bring all prescribers into – or as many as possible into the viewfinder for prescribers as – prescribers of gene therapy. So we're pretty comfortable with the outcome of program so far from a health authority perspective. Stay tuned for more details about the program. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is in the context, if I may add, of where we stand now is – or the patients that have been treated with a high dose where we indeed had one patient that was above 150% which is upper limit (01:07:42). That's why we real puzzled by this 125% because as Hank said it is still within normal range, so we know where it comes from. Just in the context of patients that have not had any (01:07:54) or any need for recombinant Factor VIII infusion since July of last year. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then just a quick one, the manufacturing facility. Can you give some more color on the capacity days we have as far as – will you guys be able to produce other vectors aside from the ones you used for BMN 270? I just asked this because I think J.J. you've mentioned potentially disclosing another gene therapy candidate this year. Is that still the plan? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. As to next IND candidates, we tend not to talk about them until we talk about them and we haven't talk about them. We said, we recognized, we have a leadership position in gene therapy that might predispose us. And at the same time, there are other potentially very large orphans that could be of interest to BioMarin. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, we – seen another way, our gene therapies would probably be an important component of our future. At this time we don't really have any intention to turn into a pure gene therapy company. And we have internal research efforts and also business development efforts that also could potentially and likely will identify non-generic gene therapy solution to some rare and ultra-rare disorders that have no available therapy today. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks for the question. Operator And our next question comes from Jing He from Gabelli. Jing He - G.research LLC Thanks of taking the question. So on BMN 270, would you expect to have enough data from 4 x 1013 before starting Phase 2b. Should we expect an update on Q3? And also on Brineura, it's early days but just wondering if you've got any feedback from payers, especially on pricing. Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I'm just wondering, are we going to have some data I think that's what I heard on the 4 x 1013 addition before making a decision on the final design of the pivotal trial? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Of course. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, we will and we have an ongoing study of 4 x 1013. We have dosed 70 patients at 6 x 1013. As to whether that's sufficient or we need more dose finding, TBD. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And on your second question, the launch of Brineura just got under way, essentially this week. We've announced the price. We have some patients that are commercially in motion. We don't have any response yet from payers. Jing He - G.research LLC Great. Thanks. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for question. I will now turn the call back over to CEO and Chairman, J.J. Bienaimé for closing remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. So in summary, we start 2017 from a position of strength. We've been delivering a record quarter of $304 million in total BioMarin revenues. We've seen a 28% growth year-over-year. We got out sixth product approved, Brineura by the U.S. FDA. And it's in the process of being introduced probably at the beginning of June and potentially soon thereafter in Europe. Of course, upon a anticipated positive opinion there in June. Regarding our gene therapy program, it's moving forward and towards a registration-enabling study. Our pegvaliase is on the horizon and on track for a late Q2 filing. And continuing enrollments of our vosoritide and BMN 250 programs is (01:11:49). And so we look forward to continued success out of our worldwide development organizations. And we thank you for your continuous support and for joining us on today's call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator And our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Wanted to ask you about pegvaliase with the pending filing you have there. First of all, is it the same division of the FDA that just reviewed Brineura that's going to be looking at pegvaliase as well? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Cory. Yes, this is Hank. Same division, the Division of Gastrointestinal and Inborn Errors Products. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, I mean at this stage of the game, I realized you're just kind of coming to focus a lot more in the coming months here, but what are your latest thoughts in terms of where you expect regulatory focus to be for this particular application? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. You're right. It's a little bit early to get into exactly where that's going to be. I think qualitatively, it's going to be in fairly similar places like it always is, safety, efficacy, overall benefit and risk. Now, the safety front has been well described. We've created a PEGylated enzyme that has a safety profile that's remarkably similar to our recombinant human products. Efficacy, we achieved Phe lowering in a very substantial portion of patients and only we'll be able to see an indirect evidence of a benefit on neurocognition. And I think the benefit risk concept has to be considered in the light of what's available alternative. And sadly, for so many patients in the PKU arena, there aren't very good alternatives. So medical food is unpalatable and unpleasant, has its own toxicities. And so, we hope that that will be the framework for evaluation during the review, but stay tuned for more considerations. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then last thing, Hank, on this front, when you said you're looking to include, I think you said patient voice into the package. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can you provide a little more color as to what that means? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, there are initiatives underway at Food and Drug Administration around patient-centered drug development and bringing patient's voice more in the process. You're familiar with us from the point of view of the open mic session at the Advisory Committees. You're also aware that the frequency of Advisory Committee is probably diminishing as time goes by and is less and less relevant in the rare and ultra-rare disease space. And so, we look for ways to, and so does the Agency, for ways to hear from patients in the development and regulatory process that helps make their interpretation of benefit risk most relevant to the patients, and to do that in a way that is more rich than simply the one hour in the Advisory Committee, which is diminishing in frequency. There are a variety of ways to do that. We have a lot of experience doing it, recently, gained a lot more experience doing that both in the U.S. and the EU with Brineura, and stay tuned for more specifics about that as the time draws closer. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thanks, again, for taking the questions. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters from Deutsche Bank. Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on all the progress. Question for Hank, on BMN 250, can you just run through the relationship again between heparan sulfate and neurocognition? And how you think about kind of the importance of some of the non-CNS disease burden going forward? And then just looking at the move from the 30 mg per week to the 300 mg dose, given the striking data that you saw at the lowest dose, what do you think the benefit is of moving to kind of a 10 times that high given that you're already seeing reductions in the biomark onto the normal range? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. So, heparan sulfate is one of the species of glycosaminoglycans that is not metabolized – tabolized, I should say, (24:39) correctly in the absence of this enzyme, NAGLU, and accumulates in brain cells. And its relationship to neurocognition impairments has really been best studied preclinically in the absence of clinical programs to document relationship between reductions in GAGs and improvements in neurocognitive outcomes. In animal species, what we have shown is that the direct delivery of the enzymes to the brain results in a reduction in measurable levels of heparan sulfate in brain tissues. And it's also accompanied by improvements in physiopathological evidence of neuronal cell health. And so, we think that the reduction by the delivery of the enzyme that's missing (25:36), the clearance of the storage product out of brain cells and the restoration of neural health will translate into resumption of normal cognitive development in MPS IIIB. As regards systemic or non-PNS or somatic manifestation of the disease, there is evidence of somatic impairment in MPS IIIB. Presently these morbidities are not as consequential for the patient as the CNS manifestations, and it's really the CNS manifestation that in today's world caused so much more morbidity. But one could imagine that if we have the same kind of effect on MPS IIIB that we have with that disease that there is the possibility that somatic manifestation for disease could become more pronounced. The modulator of that of course is just how much NAGLU gets into the periphery after an ICV delivery and MPS IIIB. And it's possible that some of the somatic manifestations may not develop, simply because there is some degree of enzyme delivered to the periphery. Stay tuned. It will take a while to learn more about that, and clearly, we'll learn more about that from the use of Brineura in CLN2 disease. And then finally, the rationale for going higher in dose on one level is the Phase 1 study to learn the tolerability of higher doses. And what we don't yet have evidence of about is the quantitative nature of the relationship between certain levels of GAG reductions and improvement in clinical outcomes. We'll be conducting some more preclinical experiments to better understand that. And as to what dose might be taking forward for commercialization, again, it's a little early to speculate about that so stay tuned. Hopefully (27:37). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Concise coverage (27:40). Andrew Peters - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. No. No. That's great. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Next? Operator And our next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen & Co. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. One commercial, then one pipeline. First, on the commercial, you did mention that there were some pull forward of the ordering patterns in Q1. Can you give us some sense of how that's likely to play out for the rest of the year? Is it all going to be felt in Q2 or is it more going to be spread over the subsequent quarters of the year? And then second, on pegvaliase, one for you, Hank. Could you remind us what prompted the FDA to require that the new immunology analysis, was it simply that a lot of time had passed since the trial or was there a more specific question that they informed you about? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Phil. Jeff here. I'll cover the first question. Wanted some evidence of forward buying, which is not unusual for these markets in Middle East, some markets in Asia, Latin America. Usually we don't see the impact of that all at once in the next quarter and we would quantify – as we've estimated that the impact on both Vimizim and Naglazyme to be a combined about $5 million to $10 million in the quarter. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good. Thanks. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And as to what prompted the Agency's request for additional analysis. It wasn't so much that it was driven by findings and discussions in the time before the BLA submission is driven more by the nature of the substance of the drug product. So to remind you PEG-PAL is phenylalanine ammonia lyase, which is a protein of non-human origin, which is pegylated to reduce the immunologic sequelae of developing an antibody response. The Agency, and it's earlier question we discussed, this is the same review division that is familiar with our Aldurazyme, our Naglazyme, our Vimizim. So, they are quite familiar with the immunologic responses to recombinant human products, but they are not quite as familiar with immunology, the response to a heavily pegylated bacterial product. So, we're talking about something somewhat new and recall also that some of our commentary about working with the DGIEP is that like other review division, they are stretched in for resources. So, knowing that the review time lines are going to be tight, it's really important for them to hit their PDUFA metrics. They have limited vehicles for extending submission reviews through major amendments. The agency requested that we provide as much of the immunology data upfront to facilitate their timely completion of their review. So, it was a negotiated agreement with the Agency about how much to give them in advance and how much to expect them to be undertaking as in process review. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Actually – okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks again for taking my questions. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Sure. Operator And our next question comes from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding BMN 270, can you comment on steroid tapering or anything new need for steroid use and preliminary thoughts? Have you had any on the pivotal trial design? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, steroid, there is not really much of an update to give. I mean we'll cover this in a little bit more detail at ISTH. Just recall, the last update that we gave, I think the comment was everybody is off steroids, and everybody's liver function except for one patient, is down to normal and the one patient that wasn't already normal was at 45 with an upper limit of 43 or something like that. And so, there really is nothing new to report, and everybody is perking along and stay-tuned for a real update in the mid-year ISTH meeting. As regards the pivotal trial program, and I think there are sort of two poles of consideration. Clearly, one is, is that the potential for benefit is quite substantial in regard to reduction in bleeding episodes, reductions in Factor VIII use, improvement in quality of life related to reduced bleeding, reduced recombinant medications, potentially improved quality of life because of a reduction in bleeding frequency that is not treated as a bleed. For example, visceral bleeds are often not recognized as bleeds. So, there's quite a bit of desire to document that in a pivotal trial to support adoption and reimbursement. And we have every reason to believe given the data that we have obtained so far is that that's what will happen. At the same time, you've got an end point Factor VIII levels, which has got to be viewed as reasonably likely to predict a clinical outcome. And so that could offer an opportunity for an accelerated approval in the United States or conditional marketing authorization in Europe. And the virtue of that pathway is that it enables access to treatment faster than might otherwise be available if the product was approved under a standard approval mechanism. That's why they have accelerated conditional marketing authorizations in the U.S. and EU collectively. So, is it exactly what we settled on for the overall development program? TBD, but I think that's a little bit of color on how we're thinking about the opportunities there. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. And, Hank, just a follow-up here in MPS IIIB. When should we get the next update, and then any updated thoughts on patient epidemiology or the competitive landscape? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, on the competitive landscape front, pretty easy to say that the other folks are I think recognizing what we had recognized, which was direct brain delivery is probably a better idea than other approaches given the existence of a blood brain barrier and the need for relatively dramatic reductions. We are in the process of completing analysis of the patients in the dose escalation phase. We are busy enrolling more patients in the national history study, and ultimately, they'll flow into the treatment study. As to when the next update will be, I don't think we've penciled that out just yet, so stay tuned. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Another question on BMN 250, if you don't mind. So, Hank, I wonder if you could clarify – I know you said it's too early to talk about a final dose, but did you go directly from 30 milligrams to 300 milligrams or were there any interim steps in between? And then can you just clarify, is the expansion phase, they will all – the expansion phase – would that all be at the 300 milligram dose? And then finally on that, what's a reasonable timeframe to expect a neurocog result from that cohort? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So let's see, I'm going to do my best to remember the questions. So the patients were escalated from 30 milligram to 100 milligram to 300 milligram. So there was an intervening dose between 30 milligram and 300 milligram. And all of the patients in the expansion will start at 300 milligram together, the most information we can on the safety of high exposure and also the effects of higher doses on maintenance of GAG lowering. To remind you in the first three patients dosed at 30 milligrams, two out of three had heparan sulfate levels that moved into the normal range. And a third patient's CSF GAG levels moved into the normal arrangement to hover just above the normal range. So, we'd be very keen to see more data on longer term suppression of CSF GAG levels at the higher doses. Now, a timeframe on which to expect that update to be provided, I think again, is a little premature. Some of that has to do with the rate of enrollment in the natural history study. Some that has to do with the rate of transfer of patients from natural history into the drug study. So, it's really premature to speculate on when those data are available. I think also the nature of the question was when can we expect to see neurocog if there is a benefit. And the thing to say about that is that the primary outcome measure here is development. And if we see as good a result as we saw with Brineura, that might happen relatively quickly, but we don't know what magnitude of result we'll observe. So, that's also another complicating factor sort of estimating when there will be an update of relevance on NAGLU. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, that was actually my next question is, and maybe one that you're not ready to answer is, are there brackets around the magnitude that you'd need to see, at least in terms of what FDA is looking for or what you think you'd need in terms of neurocog benefit? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Well, what I can say is that we think that relatively low order magnitude reductions in CSF GAGs are unlikely to be clinically beneficial. And we based that on animal data that I referenced earlier in which you can't really impact neuronal cell health until you get to substantially more marked degrees of CSF GAG reduction. And we also partly based that on more intermediate impacts on CSF GAGs in MPS II and MPS IIIA, which were not accompanied by overt clinical benefits in patients treated with enzyme replacement therapy delivered via lumbar intrathecal delivery. So, we think that you've got to push GAG levels down pretty far if not as far as you possibly can to achieve the dramatic effect that we like to see. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Joseph Schwartz from Leerink Partners. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC Great. Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could help us understand when we're likely to get the performance of the patients that are getting BMN 270 at the 4 x 1013 vg/kg dose? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, as I said in my prepared comments, based on the observations that me and others have made, it takes about 14 to 26 weeks after gene transfer for liver expression to stabilize. And based on the timing of the doses that were given, we expect the data on 4 x 1013 vg/kg later this year. Now, I think what people are going to try to resolve to is what expectation to have for the ISTH update if the data are not there, what does it mean? It probably would only mean – and I'm saying this because we haven't arrived at any point of stabilization, because the presentation of data will be informed by whether it's officially mature yet as opposed to whether it's too early to make these data available. I would say and just remind people that with those patients, first three patients, we wait a little while before deciding whether to dose the next three patients with the same or higher dose. We dosed the next three patients at that same – what we're calling the mid-dose or 4 x 1013 vg/kg. And you can interpret that was because we're pretty enthusiastic about what we were seeing among the first three patients. As to exact numbers and exactly what's going to get presented and when it's going to get presented, we need to leave a little room for allowing the data to mature, and we're just not there. I know we're eight weeks ahead of the event, but we're just not at the event yet. Joseph P. Schwartz - Leerink Partners LLC All right. Okay. And then on vosoritide, it sounds like you were modifying the randomized study, if that's right and then adding some ancillary studies. Can you explain some more about what's going on there? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, it was really more around modified ancillary studies. The trial is in rolling now, one year placebo controlled, randomized clinical trial continuing substantially unmodified as we talked about it in the past. The ancillary studies are a program of studies that we've talked about in the past. We've talked about the functionality, proportionality, final adult height and safety efficacy in infants and toddlers. And as has been our tradition in the past, we usually concentrate on getting the randomized study up and running first, and then we turn our attention to the ancillary studies for the simple reason that the randomized trials usually provide about definitive evidence and the ancillary trials if they require it all for registration are supported at best. And so, the commentary was simply that as regard to final adult heights, we're building more contemporaneous database that relates final adult height in achondroplasia and relates final adult height in achondroplasia to functional outcomes related to proportionality of the functional outcomes. So just giving a little bit more specifics about the objectives of that portion of the program and then a little bit more specifics around the infant and toddler study by saying that it's very important in providing additional evidence of growth benefit as well as potentially neurological benefit of introducing vosoritide. And those modifications for that portion of the program were being undertaken. Now that we have so much more safety and efficacy data from doses in older children. So, again, the big picture is the vosoritide is progressing, randomized control trial underway, ancillary studies in support of decision making by payers by regulators and stay tuned for more updates as those studies get more completely finalized. Operator And our next question comes from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC All right, great. Thanks for taking the question. I have two follow-ups and I think they're more just clarifications. Hank, on vosoritide, can you just talk a little bit about the younger kids studies that you're going to start. I mean is there any dosing work that you need to do there and sort of what's the age range of patients that you were considering and then – or if you don't need it to dose (43:19) physicians to start something where they're going to look at growth velocity. And then, if you could just clarify, because you said a couple of things about BMN 270 data at ISTH. We will see data from 4 x 1013 vg/kg (43:33) cohort and it's just unclear about the scope and size of that data or is it possible that we won't see any data from that cohort? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we'll take the last part first. It's possible you won't see any data from the cohort. It is also possible that you'll see some data from that cohort and it's just too early even recognizing that it's not that far away from now. Just you want to let the data mature and we don't want to present something potentially misleading as it is maturing. So stay tuned and then we'll do our very best to get you relevant information just as soon as we have it. And then on BMN 111, I don't know that I can be more concretely definite than just as to your questions, we're excited to say more specific. We're evaluating the data that we have on exposure and age to determine if its substantially likely that we would need to have different doses in much younger children. And the age range that we would be considering is – in a randomized trial, you're eligible if you're older than five. But we recognized (44:45) diagnosed, oftentimes either before birth or at birth or shortly after birth, and that families will want to know, is it safe to start vosoritide or when is it safe start vosoritide. Especially given that the earlier you treat a genetic disease, the better your long-term outcome is. So we're scrubbing our safety exposure response data from our existing population. We're endeavoring to push, in partnership with health authorities and our clinician advisers to progressively younger and younger children to establish safety and potentially efficacy. And until that trial is up on clinicaltrials.gov, I think it would be too preliminary to speculate on the exact final clinical (45:34) study. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Perfect. Thanks very much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Just maybe a follow-up or two. On BMN 270, it seems like you and one of your gene therapy competitors might have data in Berlin. Hank, maybe if you could just share with us your thoughts on as we all try to compare across trials, what we should be looking for? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The non-cheeky answer to that is going to be – well, it's going to sound cheeky no matter how I deliver it. It's going to be the fact – it's how much experience in time do the various assets have under their belt. When we first – I think the picture that we have of BMN 270 now at the year-plus mark is substantially different than where it was at say the half-year mark. I mean just to remind you at R&D Day last year, I think we were presenting that we had gotten an effective gene transfer to some patients, but we're also in the middle of dealing with some liver function test elevations and some regulatory interactions around those liver functions test elevations. And as you flash forward, you realize that all that had settled out and hardly any of that was relevant. So I think, with us positioned so far out in front of the competition, it's going to be a little hard to get apples-to-apples comparisons to seize the time differences the two programs have. I think the second thing is to just remind that, yeah, it can be very difficult in the best of circumstances can compare drugs that were not studied in the same study. And so I suspect that the followers will be talking about how great their evidence is that stacked up against our data. And I would just caution that that's hard to do in even the best of circumstances. Our focus will be on getting our BMN 270 across the finish line and that's what you're going to hear from us. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And if I may just ask a follow-up question in regard to the potential pivotal design for BMN 270, I know you've mentioned annualized bleeding rates. You mentioned Factor VIII levels. Is it possible for you to just maybe opine on the size of those studies and potential duration of a follow-up that the FDA might require? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can opine on practically anything. So I think you see the stabilization in Factor VIII levels, 14 to 26 weeks, the question I think the health authorities will ask is, is that long enough to be sure that levels aren't going to go dramatically up after that period or dramatically down after that period, but I think you can get a sense of a dramatic effect on Factor VIII expressions in half a year. On bleeding, there have been clinical trials that have led to approvals of products with the half a year of data. My suspicion is that in gene therapy on an important clinical outcome like bleeding, health authorities are going to want to see more than half a year of data on bleeding rate. I think the bigger difference between the two pathways is likely to be sample size. When you can correct the gene expression from less than 1% to in the normal range, it's not going to take a lot of patient sample to document that. If that's going to take a lot of sample sizes to document an 91% reduction in bleeding frequency either although that number could end up being a little bit bigger than the Factor VIII number simply because of the trial design considerations. So stay tuned. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. And one question for J.J., if I may. What are the plans for the pediatric review voucher? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We haven't really decided at this time. A lot of the products we have in development actually would themselves be getting priority review. You don't know this time is pegvaliase will get priority review. So it will be in the equation but that's not the only thing. So, we might look at divesting this voucher, but again, we haven't made any final decision. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I'll start with the first one back to PEG-PAL and kind of anymore consensus about measuring neurocog or anything maybe on the more quantitative side that you can include in the package? And then I have a couple others. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Alethia. I think we've came to the pretty comprehensive story already about what we know about neurocognition which to just remind you is that there is pretty heterogeneous phenotype of cognitive impairment in PKU patients. The predominant form of impairment is inattentiveness, but there are also other neurocognitive manifestations. Some of those include mood disorders like anxiety and depression, but some of those also include dimensions of neurological health like executive function, judgment ability, et cetera. We concentrated on the inattentiveness in the previously conducted pivotal trial for the simple reason that was the most prevalent of the forms. We documented that the neurocognitive impairment in phenylketonuria in adults is not irreversible, but for reasons we don't completely understand, we were unable to document improvement in neurocognitive outcome in patients randomized to withdraw from pegvaliase compared to patients who were maintained on the pegvaliase after achieving a steady pegvaliase dose. That may pertain to the tools and that may pertain to the timeframe. So, we also demonstrated some trends in some of the more quantitative aspects of executive function, specifically computer sets, the tests of processing speed, as an example. We referred to that as CANTAB in our previous communication. And we're working with experts and agency to identify what could be used in a post-approval trial should that be warranted. And I want to remind you from my prepared comments that no definitive path has been determined for the application or for the approval. We are working in parallel with the agency anticipating and wanting to be ready for whatever post-approval commitments come our way. And so we're examining these issues very carefully and closely right now. We haven't settled on exactly what to do next in regard to measuring neurocog in PKU patients. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. And so on the gene therapy manufacturing facility, I know you talked about mid-year as kind of timeline. Is there anything else that kind of needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint? Maybe just kind of walk us through the what's next briefly at a time and last steps. And then the last question is probably for Jeff, around – can you talk about potential impact of Kuvan, of generics? Do you think it's like kind of a slope, or do you think it's a cliff and why do you think that thing? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So let's start with manufacturing. We got Robert Baffi, our Head of Technical Operations here on the line. So Robert, you want to answer that question on gene therapy manufacturing? Robert A. Baffi - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Sure J.J. Thank you. So where we are now with the facility is we've mechanically completed the facilities, that means all the major pieces of equipment have been installed. We go through a commissioning phase which will take approximately two to three months to make sure all equipment is appropriately validated and operational. And then we'll go into production starting in the late part of the third quarter, and eventually, as we produce and characterize that material, we will have to file that facility as with the Agency and that's the main reasons why the timing for bill of material goes into the second quarter of 2018. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Robert. Now Jeff to answer the question on generics? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So Alethia, I think you're referring to what would our expectations be in the U.S. market to... Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC That's right. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ... the generic entry. And I think that we know very well how to characterize the generic entry for a traditional retail type of pharmaceutical. It's less clear what to expect in the case of Kuvan, because of our unique business model, and because there's not really very many, if any, good analogs to follow of specialty products with closed-loop distribution systems facing generic entry. So anything we have to offer on this one is speculation, but some of the things that we're thinking about are the traditional methods by which generics get rapid penetration and displace the reference brand may not apply here. We may have some advantages favoring Kuvan, based not only on the distribution model, but our relationship with prescribers and patients. And also, we are not underestimating the ability of a generic competitor to find cracks in the model. So, can't provide very specific guidance to you other than saying we don't think it's going to be exactly a traditional cliff like with a standard retail pharmaceutical. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. I also want to add that. I mean, of course, it was going to be depend whether or not pegvaliase (56:27) October 2020 in the U.S. and the extent to which some Kuvan adult patients moved to pegvaliase in the U.S. And also, I just want to remind you that the October 2020 date is only I guess the U.S. market. And for Europe, we think we have market protection until 2024. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Ying Huang from BoA Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I have one for BMN 270 regulatory path here. Can you clarify whether you have had a meeting or you will schedule a meeting with FDA before you start the potentially pivotal Phase 2b trial? And then under which conditions do you think FDA would deem that trial pivotal? Secondly, maybe for Hank again. You are now assessing the proportionality in the Phase 3 trial for vosoritide but how important is that end point in the regulatory's eyes when you apply for approval pending the positive Phase 3 trial? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. How important is I guess... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. (57:38) and the risk and the regulatory landscape (57:41). Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So I mentioned that we've had completed one round of interactions between EMA and the FDA. So hopefully that answers have we met with the FDA. And as to the path between now and the initiation of the Phase 2b study or the next study, and further FDA interactions, I probably won't give more specific comments about that until we're closer to the initiation of the clinical trial. Your question about what would be the basis for approval? I think it was, of the next trial that we do and as I laid out, that could be – if that trial is a factoring endpoint, it could lead to an accelerated approval in the U.S., conditional marketing authorization in Europe. If that end point ends up being bleeding rate, that could lead to a full approval in both territories and exactly what mix and what approach we take, we're still in the process of harmonizing the feedback that we've obtained from the different regions. So a fairly normal phase or the process of pivoting from proof-of-concept into registration-enabling trials where we want to get the heaven of the best possible data to support adoption and reimbursement and the fastest regulatory action, so we can get started selling the product to patients. Now, switching the gears and talking about proportionality. The importance of proportionality, I think, is that it's something that defines achondroplasia different than growth hormone deficiency and represents an additional source of morbidity. It is less clearly understood than growth velocity as an outcome variable in statural disorders than proportionality is, but it could be relevant to substantiate that there is benefit for treatment beyond just growing faster. It could be that improving growth improves proportionality, improving growth and proportionality improves functional outcomes. And therefore that could be part of the story of how vosoritide gets approved at the end of the day. Now we're still collecting and doing trials and collecting data, so it's premature to speculate on what the outcomes of those trials will be, what significant regulatory review of those trial results is going to be taken for all of that. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Martin Auster from UBS. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a follow-up on the BMN 270 manufacturing discussion that was laid out a little bit earlier. You spoke of a roughly nine-month timeframe between product production in Q3 of 2017 until Q2 2018 when the product from the new manufacturing facility could be introduced into the study. I just wanted to confirm that you intend to use the commercial produced product into the registration study? And also kind of, if you can comment on kind of your confidence level around that roughly nine-month timeframe and any key gating steps in that process? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. I'll start and then again, Hank and Robert can provide their perspective. It says on the big picture plan here when we said we anticipate starting the single trial (01:01:59) in Q3 at the time. And of course based on the timelines for the new facility, when we start that trial, we cannot use material from the new facility yet. So the plan in that case is to use material from a supplier that's used for the same process as the one we intend to use in the new facility but at a different scale, and it would be a larger scale in the new facility. Now, our intent is that to start sourcing, the product can be used in the field trial in the spring of next year from the new facility, and at the same time, anticipate to show comparability between the material provided from the current supplier and the new facility material. Should we be unable to show comparability between the two materials, then our current plan would be just to extend the field trials so as to enroll a sufficient number of patients from the new facility to still get approval with just patients treated from the new facility which will be the commercial scale and commercial process. Let's get out the big picture. Hank, do you want to add anything to that for Robert? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so one thing I would add – that's exactly the right description. You can think about what factors would cause an agency to be concerned about scale up and what factors would cause them to be unconcerned. So the better our comparability data, the less concerned they'll be and more willing they might be to accept the pooling of data from the two different sources. And then another aspect of consideration will be what's the relative benefit? And I think you can tell from the fact that we've received prime designation from the EMA, that there's a clearly clear recognition that the potential benefit of gene therapy is huge. So I think our view is, is that that's a reason to believe that we might be able to pool the results from studies of teams of the smaller scale same process with larger scale same process, but as J.J. laid out, stay tuned for how that action turns out. Martin Auster - UBS Securities LLC Okay. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Operator Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Afternoon guys. Thanks for the question. You had another one on BMN 270. So Hank, I know you've had some preliminary regulatory discussions but I was just curious if you had any thoughts on there being any major differences and how the U.S. versus EU versus Japan, for example, the attitudes on risk benefit for BMN 270 and maybe some of the goal post that they would look for on the safety side, are there subtle differences that you'd expect or can you use the single trial across the globe to support approval? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, I think you just put your finger on the pulse of it. In the rare disease space, I think (1:04:38) has recognized the challenge of having region-specific trials. And part of the prime process is for them to be able to touch all the different corners of their process as early in the process as possible to facilitate that harmonization between the European Medicines Agency and the Food and Drug Administration. Japan, we don't have as much experience with gene therapy just yet. So, my comments will be confined with the EMA and the FDA. My expectation is that the differences will be more subtle than they are major, but having this in the details and again you have to stay tuned to see how we're going to harmonize those various details. Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Raju Prasad from William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. Hank, we've spoken to the few KOLs that showed a little bit concern on factor levels above 125%. Is that something that came up in regulatory discussions that you've had? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think the important thing to remember is just that we have a trial that allowed us to treat patients with that 5 x 1013 vg/kg dose that produced for one patient who's factor levels were above the upper limit normal. I'm not sure I know where the famous 125% or 120% (01:06:11). I mean that value is in the normal range. So I'm not sure where that concern emanated from. What we've said is that one out of our seven high-dose patients had stabilized around 250% and the remainder are below that upper limit of normal. So we've talked about what the ethno-immunologic evidence for how to evaluate the consequence that are and have characterized that as being fairly negligible. Having said that, we don't expect that every KOL is going to have the same opinion of the data on being number one and that it will take more and sample size longer-term follow-up to accumulate more data that will ultimately bring all prescribers into – or as many as possible into the viewfinder for prescribers as – prescribers of gene therapy. So we're pretty comfortable with the outcome of program so far from a health authority perspective. Stay tuned for more details about the program. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is in the context, if I may add, of where we stand now is – or the patients that have been treated with a high dose where we indeed had one patient that was above 150% which is upper limit (01:07:42). That's why we real puzzled by this 125% because as Hank said it is still within normal range, so we know where it comes from. Just in the context of patients that have not had any (01:07:54) or any need for recombinant Factor VIII infusion since July of last year. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. And then just a quick one, the manufacturing facility. Can you give some more color on the capacity days we have as far as – will you guys be able to produce other vectors aside from the ones you used for BMN 270? I just asked this because I think J.J. you've mentioned potentially disclosing another gene therapy candidate this year. Is that still the plan? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. As to next IND candidates, we tend not to talk about them until we talk about them and we haven't talk about them. We said, we recognized, we have a leadership position in gene therapy that might predispose us. And at the same time, there are other potentially very large orphans that could be of interest to BioMarin. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, we – seen another way, our gene therapies would probably be an important component of our future. At this time we don't really have any intention to turn into a pure gene therapy company. And we have internal research efforts and also business development efforts that also could potentially and likely will identify non-generic gene therapy solution to some rare and ultra-rare disorders that have no available therapy today. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks for the question. Operator And our next question comes from Jing He from Gabelli. Jing He - G.research LLC Thanks of taking the question. So on BMN 270, would you expect to have enough data from 4 x 1013 before starting Phase 2b. Should we expect an update on Q3? And also on Brineura, it's early days but just wondering if you've got any feedback from payers, especially on pricing. Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I'm just wondering, are we going to have some data I think that's what I heard on the 4 x 1013 addition before making a decision on the final design of the pivotal trial? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Of course. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, we will and we have an ongoing study of 4 x 1013. We have dosed 70 patients at 6 x 1013. As to whether that's sufficient or we need more dose finding, TBD. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And on your second question, the launch of Brineura just got under way, essentially this week. We've announced the price. We have some patients that are commercially in motion. We don't have any response yet from payers. Jing He - G.research LLC Great. Thanks. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for question. I will now turn the call back over to CEO and Chairman, J.J. Bienaimé for closing remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator. So in summary, we start 2017 from a position of strength. We've been delivering a record quarter of $304 million in total BioMarin revenues. We've seen a 28% growth year-over-year. We got out sixth product approved, Brineura by the U.S. FDA. And it's in the process of being introduced probably at the beginning of June and potentially soon thereafter in Europe. Of course, upon a anticipated positive opinion there in June. Regarding our gene therapy program, it's moving forward and towards a registration-enabling study. Our pegvaliase is on the horizon and on track for a late Q2 filing. And continuing enrollments of our vosoritide and BMN 250 programs is (01:11:49). And so we look forward to continued success out of our worldwide development organizations. And we thank you for your continuous support and for joining us on today's call.

So with that, let me turn the call over to Mike. Michael Gregoire Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I am very pleased to report our strong fiscal fourth quarter performance. It was the best sales execution we’ve seen in our fourth quarter in well over a decade. There is no doubt we ended fiscal year 2017 with solid momentum. Our strong fourth quarter performance enabled us to deliver most metrics at the high end of our full year guidance ranges. In fiscal 2017, we achieved total revenue growth for the first time since fiscal 2012. Importantly, we did this while maintaining healthy operating margins and cash flow generation. Now we are positioning CA for our next phase, which we believe will accelerate our growth trajectory over time. Turning to our Q4 results. Our revenue, new sales, EPS and CFFO were at or above our expectations. The highlight was the strength we saw in new sales across both our Enterprise Solutions and our Mainframe segments. In ES, healthy new sales growth was broad-based and was particularly robust across API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery portfolio, with exceptionally strong results in our test data management business. In Mainframe, new sales grew meaningfully. It is not surprising that capacity sales declined from the year ago period given where we are in the hardware refresh cycle. But our Mainframe new sales performance in the quarter demonstrates how well customers are embracing our new innovations on the platform. In the quarter, strength in Mainframe new sales was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery or DCD, as well as Mainframe Operational Intelligence or MOI. Overall, our Q4 performance was driven by the great execution of our Platinum sales team. They did a very good job of capitalizing on a large renewal portfolio. Results from our North America Platinum and Public Sector teams were particularly strong. The renewal yield in the quarter was in the low 90s, inline with our longer term target, and new sales were up dramatically. Our Named and Growth, or partner-led sales organizations also delivered healthy double-digit new sales growth in the quarter. I am pleased to report that the integration of our Automic acquisition is progressing well. And, we enthusiastically welcome Veracode to the team. We are really excited about the quality of the products and most importantly the quality of the people at both Automic and Veracode. These strategically important acquisitions substantially strengthen the growing portion of our ES portfolio. For the full year, we delivered results broadly at the higher end of our guidance ranges. Revenue, EPS and CFFO were above the mid-point of the guidance ranges we provided for the full year. Operating margin came inline and reflects the absorption of acquisition related expenses associated with Automic and Veracode. Notably, for the full year, our ES revenue grew organically, which is a marked improvement over prior years. Our Mainframe segment delivered consistently solid performance through the year. For the year, Mainframe performed at the better end of our expectations. We believe our relative outperformance can be attributed to a few things. Our Mainframe business unit was an early adopter of the Agile methodology. This has resulted in the completion of nearly 40 releases in the past year with zero defects. This level of product quality is important to all customers, but is most important to our customers running mission critical applications. CA continues to invest meaningfully in the mainframe platform. We believe we offer a broader, more innovative, and cost competitive portfolio of solutions. We are also able to leverage our ES development as well as recent acquisitions to provide unique integrations and truly cross platform solutions that help customers solve complex challenges. Our broad, solutions-based portfolio enables us to provide customers with compelling, cost competitive offerings. For example, one of the largest retailers in the United States made the decision to partner with us to support its retail, corporate systems, credit cards and dotcom property. Our portfolio of innovative solutions is enabling them to simplify their IT environment, narrow their supplier base, and reduce their cost. In conjunction with our partners and our customers’ IT operations team, we are helping to deliver a seamless migration to seven key CA solutions in less than 90 days. Looking ahead, we believe our partnership with IBM on IBM Cloud Managed Services on z Systems, commonly referred to as zCloud, provides us with a great opportunity to help customers realize the benefit of the cloud while running mission critical, security rich mainframe workloads. This partnership enables CA to provide value to customers that have smaller MIPS consumption where the fixed costs of running a mainframe platform is challenging. It also gives the option to larger customers to move CapEx to OpEx by turning mainframe capacity into a service, similar to AWS or Azure. These dynamics have the potential to enable CA to capture incremental market segment share over time. When I look at our business overall, I can confidently say that we are in a good place. We are in a great businesses and we have absolutely improved our execution. In this industry, we can never rest on last quarter’s performance. But when I pause for a moment and look back at the work our teams have done, we have made outstanding progress. First and foremost, CA was recently named one of the World’s Most Ethical Companies in 2017 by Ethisphere Institute. This is the second year in a row that CA has received this honor, which recognizes companies that lead with integrity and align principles with action. We at CA take great pride in this recognition that we believe is a reflection of the culture and priorities we have cultivated over the last few years. I’m also pleased that our heightened focus on customer success is reflected in the significant improvement we’re seeing in our NPS or Net Promoter Score. This is a standardized measure of customers’ willingness to recommend our products to other potential customers. In fiscal 2017, our NPS scores across both our ES and Mainframe segments moved up considerably. The spirit of innovation within CA is alive and well. Throughout the organization, our teams understand that organic innovation is critical and is at the heart of our strategy. The budding success of our CA Accelerator, which is our internal VC like technology incubator, is certainly helping. In this framework, successful ideas become solutions and begin to build momentum with customers. The objective for these innovations is to exit the CA Accelerator into the product organization. The first graduate from the CA Accelerator to the CPO organization is a common analytics engine that can be utilized by both Mainframe and our Enterprise Solutions segment. Companywide, CA was granted 186 patents in FY '17, up from 157 in the prior year. Meanwhile, the product portfolio continues to improve. Our products are becoming easier to install, upgrade and manage. And we are pleased to report that our solutions continue to earn recognition from major industry analysts. For example, in Q4 CA was named a Leader by Gartner in its 2017 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Governance and Administration. We are listening to our customers. This is resulting in improved NPS scores, better products and more efficient business practices. We are furthering our commitment to deliver solutions in a way customers increasingly prefer to buy. We’re working to accelerate the velocity of products like Agile Central and Blazemeter. Looking ahead, we are optimizing our internal processes to build, sell, and monetize our subscription based products more systematically, with higher velocity and with greater efficiency. This includes building out a common set of best practices, metrics, and business architecture across our SaaS solutions. Similarly, we are optimizing the way in which we go to market. As mentioned last quarter, we’ve observed that our largest Named accounts have preferences and behaviors much like our Platinum customers. At the same time, the investments we’ve made in our partner channel and our digital sales over the past few years has started to gain momentum. This allows us to now reduce the complexity of our customer stratification. Going forward, we are migrating the Platinum, Named and Growth nomenclature towards two sales groups, Enterprise and Commercial. This aligns with our growing portfolio of next generation software solutions, and it aligns with how our existing and prospective customers transact. The Enterprise sales team will encompass what has been known as Platinum, in addition to the largest 30% or so of the Named sales group. We believe this will enable us to drive deeper penetration in our largest Fortune 2000 opportunities. The Commercial sales group will absorb the smaller Named customers and will be entirely served by digital sales and partners. We believe this will enable us to cost effectively serve a much broader set of potential customers globally. Ultimately, we expect this to propel a lower cost, higher velocity go to market strategy for CA over time. This is an exciting time at CA. This industry is moving quickly and so are we. We’ve made incredible progress and as we look toward the next phase of this company’s evolution, in many ways we are just getting started. As we enter FY'18 and beyond, we are pivoting to enter our next phase as a company that delivers sustainable, long-term growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Kieran to review our fourth quarter financials and full year guidance. Thank you. Kieran McGrath Thank you, Mike. Before we get started with the quarter review, please note that all comparisons are year-over-year and as reported, unless otherwise indicated. This afternoon I’m going to focus my comments on the key business drivers and performance indicators for the quarter. The balance of our financial details can be found in our supplemental and press release. As Mike had previously mentioned, we were very pleased with our sales execution in the fourth quarter. Q4 total new sales increased in the low 40s, while renewals increased in the low 50s. As we have stated on prior earnings calls, the year-over-year fluctuations in our renewal bookings vary on a quarterly basis, due to the timing and duration of large transactions. Automic contributed approximately mid-single digits to total new sales growth in the fourth quarter. Our Q4 renewal yield was in the low 90s, in line with our longer term expectations. In Q4, new sales in all regions were up as reported and in constant currency except EMEA, where new sales were flat as reported and up in constant currency, including the contribution from the Automic acquisition. Within our segments, Q4 Mainframe new sales increased in the low 40s, despite lower capacity sales which likely reflects the timing of the hardware cycle. Mainframe new sales performance was driven by organically developed products like Data Content Discovery and Mainframe Operational Intelligence. Q4 Enterprise Solutions new sales increased in the low 40s and mid 40s in constant currency. As Mike mentioned, the strong performance in this segment was driven by products like API Management, Agile Central, Security and our Continuous Delivery products, all of which saw meaningful improvement on a year-over-year basis. Automic contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth in the quarter. For the full year, total new sales were up approximately 10%, with Enterprise Solutions new sales up high single digits and Mainframe Solutions new sales up in the mid teens. Acquisitions contributed approximately high single digits to Enterprise Solutions new sales growth and mid-single digits to total new sales growth for the full year. Even without acquisitions, total new sales would have grown for the full year. Our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2017 was up in the mid-teens, and our renewal yield was in the low 90s in each of the four quarters. Total revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.01 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5% as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 2% as reported and down 1% in constant currency, and Services was down 6% as reported and down 5% in constant currency. Automic contributed 2 points as reported and 3 points in constant currency to total revenue growth in our fourth fiscal quarter. More specifically, Automic contributed approximately 6 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 4 points to Services revenue in the quarter. For the full year, total revenue was $4.04 billion, flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency. As a reminder, our fiscal 2017 results include one quarter of inorganic contribution from our 2016 acquisitions of Rally and Xceedium, in addition to our more recent acquisition of Automic. Fiscal 2017 Enterprise Solutions revenue was up 5%, Mainframe Solutions revenue was down 1%, and Services revenue was down 8% as reported and down 7% in constant currency. Acquisitions contributed approximately 2 points to total revenue growth for the full year. Acquisitions contributed approximately 3 points to Enterprise Solutions revenue growth and approximately 3 points to Services revenue for the full year. Total revenue backlog increased 11% as reported, and 12% in constant currency, while current revenue backlog increased 4% as reported, and 6% in constant currency, inclusive of Automic and Veracode. As we’ve said in the past, current revenue backlog will likely grow with more consistency as we demonstrate multiple quarters of new sales growth while maintaining a low 90s renewal yield. Fourth quarter GAAP operating margin was 21%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32%, in line with our expectations. Segment operating margins in the quarter were 59% for Mainframe Solutions and 1% for Enterprise Solutions. As typical, our Q4 margins were lower. In addition to higher seasonal expenses, an increased level of commissions paid from higher new sales generated in the period negatively impacted Mainframe Solutions segment operating margin in Q4. Enterprise solutions operating margins, which are typically seasonally lower in Q4, were also adversely impacted by non-recurring expenses related to our acquisitions of Automic and Veracode. In addition, segment margin was impacted by increased level of commission expense commensurate with new sales growth. Services margin was negative 3%. As we’ve discussed in the past, as our product portfolio has evolved and our solutions are becoming easier to install and to manage, fewer services are required. This has resulted in contraction of this structurally lower margin segment. Our fourth quarter segment margin reflects the continuation of our actions to better align the cost structure with our expected Services revenue run rate going forward. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates in the fourth quarter were approximately 21% and 25%, respectively. Q4 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.38, down 7%. Q4 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.54, down 10% as reported and down 12% in constant currency. For the full year, our GAAP operating margin was 28%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 37%. Fiscal 2017 segment operating margins were 61% for Mainframe Solutions, 11% for Enterprise Solutions, and breakeven for Services. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate for the full year was approximately 28%. GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fiscal year was $1.85, up 4% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the year was $2.48, up 2% as reported and up 1% in constant currency. Q4 CFFO was $419 million, down 11%. CFFO in the quarter was impacted by the GSA settlement. We paid $49 million inclusive of legal fees in the quarter, to settle a longstanding matter brought against us by the DOJ and an individual plaintiff relating to our GSA schedule with the government as previously announced. Single installment cash collections were $176 million in the quarter, up $46 million from the year-ago period. For the full year, CFFO was $1.04 billion, flat as reported and up 3% in constant currency. CFFO exceeded our expectations due to a higher level of single installment cash collections. Separately, we issued $850 million in investment grade bonds, primarily to fund our acquisition of Veracode. We issued a five-year $500 million tranche at 3.6% and a 10-year $350 million tranche at 4.7%. We are very pleased with the terms and are comfortable with the tenor of our corporate debt. We ended Q4 with approximately $157 million in net debt. During the quarter, we paid $107 million in dividends. Due to the acquisition of Veracode and the bond offering, we did not buy back stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. We expect to resume our share repurchases in the near-term with the intention to generally at least offset dilution. We have $650 million remaining of our original $750 million share repurchase authorization. Now, turning to guidance. Guidance is based upon exchange rates on the last day of the preceding quarter, which was March 31st, 2017. It includes the impact of the Veracode acquisition and includes the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of senior notes in March. No additional material acquisitions are assumed. For the full year, we expect total revenue to increase 2% to 3% as reported and to increase 3% to 4% in constant currency. This translates to reported revenue of $4.12 billion to $4.17 billion. This guidance contemplates our expectation that the overall mainframe market will decline in the low single digits over the medium term, consistent with what we’ve said in the past. We expect full year GAAP operating margin between 26% to 27% and full year non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. We expect our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be between 28% and 29%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 10% to 7% as reported, and to decrease 8% to 6% in constant currency. This translates to reported GAAP earnings per share of $1.67 to $1.72. This includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense associated with our March 2017 bond offering. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease 5% to 3% as reported and to decrease 4% to 2% in constant currency. This translates to reported Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.35 to $2.40. Again, this includes a $0.06 impact from the incremental interest expense from our bond offering, mentioned previously. At the end of the year, we expect approximately 412 million shares outstanding, and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 415 million shares. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in a range of down 2% to up 2%, both as reported and in constant currency. This translates to cash flow from operations of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion. The incremental interest expense from the bond offering impacts CFFO by approximately $33 million. Our cash flow from operations guidance includes our adoption of ASU 2016-09, titled Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting. The adoption of this standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 requires us to present taxes paid in connection with employee stock within cash flows from financing activities, rather than payments within cash flows from operations. The adoption of this accounting standard will be presented retrospectively and is not expected to impact the year-over-year percentage change. With regard to Q1, please keep in mind that we renewed a large system integrator in the June quarter of fiscal 2017. This creates a very difficult year-over-year compare that will be particularly evident in our Q1 renewal bookings and new sales. Additionally, the impact from the acquisitions and related integration expenses will be most impactful in the first two quarters of the year, particularly in Q1. For the full year, we expect the size of the portfolio to be renewed to be down in the high teens compared to the year ago period. Even excluding the impact of the large SI we renewed in Q1 last year, our renewal portfolio for fiscal 2018 is back-end loaded. We expect this to heavily influence the linearity of bookings throughout the year. To provide an update on ASC 606, the upcoming revenue recognition standard, as you will see in our 10-K filing tomorrow, we expect this change in the revenue recognition standard will have a material impact on our reported financial statements. Specifically, we expect that the point in time rather than ratable recognition of license revenue will increase the variability in our quarterly reported results. However, we do not expect that the change in standard will significantly impact the way in which we recognize revenue from maintenance, SaaS and professional services contracts. And we do not expect it will meaningfully impact customer billings or cash collections from customer billings. We are currently evaluating the effect of ASC 606 on cash tax payments. In general, we do not expect the economic value of our transactions to change as a result of ASC 606. We plan to adopt ASC 606 in our first quarter of fiscal 2019, and we are continuing to evaluate the transition method we will use. As we work through the changes coming with ASC 606, we are also exploring ways in which we can improve the transparency and simplicity of the metrics we provide on a regular basis to best reflect the ongoing performance of our business. In summary, we are pleased with our performance in Q4 where we met or exceeded our expectations across most financial metrics. As we look ahead to fiscal 2018 and beyond, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our long-term goal of sustainable growth. With that, we’ll open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is now open. Raimo Lenschow Two if I may. First of all, Mike, can you talk a little bit about when you see a new sales perform better than renewals. That’s my first and I have one quick follow up then. Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, thank you, Raimo. Actually for FY '17, if you exclude the mainframe capacity, new sales growth exceeded the growth in the renewal portfolio. And given our improved product portfolio, we believe new sales should be significantly better than the renewal portfolio this year in FY '18. I think that statement should be true on an organic basis as well. Raimo Lenschow Okay. Perfect. Really that sounds like you have turned a corner. And can I talk about the -- you mentioned the changes in the sales organization. I mean it's like enterprise commercial kind of seems to make a lot of sense. How much disruption should we get? Should we kind of expect from that or is it kind of all done and can you talk through that a little bit? Michael Gregoire Yes. I expect no disruption in it. The people who are covering accounts are covering the same accounts. We have moved some of the smaller accounts what we call commercial. And this has been something we have been working at for a couple of years as we have tried to improve the commercial segment. We finally felt coming out of Q3, Q4 performance that they were mature enough, had enough process and experience where they could service those customers. That coupled with the portfolio, as you know we have been rapidly moving towards more SaaS solution. Try and buy, lend and extend. Those solutions lend themselves well in those sales. And then strategically, as we know that our enterprise portfolio will relatively midterm, exceed the mainframe portfolio, we have to take into consideration our cost structure on sales and try to use a very expense sales force at a segment of the market that could easily be served by a broader sales force, is in the best interest for CA, both tactically and strategically. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Matt Hedberg Automic did a lot better than I think you guys had thought. I am curious, Mike, what drove that outperformance. Was it conservative assumptions or was it just a lot of broad net new sales that you saw in the quarter. Michael Gregoire Yes. I think it's a couple of things. First, a lot of net new [raw] [ph] sales couple with the fact it was their year-end, so their sales professionals have been working on deals and that all came together at the end of their quarter. And the secondly, customers that were evaluating multiple providers, the strength of the CA brand and ability to service customers on a global basis as well as the ability to link other products into their portfolio, gave then a strategic view into what the future could look like as they try to automate their whole infrastructure. So I think it was a combination of those three things that gave a little bit of up performance but I definitely want to hand off a lot of congratulations to the Automic team. They really went after the quarter with a lot of gusto. Matt Hedberg That’s helpful. Thank you. And then Kieran, I am curious on 606. It sounds like we will see more tomorrow. I am curious though, can you provide a little bit more color on potentially the impact to reported revenue. I guess the license component. Anything you can kind of help us out with a little bit more color on that. Kieran McGrath I think, Matt, it's a little premature on that for me to start giving specifics on it. But as you can well expect, we are a business that has been very primarily ratable, very small amount of upfront revenue, you can see that within the SFO accounts that we have. So converting the license content which is obviously quite material in both the ES and mainframe business. We will add volatility in any one given quarter. We think it's more than [indiscernible] over time. The length of time, maybe somewhat debatable but I think that’s what we are in the process of really sizing here. And what we are looking at -- are really looking for metrics that we will be able to add to the top line reported numbers to try and give a sense of the continuity in the business as we move through time. That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don’t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don’t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don’t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that’s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers? Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, first, we didn’t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together. We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well? Kieran McGrath Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that’s pretty clear evidence that we really didn’t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that’s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point. Michael Gregoire Is that helpful, John? John DiFucci Yes. That’s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy. Michael Gregoire Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that’s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half. Michael Gregoire Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question. Kieran McGrath Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that’s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits Two questions regarding acquisition. One, Mike, obviously this has been a very aggressive couple of years in terms of the dollar amount and [indiscernible]. 12 of the 300 million to 500 million bogie. So maybe if you could tell me how you are feeling at this point in terms of the -- next couple of years. Michael Gregoire Sure. Michael, you are breaking up a little bit. I think you are just saying how are we feeling now? Kieran McGrath I think you were asking about acquisitions, Michael. Michael Turits Yes. Sorry, headset malfunction there. Yes, acquisition were above, obviously $1.5 billion to $2 billion in last couple of years, above the $300 million to $500 million bogie, thoughts on the pace going forward? Michael Gregoire Sure. If I had my way in the world, what I would love to do is digest these acquisitions that we made. We are very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I have always preferred, given my choice to do smaller acquisitions, in the $50 million to $80 million range, that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products the scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engines. Unfortunately, we don’t get to chose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example. That was a two year quoting period and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode which we have been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in a relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity at properties like that, it's a price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don’t feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we would like the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I would like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in. Michael Turits Okay. And then you guys gave lots of help to us in terms of doing organic calculations. So really appreciate that. Just one, I don’t think you necessarily gave on the current revenue backlog which I believe is up 6% constant currency. Was that roughly five points from acquisition, because obviously that’s being going positive, something we are trying to closely monitor? Michael Gregoire Yes. So of the six points of constant currency, about half of it, three points was related to Veracode which as you know we closed on the absolute last day of the quarter and then Automic. And then the other portion, the other half was related to just the timing of the renewal portfolio that comes due here in fiscal '18, as well as the Q4 new sales. Michael Turits So you are saying it's three points only from acquisitions that’s inorganic in that’s six points. Michael Gregoire That’s correct. Michael Turits Okay. Thanks. I guess, if I squeeze one in. So does that feel though, I mean you said there is some timing. I mean this has been a big deal to talk about, one you felt like that was turning up in a sustainable way. So are those timing issues suggesting that that is not the turn or you think it might be? Michael Gregoire You know I like to hit it straight down the middle with you guys. When the number was flat or slightly negative, I kept reminding you that as the renewal portfolio, there was a lot up for renewal in fiscal '17, that that would influence, in a negative way, the current backlog and similarly as we have a lot of activity stretching out over time, it kind of goes the other way. All that said, I am very happy where we ended the quarter from a position perspective on the revenue backlog. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield on for Kirk. Two quick questions. Mike, can you provide just a bit more color on the improvement in sales execution this quarter and just kind of why you believe that can continue into FY '18? And then Kieran, can you just remind us of the assumed impact from Automic and Veracode on revenue guidance for FY '18? And are you going to call out the contribution from these deals individually going forward or just the total impact on revenue and profitability? Thanks. Michael Gregoire Well, with respect to sales execution, I think it comes down to having great products in a business model that sales professionals understand and a marketing team that has done a much much better job being able to articulate not only the strategy of our company and each one of our segments, but how the products work as a single product focus, as well as how those products work together. So when we are talking to customers, they might only want to buy one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous delivery, for example. You can buy just one product in continuous delivery but if you think about how you are going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovations and get up to market quickly, you can see as you are own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost, will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company. So we kind of call this whole package together. The software factory and as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company and we kind of fit the mould really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that’s really helping tell, a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the backlog question. Kieran McGrath Yes. So we are to report the acquisitions in total, as we always do. You will be give a clear view of what the acquisitive versus organic contribution is on both the new sales and a revenue perspective. Right now, we are giving guidance for three to four points for the year. We think the acquisitions are going to be roughly worth about 4 points. The reason I am hedging a little bit is I only closed Veracode on the 31 st . We have to do the valuation work and the whole of new impairment. While that work has to be done as we go through time, but we clearly call out the acquisitive nature in aggregate for both of those. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Abhey Lamba Good execution there. So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens. So are we modeling the new sales to grow on an organic basis in fiscal '18? Michael Gregoire Yes. I think when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sales then we had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand and coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of a new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single product companies, as we are starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product or solve one problem, they are trying to orchestrate a digital re-mastering of their business. And in order to do that, you are going to need multiple products, very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we are going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently. Kieran, maybe you would like to add to that based on some of the numbers you have been monitoring. Kieran McGrath So I guess, first of all, as you are probably aware, we don’t normally usually guide on new sales as we go forward. However, as Mike has been describing, we think about organic performance, ES revenue actually grew organically in fiscal '17 by two points. The mainframe was down a point. So overall our product revenue was actually flat in '17 with mainframe down a point, and ES up two points. So we look forward to time here. Obviously, we expect the mainframe market is declining in the low single digits to continue our planning at that level of planning, but we would expect to move to a time here that ES will continue to exhibit organic growth. Abhey Lamba Got it. Thanks, Kieran. Absolutely, that's very helpful. Thanks for the additional color. Kieran, you talked about the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption. Can you quantify the impact on your cash flows in your guidance? Thanks. Kieran McGrath No. Because we are going to actually doing it retrospectively, there will be no changes in the year to year. It's a relatively small amount to begin with but we are going to restate '17 and '18, so there won't be any impact on year to year. Abhey Lamba So what will your fiscal '17 cash flow be in that accounting method? Kieran McGrath Honestly, I don’t have it in front of me here right now. It's about $30 million. Yes. So my guys are telling me here, it's about $30 million. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard So I guess two questions. One similar to what Michael asked you on the revenue backlog. I think the billings backlog may have benefitted as well from the acquisition. Could you quantify what the impact was there from, I guess, Veracode and Automic. Kieran McGrath Right. So from an organic perspective, on the constant currency perspective in total, we are up 9%. The acquisitions contributed about two points to that 9%. Walter Pritchard And what about on the short-term? Kieran McGrath I am sorry, that was the short term number I was saying. The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions. Walter Pritchard Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there. Michael Gregoire Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected. Walter Pritchard Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx. Kieran McGrath So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that’s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run. Operator Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Michael Gregoire Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond.

That said, when we pull back and we take a look at our ability to bill our customers and collect the cash markup from this, we don’t see anything there. And quite frankly, we are not making changes to or contractual relationships to our customer. The customer is at the center of our business and we don’t think it's right to go and impact the customers with changes that are being driven by accounting. And from what we can see right now, we don’t think that true, fundamental economics are going to change although license in any given period will be more volatile. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Your line is now open. John DiFucci So guys, bookings were very strong. Even if you normalize for duration, I think bookings were up something in the double digits. Mike, you mentioned the strong renewals and strong lease sales and you also doubled the number of large deals. So I guess I have two questions. One, and I know your deals, like we try to model when they are supposed to renew. And I know that gets missed around a lot. So I am just curious, were there more deals that were signed early, more than normal. I know that happens every quarter. Did that happen this quarter? And then secondly, it sounds like your catching of new business to renewals is working really well and that’s great. So how is progress in signing new deals outside of a renewal cycle, whether it's with existing customers or new customers? Michael Gregoire Sure. Well, first, we didn’t naturally pull any deals forward in Q4, so that was pretty much standard practice, nothing outstanding or nothing special there. The new business inside the renewal, it's just a function of the quality of the products. I think we have almost everyone of our products either up in the Magic Quadrant or in the highest ranking of our top eight new focus products. So those products are very attractive to our customer and we have a sales team that intimately understands these customers, especially the large ones, John, as you all know, and having great products being sold in to, with those renewals. It was bigger than we probably anticipated but I would credit that with the quality of the products and the interesting nature of the solution that how the solutions work together. We also had uptick in volume in sales outside of the renewal portfolio. So more deals. But if you think about how the market is buying, it is try and buy, it is lend and expand. So you are going to see more transaction volume. I think it was the biggest transaction volume we have ever had for net new clients. The size of the transactions are relatively small compared to what we would sell into the renewal base. And I think over time, the lend and expand, those now are footprints for expand. Kieran, maybe you have a thought on that as well? Kieran McGrath Just one other point. So, John, if you recall, in prior quarters we had advised that we thought the renewal portfolio for this year was going to be up in the high teens. In fact, we kind of [indiscernible] rounding, we actually ended up in the mid-teens. So I think that’s pretty clear evidence that we really didn’t see any unnatural pull forward of any significant amount of deals that we hadn't been forecasting. So that’s clear. I think, Mike, you hit it right on the head, we are starting to see, especially with a lot of our SaaS businesses, we are seeing something like Blazemeter here, which is all done to digital sales. Just the volume is really exploding from that side of the business at once again is a very, relatively smaller price point. Michael Gregoire Is that helpful, John? John DiFucci Yes. That’s really helpful, guys. And just one, I guess follow up, Mike. So is that part of what's giving you the confidence, from the first question, from Raimo's question about the new sales this year is just volume of some of the try to buy, try before you buy or lend and expand type strategy. Michael Gregoire Yes. Of that end, we have put four products, net new organic products in the market that generated over $50 million in sales in relatively short period of time. I have four new SaaS products that come out in the next, that are all organically built. That is right in the confines of our strategy, making our portfolio work a little bit closer together. So it's a combination of good sales execution and really strong products that seems to be coming together for us. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Due to no response we will go to the next question. And our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Philip Winslow Obviously, you got a stronger quarter about new sales and renewals and I appreciate the commentary that you guys gave on the renewal portfolio. Just wanted to dig into those. First, Mike, just in terms of the renewal rates that’s you are seeing from a dollar perspective on the renewal side. Any sort of change, up or down, that you note there? And then also you mentioned that the renewals portfolio will be down this coming year and more backend loaded. I wonder if you can give us some more color in terms of just the waiting there for first half, second half. Michael Gregoire Sure. The renewal rate was pretty much the same that we have seen quarter-over-quarter. So no new changes there. Kieran has got his finger tightly on the pulse of the backlog and how the renewals are working, so I will let him answer that question. Kieran McGrath Sure. So as we think about, obviously we have our -- in the first quarter of this year, we have a pretty big difficult compare against a deal we had with an outsourcer in the first quarter of last year. So that’s going to really make the renewals on the new sales a very difficult compare in Q1. As we go through the rest of the year, I mean that starts to flatten out and even be up a little bit in the last part of the year. So for the whole of the year, as I said in my script, we are going to be down on a year-over-year basis in the high teens. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Michael Turits Two questions regarding acquisition. One, Mike, obviously this has been a very aggressive couple of years in terms of the dollar amount and [indiscernible]. 12 of the 300 million to 500 million bogie. So maybe if you could tell me how you are feeling at this point in terms of the -- next couple of years. Michael Gregoire Sure. Michael, you are breaking up a little bit. I think you are just saying how are we feeling now? Kieran McGrath I think you were asking about acquisitions, Michael. Michael Turits Yes. Sorry, headset malfunction there. Yes, acquisition were above, obviously $1.5 billion to $2 billion in last couple of years, above the $300 million to $500 million bogie, thoughts on the pace going forward? Michael Gregoire Sure. If I had my way in the world, what I would love to do is digest these acquisitions that we made. We are very excited about them. But as you know, acquisitions take work and I have always preferred, given my choice to do smaller acquisitions, in the $50 million to $80 million range, that have good base technology that needs organic engineering from us to get those products the scale and then put it through our marketing and distribution engines. Unfortunately, we don’t get to chose how these things work. If you take a look at Automic, for example. That was a two year quoting period and it finally came to conclusion. It just so happened that Veracode which we have been looking at for a long period of time, that happened in a relatively near time frame to Automic. Given my choice, I would have rather spread those out over time. But when you have an opportunity at properties like that, it's a price that we feel is right for value, you want to be able to execute. Now having said that, I think that our view on value is probably going to get a little tougher because we don’t feel we need to be out in the market. Now if something that was extraordinary was to come along, we would like the flexibility to go ahead and do that. But right now, I would like to digest what we have and just keep our eyes wide open for small tuck-ins that fit our strategy and hope that nothing material hits the market that we are really interested in. Michael Turits Okay. And then you guys gave lots of help to us in terms of doing organic calculations. So really appreciate that. Just one, I don’t think you necessarily gave on the current revenue backlog which I believe is up 6% constant currency. Was that roughly five points from acquisition, because obviously that’s being going positive, something we are trying to closely monitor? Michael Gregoire Yes. So of the six points of constant currency, about half of it, three points was related to Veracode which as you know we closed on the absolute last day of the quarter and then Automic. And then the other portion, the other half was related to just the timing of the renewal portfolio that comes due here in fiscal '18, as well as the Q4 new sales. Michael Turits So you are saying it's three points only from acquisitions that’s inorganic in that’s six points. Michael Gregoire That’s correct. Michael Turits Okay. Thanks. I guess, if I squeeze one in. So does that feel though, I mean you said there is some timing. I mean this has been a big deal to talk about, one you felt like that was turning up in a sustainable way. So are those timing issues suggesting that that is not the turn or you think it might be? Michael Gregoire You know I like to hit it straight down the middle with you guys. When the number was flat or slightly negative, I kept reminding you that as the renewal portfolio, there was a lot up for renewal in fiscal '17, that that would influence, in a negative way, the current backlog and similarly as we have a lot of activity stretching out over time, it kind of goes the other way. All that said, I am very happy where we ended the quarter from a position perspective on the revenue backlog. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Daniel Greenfield Daniel Greenfield on for Kirk. Two quick questions. Mike, can you provide just a bit more color on the improvement in sales execution this quarter and just kind of why you believe that can continue into FY '18? And then Kieran, can you just remind us of the assumed impact from Automic and Veracode on revenue guidance for FY '18? And are you going to call out the contribution from these deals individually going forward or just the total impact on revenue and profitability? Thanks. Michael Gregoire Well, with respect to sales execution, I think it comes down to having great products in a business model that sales professionals understand and a marketing team that has done a much much better job being able to articulate not only the strategy of our company and each one of our segments, but how the products work as a single product focus, as well as how those products work together. So when we are talking to customers, they might only want to buy one product but they can see the vision of how these products work together. Continuous delivery, for example. You can buy just one product in continuous delivery but if you think about how you are going to evolve your digital footprint over time and build net new innovations and get up to market quickly, you can see as you are own internal processes improve, how CA products that work together with little to no integration cost, will streamline your ability to turn yourself into a software company. So we kind of call this whole package together. The software factory and as we start putting these elements together, I think what's happening is customers are starting to envision their business in the context of being a software company and we kind of fit the mould really well there. So it's not any one thing. It's great sales execution supported by great product with a marketing team that’s really helping tell, a much broader, more sophisticated story. And Kieran, maybe you can answer the backlog question. Kieran McGrath Yes. So we are to report the acquisitions in total, as we always do. You will be give a clear view of what the acquisitive versus organic contribution is on both the new sales and a revenue perspective. Right now, we are giving guidance for three to four points for the year. We think the acquisitions are going to be roughly worth about 4 points. The reason I am hedging a little bit is I only closed Veracode on the 31 st . We have to do the valuation work and the whole of new impairment. While that work has to be done as we go through time, but we clearly call out the acquisitive nature in aggregate for both of those. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Your line is now open. Abhey Lamba Good execution there. So, Mike, when we are looking at your organic revenue growth this year, how sustainable is it in fiscal '18? I understand you made comments that we should see new sales growth better than your renewal, but your renewals are going to be declining in the high teens, the portfolio is going to be declining in the high teens. So are we modeling the new sales to grow on an organic basis in fiscal '18? Michael Gregoire Yes. I think when we take a look at new sales, we have more wind in our sales then we had in the past, especially on the organic piece. A lot of our new sales are land and expand and coming out of Q3 and Q4 with a lot of land deals, that gives us an opportunity to expand and that will all show up as organic. And with a lot of a new product introductions that we have coupled with this notion of getting these products to work together, we become much more competitive against single product companies, as we are starting to tell our story because at the end of the day, most of these companies are not thinking about just one product or solve one problem, they are trying to orchestrate a digital re-mastering of their business. And in order to do that, you are going to need multiple products, very few companies have multiple products that can work together as well as having those products in their portfolio. So we feel somewhat bullish that we are going to be able to get the organic growth engine moving and have that growing consistently. Kieran, maybe you would like to add to that based on some of the numbers you have been monitoring. Kieran McGrath So I guess, first of all, as you are probably aware, we don’t normally usually guide on new sales as we go forward. However, as Mike has been describing, we think about organic performance, ES revenue actually grew organically in fiscal '17 by two points. The mainframe was down a point. So overall our product revenue was actually flat in '17 with mainframe down a point, and ES up two points. So we look forward to time here. Obviously, we expect the mainframe market is declining in the low single digits to continue our planning at that level of planning, but we would expect to move to a time here that ES will continue to exhibit organic growth. Abhey Lamba Got it. Thanks, Kieran. Absolutely, that's very helpful. Thanks for the additional color. Kieran, you talked about the impact of ASU 2016-09 adoption. Can you quantify the impact on your cash flows in your guidance? Thanks. Kieran McGrath No. Because we are going to actually doing it retrospectively, there will be no changes in the year to year. It's a relatively small amount to begin with but we are going to restate '17 and '18, so there won't be any impact on year to year. Abhey Lamba So what will your fiscal '17 cash flow be in that accounting method? Kieran McGrath Honestly, I don’t have it in front of me here right now. It's about $30 million. Yes. So my guys are telling me here, it's about $30 million. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard So I guess two questions. One similar to what Michael asked you on the revenue backlog. I think the billings backlog may have benefitted as well from the acquisition. Could you quantify what the impact was there from, I guess, Veracode and Automic. Kieran McGrath Right. So from an organic perspective, on the constant currency perspective in total, we are up 9%. The acquisitions contributed about two points to that 9%. Walter Pritchard And what about on the short-term? Kieran McGrath I am sorry, that was the short term number I was saying. The current is growing nine points, two points of that is related to the acquisitions. Walter Pritchard Okay. Great. And then just on, it looks like execution pretty much across the board was pretty good. The one area that I saw in the script, you said that Europe was up, I guess new business was up but you have the benefit I think of Automic, which is probably more biased to Europe. Was there execution issue or anything going on in Europe or was this just kind of normal quarter to quarter volatility in terms of your performance over there. Michael Gregoire Normal, mid-single digit Q4 sales growth in Europe. Automic was a large driver of the new sales growth but I think we haven't seen anything that was other than ordinary. I think we really like the southern region, both France and some of the south did better than what we expected. Walter Pritchard Okay. Got it. And then Kieran, are you going to disclose, I guess for Q4, what the non-recurring and to the extent it happens in Q1, what's the non-recurring related expenses were from the two acquisitions? I think those are in your OpEx. Kieran McGrath So I won't be disclosing specifics. I guess what I would say is that we did have some onetime deal related costs that took place in Q4. As we move into fiscal '18, what we will really be seeing is the impact of both the deferred revenue impairment, the acquisition integration cost, and quite frankly, the Veracode business that we purchased is a business that’s losing money at this point in time. So for the year, we think it's going to be impactful to us. But most of that impact, quite frankly, in the first half of the year and more specifically in the first quarter, but I would say the one time transaction related deal costs are behind us and large and what we are really dealing with now are integration costs, deferred revenue impairment and just the normal business run. Operator Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Mike Gregoire, Chief Executive Officer, for any closing remarks. Michael Gregoire Great. Well, thanks again for joining us this evening. I would like to leave you with a few partying comments. We definitely had a great Q4. We are really pleased with our execution and we are entering fiscal 2018 with solid momentum. That said, please keep in mind that the large system integrator renewal we signed in Q1 last year creates a very difficult compare in Q1 fiscal 2018. And that our recent acquisitions will be most impactful to our operating margins in the first half of fiscal; 2018, particularly in Q1, just as Kieran said. We have made some excellent progress over the last several years building a solid foundation from which we can grow. I am optimistic and I look forward to fiscal 2018 and beyond. Thank you, very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Good afternoon everyone. My name is Carter Gould, I am the Senior Large Cap Biotech Analyst here at UBS and welcome to Day two. Next up is Celgene. Joining me on stage is Michael Pehl, President of Global Hematology and Oncology; and Terrie Curran, President of I&I. So, welcome, thank you both for joining us on stage. I believe, to kick-off, Michael is going to make some comments to set the stage. Why [Indiscernible] and we can kind of -- [Indiscernible] the conversation. Michael Pehl Thank you and thanks for inviting us. It's really great to be here. Before we start with the questions, I just wanted to say that I -- we believe Celgene is an incredibly important and exciting time. We have a fantastic business momentum that is dedicated true for both I&I and for Hematology/Oncology with our existing products. We've been achieving a lot to of clinical and regulatory milestones recently and I hope will have a chance to talk about those a little bit. And then we have this period in the next 18 to 24 months where 18, 19 Phase III studies are going to read out across both franchises, I&I and Hematology/Oncology. And at the same time, I think our mid and late-stage pipelines just gets much more visibility. So, in Hematology/Oncology alone, we're going to have more than 10 pivotal decisions upon new assets that are going to help fuel the growth beyond 2020 and I think there's a similarly rich period coming for I&I. So, there's a lot of momentum ongoing, a lot of exciting data read outs and a great pipeline, and we're all very positive and optimistic and excited at Celgene. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Carter Gould Great. Thank you. So, I didn't know we're going to have Terrie before today. But given the ozanimod sort of have been topic all this week why don't we start there. So, you reported your second positive Phase III [Indiscernible] at MS from RADIANCE yesterday. Definitely a lot of positive data certainly another encouraging sign moving towards approval. At the same time, there was a lot of focus on its disability data and the fact you guys didn't show a relatively high bar that was being set in terms of benefit versus an active comparator. Can you maybe just talk about how the data you have in-house today kind of sets you up for approval and then thinking about commercial? Terrie Curran Sure. Thanks Carter and good afternoon everybody. I think we're very excited about the Phase III data that we see. I think if you look at the base case for ozanimod, we expect to have an oral compound that is as efficacious as the ozanimod market with differentiated side effect profile and tolerability profile. So, I think if you look at the SUNBEAM trial, you'll see that there are a number of levers in terms of differentiation, lower liver toxicity, people -- some of the cardiac toxicity are now [Indiscernible] and then also if you look at lymphocyte recovery, much faster as well as having a shorter half-life. So, I think in totality, if you look at the profile, we're very excited and expected that it will be well differentiated. I think in terms of disability, I think it's important to note that there are no oral compounds that have achieved that endpoint versus an active comparator. I think we were very encouraged to see that the rights of disability progressions, if you look across MS trials more broadly, the rights that we saw across all three active lines were very low. In conjunction with the significant impact that ozanimod had on brain volume, is very encouraging and we expect to move towards bar by the end of the year. Carter Gould Okay. And then maybe just one more question in terms of how you see commercially, the positioning of ozanimod relative to Gilenya. Is this something where the streets should just be expecting ozanimod to compete with sort of Gilenya with new starts? Could we see actual patient switching off Gilenya? How are you thinking about that internally? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you look at the performance emerging in the Phase III, we do expect to be as efficacious as Gilenya, but have -- be differentiated in terms of side effects and tolerability. I think if you look at the liver toxicity, the cardiac toxicity as well as lymphocyte recovery, we expect that ozanimod will perform much better they are now. Our base case is to have a class label in terms of first dose monitoring. But I think as we see the totality of the data, we'll be able to have a conversation with the regulators and look to having some differentiation in the label. I think with -- both the specificity of the compound as well as the titration, we're not getting some of those off-target cardiac effects that we see with Gilenya.  Carter Gould Okay, great. Michael, maybe going back, starting with Revlimid. Seems to be the starting point of most of conversation. Michael Pehl That's the logic of starting. Carter Gould You've had a couple of successes here. Clinical and regulatory went with Revlimid and myeloma and really kind of opening up or expanding the European opportunity. I guess taking a step back, when you think about the front-line setting and maintenance in myeloma for Revlimid, is there any reason to think that the European market -- and I'm thinking about in terms of penetration duration can't match kind of what you're expecting or what you've seen already in the U.S.? Michael Pehl Yes, that's a very important question. And let me start by saying while Europe is more important when it comes to the opportunity coming from stem cell transplantation maintenance, there is an opportunity in U.S. already also. There is usage in U.S. since quite some time. But the label is not just allowing us to promote, there's kind of 50% of the patients that are first line and eligible for stem cell transportation, either don't get maintenance or get maintenance, but not until treatment in progression. So there's a true and sizable opportunity in the U.S. But then the opportunity in Europe is obviously bigger. We already have reimbursement in six European markets. So very, very quick. And we're working on others. The value proposition is extremely strong. We've been doing a meta-analysis. You may recall that with six -- with three clinical studies with more than 1,300 patients showing an over-survival benefit of more than 2.5 years for Revlimid maintenance. And I think that's really an unprecedented value proposition. So, I think it's not by chance that we're seeing this very rapid reimbursement in European markets. There's no reason to believe that in terms of penetration and duration, we should not get exactly where the U.S. is at. We just have to go through this 18 to 24 months of reimbursement negotiations before the different markets. But once that is done, I think we are very, very optimistic that we can catch up with the U.S., absolutely. Carter Gould Okay. And on that duration angle, certainly, when we run our models, that's a big driver of Revlimid's growth over the next -- through the balance of the decade. We've talked at length before around sort of the kinetics of the benefits from these novel-novel combinations sort of kicking in and sort of further accelerating sales growth. Can you maybe just walk through that a little bit? I think there's a point that flossed at a lot of investors and you sort of have to outpace the prior regimen's progression. And I guess at what point should we really kind of expect to see the benefit materialize and-- Michael Pehl Of course, a very relevant question as well. And once again, saying duration is a very important driver for us in terms of Revlimid performance. We have others. We talked about stem cell transportation. Lymphoma studies that are reading out for the end of the year. So there's more coming. But duration is definitely a key driver. Where we're at, at this moment in time is in the U.S., we have a treatment duration of round about 24 months. If we add our patients, who get Revlimid in first line and in any shape or form in a second or data line treatment, Europe is not quite there yet. They are 13 to 14 months. But for both sides of the Atlantic, treatment duration is increasing. And there's a couple of key drivers for that. Starting with the newly diagnosed labels that we're talking about. So if you can give Revlimid, your treatment duration is increasing. You should not forget that, especially in the maintenance setting, the treatment duration can be extremely long. The other key driver in that regard are the triplet regimen. And just to remind everybody, we've been seeing different triplet regimens reading out. The first ones that we saw with [Indiscernible] elotuzumab and with [Indiscernible], they had progression-free survival. And I think that's a very good surrogate for treatment duration of somewhere between 20 to 26 months. Now we see the daratumumab combinations with treatment durations up to 48 months. And that's just for the relapsed/refractory setting, that's also first treatment coming now in the first-line setting. RVD's an example, which has been showing a one-year over-survival benefit, also showing a progression-free survival of that magnitude. So, when you're thinking about 24 months in U.S. all-in and then 48 months plus with the new triplet regimen, there is still a real good and long way to go. To your point, in order to see this effect accelerating, you need to get over the 24 months that you're having already. We saw the approvals of the new triplet regimen starting like one to two years ago. So, I think by this year, we're starting to see the effects of the triplets kicking in. And the same thing is going to happen when we're looking at Europe, the stem cell transportation and the effect that it has on treatment duration. So, it's just going to take a little bit of time. You have to go beyond what you have already. But that's a very, very nice growth opportunity for the long-term for us without any doubt. Carter Gould And then just from a strategy and messaging, I mean the messaging around Revlimid has been fairly consistent or has been evolving in the same direction, right, give it early, give it often, give it through progression. But that -- I guess that messaging starts to get a little bit more complicated when you think about either patient segmentation, patient stratification as you get to the end of this decade and into next. It may sort of -- there's some low-hanging fruit, probably to put it a little too casually, but -- in the high-risk segment. But when you think about like after Revlimid and you start having to cut up these populations. I mean does that represent a challenge to you and your messaging or...  Michael Pehl Well, it almost represents a challenge in terms of bringing together translational data and clinical data in a way that I think is unprecedented, right? The current triplet reality is giving us a lot and a true improvement upon tablet reality. I just wanted to say this word of caution; not every myeloma patient can get a triplet. There's this large elderly frail population out there. The majority of patients with multiple myeloma is unfortunately over 75 years old. So, giving them triplets is not an easy thing. Again, the fact that the tablets of either -- whether it's pomalidomide or Revlimid is working so well as a tablet, I think makes what we're having also very, very unique. But when we're thinking about the next step -- and the next step is definitely this kind of long-term remission and even cure for patients. The starting point is to think about where is the medical need? And it's -- you can define this by different ways. There is a lot of patients, unfortunately, which starts to become refractory against four or five regimens, right? And those patients have a life expectancy of less than 1 year, sometimes even less than a couple of weeks. So, that's a way of looking at a patient population in need. We've been talking about the elderly frail patients already, where triplets is not an option. But then thinking more about the cumulative approach, the most efficacious triplet at this moment of time is probably Revlimid and daratumumab, right? And there was a New England publication on that. When you're looking at the progression-free survival cost in that publication, you see that a third of the patient is relapsing after six 12 months. Those patients, a third -- those patients have a life expectancy of three weeks -- of three years at a maximum. So, what we try to do at this moment of time is to try besides the obvious clinical segment, a molecularly defined segments of medical needs. Who are those patients? What is their genetics? What is the role of the immune system? What is the role of the microenvironment? Why are patients -- and that's another group at risk -- why is their patients are not achieving MRD-negative disease? And what is the biology of that disease? So that's one thing. So, we think we really make great progress in defining those molecularly and clinically. The second really important thing, especially when we think about bringing new technologies, such as BCMA, CAR-T early and broad, is can we come up with new endpoints. So, the traditional endpoint in multiple myeloma has been overall survival and progression-free survival, of course, both used as a surrogate for all. But we're making a very, very big effort together with academia and regulatory authorities and also in working together with other companies in trying to make sure that MRD-negativity is going to become an accepted endpoint for our study. And then as part of this effort we learn -- what we learn is what are the combinations and the therapeutic approaches that is most suitable for the segments that we have been defining. Not every combination is equal. There is probably combinations where you try to combine an EMIT [ph] and BCMA or BCMA alone. There's others where it's going to be an EMIT in the CD38. There's others where you're going to go for BCMA. And that's what we are learning. What we hope that we're going to have by the end of the year is all the data points necessary from our clinical studies, from our translational efforts, and from our regulatory efforts in order to be able to bring all of that together and then position the right combination and the right patient segment. That's the ongoing effort. Its complex, but I think it's going to be extremely rewarding because the result of that is going to be a very, very meaningful improvement of the outcome of those patients. Carter Gould Okay. Maybe switching gears to Revlimid. In follicular, you're going to have relevance and augment read out later this year. There's another, some of the incremental data coming at ASCO. When you think about ultimately, where Revlimid -- and really -- R square can be sort of positioned in follicular, I guess we often get some pushback from some docs. They see that more as a second-line regimen, even though you clearly are going after the front-line setting too. I guess what's the -- it might just be inertia from these docs, who just haven't had access to an overall combo before. But I mean, is there a higher clinical hurdle than just sort of bettering our chemo in that setting? Is there -- do you have to really kind of blow through it to get over that inertia and that's sort of entrenched to your point? Michael Pehl Yes. So, I think the way to think about and answer this question is really again, coming from the medical need. Where is the medical need? And just to remind everybody, so we are talking about in the lymph -- lymphoma, which is follicular lymphoma. There's a couple of others. Those are mostly elderly, frail patients with a very impaired immune system. The main treatment for those patients is the combination, as Carter said, of rituximab and chemotherapy that can be dropped, but then also others. Those patients are tolerating the chemotherapy extremely badly. It's like -- if you think about, this is a non-curative approach. Those patients are going to get progression-free survival for a period of time and then they are relapsing. The price to pay is weeks in hospital. You send those patients basically to hospitals for a very, very long time. What -- the other thing is the RAs are low, and remissions are very short-lived. I think the combination of all of that, when you think about it, makes us quite extremely effective -- extremely interesting and attractive. Very good tolerability profile. And I think we've been really generating data in hundreds of patients, whether you're talking about the magnified study. We have an update that is very interesting at ASCO. We also have the randomized study at the last ASH Congress in the first-line setting. So, extremely well-tolerated regimen, very high CR rate and very convenient. So, we really think that this is going to provide a great alternative. And as a consequence of the data that has been generated and system guidelines have been very broadly updated, I think it has this combination of medical need clear, great profile of the drug, great evidence. And so we think on the basis of the read out of the studies, R square is going to be a huge success in the population. Carter Gould Okay, great. Moving again to luspatercept, as somebody who covers both Acceleron and Celgene. It's been great to see the evolution your messaging to The Street here and the potential of this drug. I think most people acknowledge the drug, holds incredible promise in RS+ patients. The RS-, we saw some emerging data in that segment coming out of Valencia a couple of weeks ago. When you think ultimately about the potential of moving into that segment, you've already signaled that you're going to do one front-line study. Is it more a question of just when not, if you get around to moving into the RS- population or is efficient service still being hashed out? Michael Pehl I think it's -- it's actually both. It's a matter of when. And so for those of you have not been in Valencia, the data that Carter has been referring to is data of around about 60 patients that has been generated in a front line low risk MDS setting and in a population with an EPO level below 500 and a certain number of transfusions were below, the response rates were very high and the rate of transfusion independence was for both being zero plus positive and negative patients in the 50% to 60% mark, which is what you know from Revlimid and del 5q. So, incredibly good and very important durable improvements and transfusion independence for those patients. So, that is a large population. The current standard of care, by the way, is EPO, where you can get in the patient populations, where those products have worked well. You get low response rates and what you get is not durable. So, medical need is there, data that -- the ring sideroblast-negative observation is interesting. And from the observations that we have in the late-line lowest population where we only were -- we have a Phase III study ongoing that is only in the ring sideroblast-positive population, we were actually not quite sure whether it looks part of the business and would be an option for those patients or whether we would have to go into combination, which is something that we intended to explore. Anyway, but those new data suggests that we can include ring sideroblast-negative patients as well. Before we take in the front line trend, before we take the final decision, we just want to create a little bit more data in order to be sure. We're going to take a decision about the expecting fusion criteria by the end of the year so that we can start the study and somewhere -- kind of by the beginning of 2018. I think this is a very, very exciting observation. It can even further broaden beyond ring sideroblast-positive MDS and myelofibrosis, where we're also running studies and [Indiscernible] can even broaden the population for luspatercept. So, very exciting. We just want to be sure and create a little bit more data into next month and then we're going to move ahead full speed. Carter Gould Okay, great. Just coming back to myelofibrosis since you brought it up Mike, often referred as sort of the one -- myeloid indication that got away from you guys. When you think about moving luspatercept into that setting, is the plan to go after [Indiscernible], before [Indiscernible], in combination with [Indiscernible]. How do you think about where, I guess, coming back to your point, where the medical need in MS today? Michael Pehl Well, so the first thing that we need to do is to confirm the observation that has been obtained for the sister drug, which is sotatercept in a population and learn as to what -- and we -- and for those of you who don't know, so that was data shown at ASH with sotatercept in myelofibrosis, it was a Phase I/II study. So, those funding study and those patients achieved 40% of a transfusion independent, which is very, very remarkable. I think that's the highest that has ever been reported. So, we want to repeat the data with more translation of rigor, with luspatercept. And I think it's fair to say that, that's kind of the first study that we're going to do is in a population where geography is even not working on patients, who have [Indiscernible] already. I think in the longer term, the thinking is that you will probably like to combine those two. But the starting point is, for us, let's have a very clean population in order to learn as much as possible, hopefully, even in reaching patients further beyond what we've been seeing in our initial studies and then moving forward -- and that could actually then be -- also lead into the combinatorial approach. Carter Gould Terrie, coming back to you. I think about ozanimod going into IBD. We've had some incremental data from some competitors in ulcerative colitis earlier this week. I know we only have about two and a half minutes left. But if you can just kind of summarize to us kind of how you feel ozanimod sets up competitively in usage? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you think about the disease, there's a large unmet need. I mean many of these patients are progressing on to surgeries and the existing therapies within a year, many having relapses. So I think there's a real need within the therapy area for products that is effective, that is oral, that has kind of a reasonably benign safety profile. So, I think if you think about the ozanimod profile, it kind of ticks the boxes in those three elements. So, I think a large unmet need, chronic disease, where I think the profile of ozanimod would really fit perfectly in the first line. Carter Gould Okay. And when you think about the data we got out of RADIANCE, so at least, on the safety side, does that give you any more comfort with the safety thinking about and using it? Terrie Curran Yes, I think you see the safety profile in RADIANCE is very consistent with the safety profile that we saw in SUNBEAM. And I think if you look at the key elements, would there be cardiac safety, liver toxicity, lymphocyte recovery, we're seeing very, very positive and very excited about the profile. Carter Gould And on that safety side, I think everybody sort of -- or most people, I think appreciate the cardiotoxic and the burden that puts on caregivers in, at least, in that first dose. But when you -- can you maybe just expand on the toxicity and how important that is, how you think that might play out, at least... Terrie Curran So, I think if you think about tolerability, it's about 14% of patients discontinue Gilenya because of the other toxicity. So, if you look at the Phase III someday we're seeing much lower rates of toxicity and improve tolerability. So, from both decision's point of view and a patient's point of view, very compelling profile for that disease. Carter Gould Great. All right Terrie, Michael, thank you very much. Michael Pehl Thanks very much, Carter. Terrie Curran Thank you. Michael Pehl Thanks everybody. Terrie Curran Thank you.

So, I didn't know we're going to have Terrie before today. But given the ozanimod sort of have been topic all this week why don't we start there. So, you reported your second positive Phase III [Indiscernible] at MS from RADIANCE yesterday. Definitely a lot of positive data certainly another encouraging sign moving towards approval. At the same time, there was a lot of focus on its disability data and the fact you guys didn't show a relatively high bar that was being set in terms of benefit versus an active comparator. Can you maybe just talk about how the data you have in-house today kind of sets you up for approval and then thinking about commercial? Terrie Curran Sure. Thanks Carter and good afternoon everybody. I think we're very excited about the Phase III data that we see. I think if you look at the base case for ozanimod, we expect to have an oral compound that is as efficacious as the ozanimod market with differentiated side effect profile and tolerability profile. So, I think if you look at the SUNBEAM trial, you'll see that there are a number of levers in terms of differentiation, lower liver toxicity, people -- some of the cardiac toxicity are now [Indiscernible] and then also if you look at lymphocyte recovery, much faster as well as having a shorter half-life. So, I think in totality, if you look at the profile, we're very excited and expected that it will be well differentiated. I think in terms of disability, I think it's important to note that there are no oral compounds that have achieved that endpoint versus an active comparator. I think we were very encouraged to see that the rights of disability progressions, if you look across MS trials more broadly, the rights that we saw across all three active lines were very low. In conjunction with the significant impact that ozanimod had on brain volume, is very encouraging and we expect to move towards bar by the end of the year. Carter Gould Okay. And then maybe just one more question in terms of how you see commercially, the positioning of ozanimod relative to Gilenya. Is this something where the streets should just be expecting ozanimod to compete with sort of Gilenya with new starts? Could we see actual patient switching off Gilenya? How are you thinking about that internally? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you look at the performance emerging in the Phase III, we do expect to be as efficacious as Gilenya, but have -- be differentiated in terms of side effects and tolerability. I think if you look at the liver toxicity, the cardiac toxicity as well as lymphocyte recovery, we expect that ozanimod will perform much better they are now. Our base case is to have a class label in terms of first dose monitoring. But I think as we see the totality of the data, we'll be able to have a conversation with the regulators and look to having some differentiation in the label. I think with -- both the specificity of the compound as well as the titration, we're not getting some of those off-target cardiac effects that we see with Gilenya.  Carter Gould Okay, great. Michael, maybe going back, starting with Revlimid. Seems to be the starting point of most of conversation. Michael Pehl That's the logic of starting.

The main treatment for those patients is the combination, as Carter said, of rituximab and chemotherapy that can be dropped, but then also others. Those patients are tolerating the chemotherapy extremely badly. It's like -- if you think about, this is a non-curative approach. Those patients are going to get progression-free survival for a period of time and then they are relapsing. The price to pay is weeks in hospital. You send those patients basically to hospitals for a very, very long time. What -- the other thing is the RAs are low, and remissions are very short-lived. I think the combination of all of that, when you think about it, makes us quite extremely effective -- extremely interesting and attractive. Very good tolerability profile. And I think we've been really generating data in hundreds of patients, whether you're talking about the magnified study. We have an update that is very interesting at ASCO. We also have the randomized study at the last ASH Congress in the first-line setting. So, extremely well-tolerated regimen, very high CR rate and very convenient. So, we really think that this is going to provide a great alternative. And as a consequence of the data that has been generated and system guidelines have been very broadly updated, I think it has this combination of medical need clear, great profile of the drug, great evidence. And so we think on the basis of the read out of the studies, R square is going to be a huge success in the population. Carter Gould Okay, great. Moving again to luspatercept, as somebody who covers both Acceleron and Celgene. It's been great to see the evolution your messaging to The Street here and the potential of this drug. I think most people acknowledge the drug, holds incredible promise in RS+ patients. The RS-, we saw some emerging data in that segment coming out of Valencia a couple of weeks ago. When you think ultimately about the potential of moving into that segment, you've already signaled that you're going to do one front-line study. Is it more a question of just when not, if you get around to moving into the RS- population or is efficient service still being hashed out? Michael Pehl I think it's -- it's actually both. It's a matter of when. And so for those of you have not been in Valencia, the data that Carter has been referring to is data of around about 60 patients that has been generated in a front line low risk MDS setting and in a population with an EPO level below 500 and a certain number of transfusions were below, the response rates were very high and the rate of transfusion independence was for both being zero plus positive and negative patients in the 50% to 60% mark, which is what you know from Revlimid and del 5q. So, incredibly good and very important durable improvements and transfusion independence for those patients. So, that is a large population. The current standard of care, by the way, is EPO, where you can get in the patient populations, where those products have worked well. You get low response rates and what you get is not durable. So, medical need is there, data that -- the ring sideroblast-negative observation is interesting. And from the observations that we have in the late-line lowest population where we only were -- we have a Phase III study ongoing that is only in the ring sideroblast-positive population, we were actually not quite sure whether it looks part of the business and would be an option for those patients or whether we would have to go into combination, which is something that we intended to explore. Anyway, but those new data suggests that we can include ring sideroblast-negative patients as well. Before we take in the front line trend, before we take the final decision, we just want to create a little bit more data in order to be sure. We're going to take a decision about the expecting fusion criteria by the end of the year so that we can start the study and somewhere -- kind of by the beginning of 2018. I think this is a very, very exciting observation. It can even further broaden beyond ring sideroblast-positive MDS and myelofibrosis, where we're also running studies and [Indiscernible] can even broaden the population for luspatercept. So, very exciting. We just want to be sure and create a little bit more data into next month and then we're going to move ahead full speed. Carter Gould Okay, great. Just coming back to myelofibrosis since you brought it up Mike, often referred as sort of the one -- myeloid indication that got away from you guys. When you think about moving luspatercept into that setting, is the plan to go after [Indiscernible], before [Indiscernible], in combination with [Indiscernible]. How do you think about where, I guess, coming back to your point, where the medical need in MS today? Michael Pehl Well, so the first thing that we need to do is to confirm the observation that has been obtained for the sister drug, which is sotatercept in a population and learn as to what -- and we -- and for those of you who don't know, so that was data shown at ASH with sotatercept in myelofibrosis, it was a Phase I/II study. So, those funding study and those patients achieved 40% of a transfusion independent, which is very, very remarkable. I think that's the highest that has ever been reported. So, we want to repeat the data with more translation of rigor, with luspatercept. And I think it's fair to say that, that's kind of the first study that we're going to do is in a population where geography is even not working on patients, who have [Indiscernible] already. I think in the longer term, the thinking is that you will probably like to combine those two. But the starting point is, for us, let's have a very clean population in order to learn as much as possible, hopefully, even in reaching patients further beyond what we've been seeing in our initial studies and then moving forward -- and that could actually then be -- also lead into the combinatorial approach. Carter Gould Terrie, coming back to you. I think about ozanimod going into IBD. We've had some incremental data from some competitors in ulcerative colitis earlier this week. I know we only have about two and a half minutes left. But if you can just kind of summarize to us kind of how you feel ozanimod sets up competitively in usage? Terrie Curran Yes, I think if you think about the disease, there's a large unmet need. I mean many of these patients are progressing on to surgeries and the existing therapies within a year, many having relapses. So I think there's a real need within the therapy area for products that is effective, that is oral, that has kind of a reasonably benign safety profile. So, I think if you think about the ozanimod profile, it kind of ticks the boxes in those three elements. So, I think a large unmet need, chronic disease, where I think the profile of ozanimod would really fit perfectly in the first line. Carter Gould Okay. And when you think about the data we got out of RADIANCE, so at least, on the safety side, does that give you any more comfort with the safety thinking about and using it? Terrie Curran Yes, I think you see the safety profile in RADIANCE is very consistent with the safety profile that we saw in SUNBEAM. And I think if you look at the key elements, would there be cardiac safety, liver toxicity, lymphocyte recovery, we're seeing very, very positive and very excited about the profile. Carter Gould And on that safety side, I think everybody sort of -- or most people, I think appreciate the cardiotoxic and the burden that puts on caregivers in, at least, in that first dose. But when you -- can you maybe just expand on the toxicity and how important that is, how you think that might play out, at least... Terrie Curran So, I think if you think about tolerability, it's about 14% of patients discontinue Gilenya because of the other toxicity. So, if you look at the Phase III someday we're seeing much lower rates of toxicity and improve tolerability. So, from both decision's point of view and a patient's point of view, very compelling profile for that disease. Carter Gould Great. All right Terrie, Michael, thank you very much. Michael Pehl Thanks very much, Carter. Terrie Curran Thank you. Michael Pehl Thanks everybody. Terrie Curran Thank you.

Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Thank you, Nicole. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the call. I\'ll lead off today with a review of the numbers. Zane Burke, our President, will follow me with results, highlights, and marketplace observations. And then Mike Nill, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide some operational highlights. Now I will turn to our results. Q1 was a good start to 2017, with bookings, revenue, and earnings all at the high end of our guidance ranges. Starting with bookings, our bookings in Q1 was $1.25 billion, which reflects a 7% increase over Q1 of 2016. Our revenue backlog ended the quarter at $16.098 billion, which is up 10% from $14.615 billion a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was $1.26 billion, which is up 11% over Q1 of 2016, driven by a strong growth in system sales and services. The revenue composition for Q1 was $320 million in system sales, $262 million in support and maintenance, $656 million in services, and $22 million in reimbursed travel. System sales revenue for the quarter was up 14% compared to Q1 of 2016, then driven primarily by strong licensed software growth, as well as solid growth in technology resale. The higher level of software is reflected in the strong system sales margin percent of 68.6%, which is up 50 basis points over Q1 of 2016 and 150 basis points over Q4 of 2016. Moving to services, total services revenue, including professional and managed services, was up 11% compared to Q1 of 2016. Support and maintenance revenue increased 4% for the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. Looking at revenue by geographic segment, domestic revenue increased 13% over the year-ago quarter to $1.13 billion and non-U.S. revenue declined 3% to $129 million. On non-U.S. revenue decline, note that currency fluctuations impacted revenue by about 2%, so revenue was basically flat on a constant currency basis. In addition, the primary driver of the lack of growth was a decline in non-U.S. technology resale. Moving to gross margin, our gross margin for Q1 was 84.2% which is basically flat compared to a year ago and up a 130 basis points compared to Q4 of 2016. Now I\'ll discuss spending, operating margin, and net earnings. For these items, we provide both GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP results. The adjusted results exclude share-based compensation expense, share-based compensation permanent tax items, Health Services acquisition-related amortization, acquisition-related deferred revenue adjustments, and other acquisition-related adjustments which are detailed and reconciled to GAAP in our earnings release. The adjustment for share-based compensation permanent tax items is a new adjustment this year to incorporate a new accounting standard adopted in Q1, which is designed to simplify accounting for share-based compensation. There is more information in our release, but we are basically reducing our adjusted earnings by the amount of the permanent tax benefit, so our results will be comparable to prior periods. In addition, not including this tax benefit should reduce significant swings in our adjusted tax rate that would occur if we did not adjust it out. Looking at operating spending, our first-quarter GAAP operating expenses of $817 million were up 9% compared to $747 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses were $773 million, which is up 10% compared to Q1 of 2016. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in personnel expense related to revenue generating associates, which is reflected in the sales and client service expense line that increased 12%. Software development increased 9%, driven by non-cash items as we had $4 million less capitalized software and $8 million more amortization than Q1 of 2016. G&A expense was up 3%. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles decreased by $1 million. Moving to operating margins, our Q1 GAAP operating margin was 19.4% compared to 18.9% in the year-ago period. Our adjusted operating margin was 22.9% in Q1, which is essentially flat to the year-ago period and in line with previously communicated expectations. Moving to net earnings and EPS, our GAAP net earnings in Q1 were $173 million or $0.52 per diluted share. Adjusted net earnings were $198 million and adjusted diluted EPS was $0.59, up 11% from $0.53 in Q1 of 2016. Our GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29%. When excluding the share-based compensation permanent tax items, the Q1 tax rate was 31%, which is basically flat compared to a year ago. Note that we also had a $3.3 million write-down of a venture capital investment as reflected in the other income line. Now move to our balance sheet. We ended Q1 with $609 million of total cash and investments, which is up from $466 million in Q4. Moving to debt, our total debt, including capital lease obligations, was $550 million, which is down slightly compared to Q4. Total receivables ended the quarter at $986 million, which is up from $945 million in Q4. Our Q1 DSO was 71 days, which is up from 69 days in Q4 and down from 76 days in the year-ago period. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $304 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $88 million, and capitalized software was $71 million. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital purchases and capitalized software development costs, was $144 million for the quarter. Note that our operating cash flow reflects certain classification changes required by the previously mentioned new accounting standard adopted in Q1. For Q1 2017, this impact resulted in approximately $12 million more operating cash flow than under the prior accounting guidance. We have also recast 2016 cashless to reflect this change, which resulted in Q1 of 2016 operating cash flows increasing by $9 million over what was previously reported. Regarding free cash flow, we still expect to increase our free cash flow by at least $150 million under the prior classification method. It also likely we will drive a similar increase under the new method, unless the tax impact of share-based compensation is materially lower in 2017. Either way, we expect strong free cash flow this year. Finally, you will see that we added a cash flow statement to our press release schedules. Now I\'ll go through guidance. We expect revenue in Q2 to be between $1.265 billion and $1.335 billion, with the midpoint reflecting growth of 7% over Q2 of 2016. For the full year we continue to expect revenue between $5.1 billion and $5.3 billion, reflecting 8% growth over 2016 at the midpoint. We expect Q2 adjusted diluted EPS to be $0.60 to $0.62 per share, with a midpoint reflecting 5% growth over Q2 of 2016. For the full year, we still expect adjusted diluted EPS to be $2.44 to $2.56, with a midpoint reflecting 9% growth over 2016. Moving to bookings guidance, we expect bookings revenue in Q2 of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. The midpoint is basically flat compared to Q2 of 2016, which is our toughest comparable in 2016. We continue to expect bookings growth for the full year. In summary, we feel like we\'ve started the year on a solid note, and we have a good outlook for the rest of the year. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Zane. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Marc. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I\'ll provide color on our results and make some marketplace observations. I\'ll start with bookings. As Marc mentioned earlier, our Q1 bookings of $1.25 billion reflects 7% growth over Q1 of 2016. This growth was achieved without a new Cerner ITWorks contract, which we indicated was our expectation when we provided guidance. In total, 24% of bookings came from long-term contracts, which is flat compared to Q1 of 2016 but below the 30%-plus average for the past several years. As Mike will discuss, we remain confident this will be a good year for Works bookings, with stronger contributions expected to begin next quarter. The main highlight of the quarter was our competitiveness and volume of new footprints, as reflected in 37% of bookings coming from outside our core Millennium installed base. This included multiple head-to-head wins against our primary competitor. A noteworthy example was being selected by a Top 100 health system located in a top 10 metropolitan area for a full suite of acute EHR, ambulatory and Revenue Cycle solutions. Additionally, we were selected by another organization in the Southeast that is one of the largest publicly owned health systems in the U.S. Finally, we continue to see our large health system clients move more of their sites to Cerner as they look to get off legacy systems and standardize on Millennium. One client this quarter contracted to move 10 sites from a competitor\'s legacy system to Cerner Millennium. And we have many more sites that could be transitioned to Cerner in the future. As we have discussed, our health system clients still have a significant number of sites on competitors\' legacy systems that represent future opportunities. Overall, our competitiveness is as good as it\'s ever been. We believe our primary competitor continues to be in a more defensive stance as a result of numerous factors, including cost overruns, that have impacted their clients financially and become more widely known in the marketplace. We also believe that our predictable total cost of ownership, contemporary architecture, ability to demonstrate value, and solid and strong population health capabilities position us to continue having success against this competitor and others. Beyond our strength in new business, we also had good contribution from other growth areas, such as population health and Revenue Cycle, with both positioned to deliver strong double-digit growth for the year. In population health, despite the uncertainty of exactly when the broader shift from fee-for-service to value-based care will occur, there continues to be a high interest in our population health solutions as providers realize they need to begin preparing for the shift long before it occurs. Further, we are able to demonstrate the ability of the HealtheIntent Platform to help our clients optimize performance in their fee-for-service business models while they are also preparing for new reimbursement models. In Revenue Cycle, the strength continues to be driven by both new EHR clients including Revenue Cycle with their purchase, as well as further penetrating our existing EHR base with our Revenue Cycle solutions. We are also seeing increased demand for Revenue Cycle services, including targeted projects, transition services, business office management, and full outsourcing. We also had a solid quarter in smaller venues with our Ambulatory and CommunityWorks offerings. In Ambulatory, we had success with extending our solutions to the ambulatory facilities of our large health system clients, which led to the displacement of several different ambulatory competitors during the quarter. We also had another strong quarter in Ambulatory Business Office Services. In CommunityWorks, we had a solid quarter that included multiple – beating multiple niche competitors. Activity remains high and we have a very good outlook for the year. Next, I\'d like to provide a quick update on our project with the Department of Defense. As we\'ve discussed, we had a successful first go-live earlier this year, and we remain on track for additional go-lives throughout the year. We are honored to be part of this project and we are very pleased with the early success, which is a result of great effort by the Department of Defense, Cerner, Leidos, and other partners. This project is making Cerner better, and I believe it ultimately benefits all our clients and is leading to enhanced implementation processes, advancements in cyber security, and sometimes connected technologies. We remained very focused on continuing to deliver for the Department of Defense, which we believe will help prepare and position us for other opportunities. Moving to our business outside the U.S., despite the flat revenue Mark mentioned, we had a strong start to the year from a bookings standpoint. The strength of bookings was broad-based with over 20% bookings growth in Canada, Australia, Germany, Belgium, and the UK. Of note were two significant academic systems, including our first large client in Belgium and a very significant academic system in Australia. Both were won after rigorous and highly competitive selection processes that included our primary competitor. Now I\'d like to provide some observations on the U.S. marketplace. As I discussed last quarter, while there are unknowns about the future of Obamacare and the timing of the shift to value-based care, we are not seeing this have a material impact on our results. I think it\'s important to step back from the noise and consider that the dialog around Obamacare and its Republican alternatives is mainly focused on access and insurance reform, not care delivery reform. There isn\'t much of a discussion around the cost of care delivery. If not addressed, the cost implications of the baby boomers hitting retirement, increases in chronic conditions, and reimbursement being tied to volume will lead to our healthcare costs continuing to grow as a percent of GDP at an unsustainable rate. We continue to believe information technology is the single biggest lever to drive cost down and quality up. From a policy standpoint, we believe the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, is an important step in the right direction. Unlike meaningful use, which mandated EHR adoption without requiring proof of better outcomes, MACRA rewards providers who achieve better outcomes and penalizes providers who do not. As the payer for roughly 50% of the care in the U.S., the federal government can use their leverage to push towards value-based care, and now that the core system is mostly digital, they can demand the measurements that are needed to do this. With the change in the administration, we are seeing a predictable review, but most policymakers seem confident that MACRA and the overall shift to value-based reimbursement will continue. In our view, based on the forces and pressures that drive healthcare spending, it\'s hard to imagine ignoring the power of shifting from fee-for-service to a value-based system inside a competitive marketplace. And we clearly believe Cerner can play an important role in this shift. In summary, we believe we are well positioned in an active marketplace, with both near-term and long-term drivers of business opportunity for Cerner. With that, I\'ll turn the call over to Mike. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Thanks, Zane. Good afternoon, everyone. Today I\'m going to discuss ITWorks and some initiatives that are focused on driving operational efficiencies, while also improving our quality. I\'ll start with ITWorks. As Zane mentioned, and as contemplated in our forecast, we didn\'t have a new ITWorks deal in Q1. However, we did have an existing client expand and extend their ITWorks contract. We also had good sales back into our ITWorks base, which is an important part of our ITWorks model. Despite a lack of recent new deals, the ITWorks value proposition is resonating with many of our clients as we look to control costs, achieve operational excellence, and maintain security across the enterprise. Looking ahead, we believe – we still believe several of the opportunities we contemplated in 2016 will be closed in 2017, and we continue to add opportunities to our pipeline. In total, we believe 2017 could be a record year for ITWorks bookings. Now I\'d like to briefly discuss two examples of initiatives focused on driving quality and efficiency. The first example is our focus on clinician productivity and satisfaction. One of CERN\'s unique competitive advantages is our ability to leverage analytics to understand the user experience within our solutions. With a tool called Cerner Advance, we create the ability to measure the EHR efficiency of each clinician and benchmark them against peers by specialty and venue. This unparalleled ability allows us to proactively identify areas of opportunity, engage with our clients to create data-driven plans for improvement, and measure the impact of these changes. Over 8,000 users and 500 organizations have leveraged this capability to advance their organizations towards best practices that represent more effective and efficient utilization of our solutions. Another example of our focus is making our systems continuously available. One measure of this has been our ability to provide four nines of availability through our leading hosting capabilities. Going beyond this, we are now able to achieve continuous availability even during a Millennium release upgrade. This is significant – this is a significant achievement, and we have already performed many release upgrades without incurring downtime. This accomplishment takes us a step closer towards our goal of continuous delivery, which I discussed at our HIMSS Investor Meeting. Through continuous delivery, we expect to enable automatic deployment of updates and new innovations, which should significantly increase the rate of adoption, lower cost of ownership, and an improve or our speed to market. In summary, we believe these advancements will create significant value for our clients and drive tremendous productivity increases throughout Cerner. We also believe the ability to quickly deliver solutions at a lower cost will become more important as the financial pressures increase for our clients, and our ability to do this will become a competitive advantage. With that I\'ll turn the call to over questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it\'s a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn\'t see you in the market, although we\'ve seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and/or other cash activity this year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn\'t anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing – by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end – when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think – I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don\'t think – I think the future for us will be fairly consistent. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you\'re seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the – we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a – and that\'s kind of been a trend that we\'ve seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we\'ve seen that in terms of that percentage. As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we\'ve seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there\'s both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we\'re seeing the success that we\'ve had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after – we want to go after – that we\'re going after, and that there\'s a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they\'re of a bigger size than what we\'ve seen historically. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I think what we\'re saying is, it\'s kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky\'s question. In terms of this – in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Most of these are in-house situations, so they\'re not typically outsourced, but they\'re looking – as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline. What we\'re seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they\'re looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it\'s both the opportunity to move faster, it\'s also the execution success we\'ve had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms – and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We\'re able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model. We\'ve done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we\'ve been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we\'re able to jump off of and take the rest of the client\'s business in a bigger and broader space. And we\'ve earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that\'s allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we\'re seeing them – we\'re seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they\'re getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that\'s a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That\'s helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing – sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we\'re actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I don\'t think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we\'re looking – for the year, we\'re looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter\'s call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we\'re going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we\'re pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year. That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that – we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we\'re back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I\'m not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is – the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA\'s process? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, David. So, the – I\'ll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it\'s gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about. As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for – to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into – so, anything beyond that is speculation. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So we\'re taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we\'re taking share across all the competition. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it\'s going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It\'s really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we\'ve talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn\'t happened for a while. So we\'re definitely, we\'re excited about that. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don\'t know that I would absolutely say we\'ve got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we\'re also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half. So, I think that – as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it\'s not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. That\'s great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it\'s wasted, and move your way? I\'m just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don\'t have funding backing them up, and it\'s all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Great question. So it\'s interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there\'s not a total way – simple way to overly generalize, but I\'ll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they\'re doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they\'re actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have. And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that\'s part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that\'s one where they\'re trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it\'s a double positive for them. In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it\'s really – they\'re trying to do twofold. They\'re trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they\'re on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we\'re able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it\'s unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it\'s kind of – the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our – the ability to pay for it along the way. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I\'ll let – I\'ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven\'t really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we\'re seeing some good strength in is our back office – our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn\'t full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we\'re not – we\'re certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle. But I think certainly the interim services that we\'re doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that\'s what we\'re focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the – over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we\'ve done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues – of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that\'s proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we\'re seeing some of that play through in the pipeline. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. So, but for 2017, it\'s meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, it\'s doing well on the business office services level, and we don\'t have any big expectations for the bigger deals. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I would say it\'s an upside opportunity for us as we move forward. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, that\'s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So this is Zane. I think there\'s nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we\'ll let ... Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. ... people know on that side, and I think your question will – we can address more appropriately when we get to that point. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I\'m not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I\'m just thinking about the bookings revenue, and – versus – and really more on the software side. I\'m thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can\'t remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that\'s a data point relative to the licensed software. I\'d also point out that it\'s not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that\'s actually – that\'s the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from – that\'s recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well. So, I think that\'s, for us broadly you\'ve got the – Millennium\'s a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it\'s great business, but it isn\'t – we\'re not shifting models, it\'s additive to our business. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. That\'s really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you\'re growing that, but you\'re not – there\'s not a focus on transitioning it, and you\'re not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it\'s just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you\'re doing well on the one-time software side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky\'s questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you\'ve thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it\'s still a relatively small piece of your business? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. First, I\'ll start with – Jamie, I\'ll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part – so even though we\'ve taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we\'ve added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of – we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that\'s – and they\'ve been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it\'s in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us. On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there\'s been a slow economic recovery, and we\'re encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn\'t necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there\'s a good opportunity, I\'ve spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it\'s a – it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you\'re going to – the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn\'t translate to the income statement at this point. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That\'s great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie\'s question, I don\'t think I heard the answer that – can you quantify the opportunity that you\'ve got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We don\'t... Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. ... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Sean, we\'re not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it\'s a variety of sizes of places, there\'s a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it\'s part of our normal business. It\'s not – we don\'t see that as upside to the business, that\'s part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can\'t really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. No problem. How about – on ITWorks? So what I\'m hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven\'t heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that\'s going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into – or prospects convert into deals? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the – a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There\'s a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You\'ve got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need – I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I\'m going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment. I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn\'t have those same factors, that we\'re kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right. That\'s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. This is Zane. So, I think it\'s broad-based elements. We didn\'t have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity. But I\'ll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that\'s reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. And, it\'s still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike\'s discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I\'m interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions. Now if you tie that to – and that advantage can be realized whether you\'re hosting – whether we\'re hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly. So it doesn\'t necessarily have to be cloud-based, it\'s just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn\'t be – they couldn\'t do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there\'s any update to metrics you\'ve given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Usually that\'s a – those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we\'re providing an annual guidance, we don\'t update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get – go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don\'t – we do not update those during the year. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Why don\'t we take one more question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of – this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate – revenue run rate of a "large" ITWorks contract? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. This is Marc. It\'s really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that – in our current range is, it\'s probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that\'s coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you – kind of gives you a sense of what\'s in the current base. As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we\'re talking about multiple – opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that\'s – for us that\'s kind of the next step, once we\'ve gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn\'t have a history of outsourcing. We\'re not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Zane. I\'d say there is – there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it\'s more of a run rate that\'s begun once that opportunity is completed. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it\'s all part of a ... Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. ... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can – if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. That\'s helpful. Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. I appreciate it. I know you guys have got lots to do. So, I\'ll let you go. Have a good day. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator Our first question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. And thank you for the cash flow statement, I think it\'s a welcome addition. A question relative to cash, strong cash flow this quarter, cash building on the balance sheet, we didn\'t see you in the market, although we\'ve seen you in prior Q1s. Was there anything in the market that that precluded you from repurchasing shares, or is there any thought on timing of repurchase and/or other cash activity this year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Eric, this is Marc. There wasn\'t anything the market precluding us from being in the market in the market, the timing – by the time we released Q1 and then we go into quite period for the end – when we released for the year, and then go to quiet period for Q1, it just made sense at this point that we stay on the sidelines. We still have $100 million of capacity available to us, and we would expect that to be increased appropriately as we go forward by the board. We certainly at a minimum expect to continue buybacks at a level to reduce any dilution or eliminate any dilution we get from issuing stock options, but there is nothing in the quarter other than just the timing of our quiet periods. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Very good. And one question on op expense, the level of reduction you saw this quarter, does that feel sustainable throughout the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. I think – I mean, I think op expense is certainly consistent with the plan that we had. So I think our goal will be to continue to watch spending as we do, and continue to make sure that we are managing expenses. So I don\'t think – I think the future for us will be fairly consistent. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah, hi. Thank you, and congratulations for a really good quarter. If you can just give us a little bit more detail, I think in the prepared remarks you talked about 37% of bookings outside core. So when you think about gaining share, is this mostly from some of your customers that have acquired other hospitals, or is this just a new customer base? And also if you can talk a little bit in more detail about where you\'re seeing the demand on ITWorks, I think you said you expect it to tick up in the second quarter, so if you can just provide a little bit more details on that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. So thanks for the questions, and thanks for the congratulations. The net new additions of 37%, reflects, when we say outside of our core Millennium installed base, basically is a new client setting. And a lot of the – we saw a demand across all segments of our business, so I noted a large IDN, I noted a large public entity, I noted the two outside the U.S. on the significant side, but we saw that across the community hospital marketplace, across the small marketplace. So, there was a – and that\'s kind of been a trend that we\'ve seen for the last several quarters, has been a very active replacement market for our solutions, and we\'ve seen that in terms of that percentage. As it relates to the ITWorks opportunities, we are seeing more larger opportunities coming in the pipeline than we\'ve seen, historically speaking. So, there is a there\'s both a higher number of opportunities as well as larger opportunities moving forward. So we\'re seeing the success that we\'ve had in ITWorks from an execution perspective, now reflecting up, going up-market a bit in terms of the size of opportunity that we go after – we want to go after – that we\'re going after, and that there\'s a good acceptance for. And so as we look forward into the back half of the year, we see a number of opportunities, and they\'re of a bigger size than what we\'ve seen historically. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC So, should we think about the back half really as kind of an inflection point for ITWorks? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I think what we\'re saying is, it\'s kind of we think we have an opportunity to have a record high for ITWorks, which means not only returning to our 2015 highs that we saw, but the opportunity to eclipse our 2015 bookings amounts, which would be a significant bump from where we were in 2016. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is now open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great, thanks for taking the question. I just want to follow up on Ricky\'s question. In terms of this – in the ITWorks opportunities, then you talked about going up-market to some bigger opportunities. What are clients using currently? Are they outsourcing to other, more traditional tech companies? Can you give us a sense for that competitive landscape looks there? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Most of these are in-house situations, so they\'re not typically outsourced, but they\'re looking – as I mentioned last year, there were not the same impetus in terms of the measures and mandates from a government perspective that were driving people to complete ITWorks business last year. We saw activity and we saw interest in what we were doing, but we were having a hard time moving things through the pipeline. What we\'re seeing as we move through the cycle for 2017 and beyond, is a focus on organizations looking at how can they make an impact with their own associates on their core business operations, which are truly about delivering medical care, and they\'re looking at things like the IT shop as the ways to enable that medical care, not part of their core business model. And so it\'s both the opportunity to move faster, it\'s also the execution success we\'ve had at our existing ITWorks clients in terms – and our ability to actually move faster and get better outcomes, as well as an unpredictable cost model in the future. We\'re able to bake in some of those kinds of assurances around what happens in your forward model. We\'ve done hosting for quite some time, so you think about hosting and application management, and some of the other Works businesses that we have, and we\'ve been doing that for a long time. ITWorks becomes an extension from which we\'re able to jump off of and take the rest of the client\'s business in a bigger and broader space. And we\'ve earned the confidence over time in those areas, and that\'s allowing us to have a different dialog. But I think the change from prior year to this year is we\'re seeing them – we\'re seeing the activity move forward, and you can see that they\'re getting closer in the close cycle. And I really think that\'s a reflection of people preparing for the future and some of these other measures and mandates beginning to pile up that they need help with. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That\'s helpful. And if I could just follow up on a question on RevWorks. I know you guys talked a little bit about seeing increased demand on different types of RevCycle management, and you mentioned outsourcing – sort of full outsourcing. What is some of the demand interest in that part of the market? And sort of your receptivity, how much are you moving into that direction at this point? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We have a couple of full outsourced clients today. What we are seeing is similar to the ITWorks space; people are looking for how do I, again, create scale, use Cerner scale in a different way? How do I lock in some of the cost elements as I move forward? And how do I manage through some of the changing reimbursement sides of this? And so we\'re actually seeing the activity pick up on the full outsourcing as we look forward, as well. And so good activity through the pipeline is really building on the RevWorks side. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones at Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. This is Adam Noble in for Bob. I just want to ask around population health, if you could give any updates around there on PMPM trends? And kind of the growth in risk-based lives in your platform? How have those trended? And thinking about the guidance, anything you could share around expectations for those for the course of the year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Well, I don\'t think we are releasing the PMPM elements at this point. What I would say, obviously I noted double digit, I would say those were significant double digits. So we had great, for Q1, increase over our Q1 of 2016, and we\'re looking – for the year, we\'re looking at significant double digits for the year in terms of growth in that area. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got you. That makes a lot of sense. And thinking about the margins, I think Marc you mentioned on last quarter\'s call that you expected operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year in 2017. Thinking about, what are kind of the main drivers from the 1Q baseline that you think will kind of push it back to that level, as we go through the year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Well, in Q1 we were basically flat year-over-year, and I think the biggest impact for us is the non-cash spend that we\'re going to incur in 2017, the $70 million or so uptick in that expense. So I think as projected, we expect operating margins to be relatively flat, and they were in Q1, we kind of expect that to continue this year. Obviously, we\'re pleased with the top-line growth, which allows us to grow earnings even with not realizing a lot of leverage in this year. That being said, we are not expecting us to have flat margins for the longer term. The business is designed to create leverage, and once we kind of get through some of the headwinds relative to some of the amortization of software that – we spent a lot of money on building new stuff, and as those come online, and the net (31:36) cap rate kind of declines, we should get to a point where we\'re back to looking at the 50 basis point to 100 basis point growth. I\'m not sure if we get to the top of that range in 2018, but certainly, as we start rolling forward, there is – the model has leverage in it, and we would expect to see margins grow, but in the near term, I think flat remains our expectation. Adam Noble - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks for the questions. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. Your line is now open. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Hi. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you talk a bit about the VA and also the DoD, how are things progressing with the DoD, and any update on the VA\'s process? Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thanks, David. So, the – I\'ll start with the DoD dialog. Obviously, I mentioned in my prepared comments, we had the first go-live, it\'s gone extremely well. The DoD has been a fantastic client to work with, and we are on track for the remaining three pilots as we come through the summer, for the year, and that is the initial proof-of-concept element for the DoD. And our objective is, along with our partners, is to put our head down and deliver and have it continue to go very well, and we think that positions us well for other opportunities as they come about. As you are likely aware, the VA has issued an RFI for – to basically see what elements are out there in the commercial space, they have contracted with certain third parties to help do that review, and really make a determination as to whether they look at a commercially available off-the-shelf system, or COTS system, or stay with their Vista solution today. They could go back into – so, anything beyond that is speculation. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. And then on the ambulatory side, who are you taking share from? Are you taking share, and how about like web-based vendors, such as Athena, I mean do you take share from them, just report (33:53) any thoughts around that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So we\'re taking share from all competitors, and we had another strong ambulatory quarter where we\'re taking share across all the competition. David M. Larsen - Leerink Swann & Co. Okay, great. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mohan Naidu of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks for taking my questions. Marc, quickly on the tech resale, you noted that you saw a strong tech resale quarter this year. Any particular areas you are seeing the strength in, and also do you see this becoming a tailwind in this year versus 2016, which I think was not such a great year? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, no, I think for the first time, tech resale feels like it\'s going to meet or perhaps slightly exceed our expectations, and that certainly was some of the upside that we had in this quarter. It\'s really broadly both hardware and third-party software, which is the key components of the things that we resell. But both of those did well this quarter. Certainly from my perspective, nice to have tech resale. As we\'ve talked about in the past, talked about continuing to kind of reduce our expectations of what we thought tech resale was going to do, and the ability this quarter for them to come in at a number above what we were expecting, hasn\'t happened for a while. So we\'re definitely, we\'re excited about that. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Got it. Maybe quickly on the bookings. So this quarter, without an ITWorks deal, you guys were pretty strong in bookings growth. I hear you guys talking about the strength in ITWorks pipeline and confidence in closing them. Do you need some of these deals to close to get a bookings growth for the full year? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I mean, when we do our forecasting and for the annual, we obviously take into account all the transactions that are out there. For the most part, ITWorks, based on the difficulty in exactly forecasting the timing, are fairly risk-weighted down. So I don\'t know that I would absolutely say we\'ve got to go deliver a bunch of ITWorks deals in order to get growth. Clearly, this quarter we delivered growth, with really not a lot of help from ITWorks. Q2, we\'re also not expecting a whole lot of help from ITWorks, with most of it coming kind of in the second half. So, I think that – as we go forward, I think that we certainly have some nice pipeline, we certainly expect that to contribute, but I think it\'s not dependent on delivering a bunch of ITWorks deals. Mohan Naidu - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. That\'s great. Congrats on a great start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is now open. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Afternoon, guys. I want to echo the congratulations on a nice start to the year. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Thinking more about the competitive dynamic in hospital, you had really strong performance outside your core base. As you think about the discussions being had, I know you talked about DC, but relative to what hospitals are going through and the uncertainty of ACA, relative to also just general financial pressures, how do the discussions change when you go into those large rip-and-replaces about ROI? What ROI are you able to show these customers that can prove that they can take whatever, their tens, hundreds of millions of dollars that now looks like it\'s wasted, and move your way? I\'m just trying to see how the discussion shifts in an environment where they don\'t have funding backing them up, and it\'s all based primarily on value proposition, if they ask for anything else from you? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Great question. So it\'s interesting. Each client has its own unique element, so there\'s not a total way – simple way to overly generalize, but I\'ll give you two examples. One we highlighted was the client that added the 10 additional sites, so they had Cerner in a reasonably sized chunk of their business, and they were looking to add to the portfolio. And what they\'re doing there, the justification is actually, we can consolidate our business for them, they can consolidate on a single platform, and there is more things to do, but they\'re actually seeing a hard ROI around the Cerner solution set and the capabilities that we have. And so we have implemented a number of value creation, either offices or opportunities with our clients, and almost every new business opportunity has an ROI analysis around it, and that\'s part of our charter that we work together with the clients around that ROI. And really what clients are trying to do, in the case that I mentioned of the 10 space, that\'s one where they\'re trying to standardize their operations and reduce costs overall. At the same time, they have revenue enhancements from the software that we provide, so it\'s a double positive for them. In a core, if you just think about a standalone organization, it\'s really – they\'re trying to do twofold. They\'re trying to prepare for the future, so they need a solid foundational system that will allow them to be flexible as they move forward, and give them as much comfort about the systems they\'re on, because as I mentioned previously, over half of the systems out there are not on a currently marketed solution. And so you have a lot of legacy cleanup that needs to occur. In addition to that, the ROI that we\'re able to provide, based on the Cerner solutions and it\'s unique to what we do, it helps those business cases move forward. So it\'s kind of – the conversation is really about the foundational elements as you move forward, as well as our – the ability to pay for it along the way. [06P7T1-E Michael Cherny]Great. I\'ll let – I\'ll jump back in the queue. Thanks. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good afternoon, guys, and again, congrats on a nice start to the year. Maybe specifically more on RevWorks, but you made some favorable comments in the prepared remarks Zane, but you guys have been very confident on the ITWorks portion of the business. So could you remind us what the assumptions were for RevWorks deals for this year, and just a little bit more detail as to what it needs to pick RevWorks up in the back half of the year as well? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Marc. RevWorks being the all-encompassing all-outsourcing element, we haven\'t really made any overly strong expectations of that for 2017. What we\'re seeing some good strength in is our back office – our business office services, our back office, all of the incremental services that we provide for the revenue function that isn\'t full outsourcing. There is a lot of interest in that, that business is actually doing very well. So, in that environment, we\'re not – we\'re certainly working with clients as they work their way into deciding whether they want to fully outsource on the Revenue Cycle. But I think certainly the interim services that we\'re doing is a little bit like the hosting business for an ITWorks client, it gets them some familiarity with how we do things, some comfort level in our skill sets. And I think that\'s what we\'re focusing on for the most part on the Revenue Cycle. Once again, working with one of our premier clients, is of significant size and delivering a great experience and an example through them that we can then take to the industry. But I think certainly as we look our bookings opportunities, ITWorks and the number and size of opportunities is a much closer opportunity to us than RevWorks. Zane? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. One element that we have seen, which is why I referenced it in the prepared comments, is the pipeline for full outsourcing is something that we are seeing. We are seeing an activity and interest in the pipeline. And so I would look at that as, not necessarily a significant element to contribute to 2017, but as we move beyond that time period and into the – over the long term, I think it provides some really great long-term opportunities. Some things that we\'ve done on an individual basis is, every new business opportunity that sells Revenue Cycle today has some proportion of a revenues – of a RevWorks services offering. So we get people started on our offerings. And I think that\'s proving to be a really great model for creation of businesses in the future, and we\'re seeing some of that play through in the pipeline. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. So, but for 2017, it\'s meeting your modest expectations to date, three quarters in? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, it\'s doing well on the business office services level, and we don\'t have any big expectations for the bigger deals. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Got it. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I would say it\'s an upside opportunity for us as we move forward. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay, that\'s very helpful. And then a quick follow-up was, at Investor Day I thought that there was some commentary on selecting a CRM partner to fulfill I think it was a variety of front-end activities and some patient outreach, I think, so could you elaborate on where you are in that process? And I guess more importantly, what will that allow you to do, or do better, and where would we see the impact of that partnership in the financials? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. So this is Zane. I think there\'s nothing really to discuss at this point in time, and so when there is we\'ll let ... Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. ... people know on that side, and I think your question will – we can address more appropriately when we get to that point. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks again. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper of SunTrust. Your line is now open. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Thanks very much. Just a quick question, I\'m not sure Marc if you have a way to sort of encapsulate this. But I\'m just thinking about the bookings revenue, and – versus – and really more on the software side. I\'m thinking about the mix between recurring software and one-time software. Is that coming in fairly consistently? I can\'t remember off the top of my head what you talked about in terms of that at the Investor Day in 2016, but just how to think about sort of, are we continuing to see the shift, and how dramatic is the shift going towards recurring software versus the one-time software? Any commentary or color around that would be really appreciated. Thanks. Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Well, I think we talked about, of our licensed software, about 30% of it is SaaS. So I think that\'s a data point relative to the licensed software. I\'d also point out that it\'s not really a shift. We continue to sell one-time software, continue to sell licenses, that\'s actually – that\'s the bulk of our business, doing that. But what we are seeing is that the additive elements of our business, the IT that we are selling as a service or on a subscription basis, is continuing to ramp up. That number as the revenue number continues to be strong, and the percent of that from – that\'s recurring in nature, we expect that to continue to ramp up as well. So, I think that\'s, for us broadly you\'ve got the – Millennium\'s a license, HealtheIntent is primarily the SaaS-based, along with some of the Cerner Works and the ambulatory cloud solutions that we offer. But key for us is, it\'s great business, but it isn\'t – we\'re not shifting models, it\'s additive to our business. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. That\'s really helpful. So, just to sort of summarize that you\'re growing that, but you\'re not – there\'s not a focus on transitioning it, and you\'re not thinking of each year growing the SaaS and shrinking the other personally (46:34), it\'s just how things shake out, and right now it looks to be fairly consistent because you\'re doing well on the one-time software side? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Correct. Sandy Y. Draper - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Stockton of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi, yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of quick ones for Zane, as a follow-up to I think Ricky\'s questions earlier. Could you just give us a ballpark for the number of facilities that are not on Millennium, that your existing clients currently own today? I think in the past you\'ve thrown out a number around 300, is it still around there? And then the second one, international, yeah FX was a headwind during the quarter, it sounds like maybe tech resale was weak there, but can you just kind of paint a picture for us of what you think that international business is going to do over the next two or three years? Can we see it reaccelerate, maybe a mid-teens growth rate, because it seems like it\'s still a relatively small piece of your business? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. First, I\'ll start with – Jamie, I\'ll start with the first piece. The number of actually opportunities has actually grown, because we continue to add more clients, and so we have more clients as part – so even though we\'ve taken elements out, like the 10 sites this quarter, we continue to add additional clients, and we\'ve added more clients in the last eight quarters than any time in history of the company. And so you look at a couple of – we have some really significant opportunities with many of our largest clients in that side, and that\'s – and they\'ve been nothing, but net acquirers, also, over this time. So when we talked about the 300, I would just tell you, it\'s in excess of that number at this point in time, and has actually continued to grow as an opportunity size for us. On the international business, we believe that that business will grow, that as there\'s been a slow economic recovery, and we\'re encouraged actually by the bookings results, it hasn\'t necessarily shown up on the income statement yet to date. And so I think there\'s a good opportunity, I\'ve spent a fair amount of my time in the global market outside the U.S., and I think it\'s a – it represents a growth opportunity for us over the mid-range and long-range term. And I think you\'re going to – the front, early indicator of that is both obviously, the pipeline is very strong, and so our global pipeline is at an all-time high, our bookings were very solid for the quarter from global, it just didn\'t translate to the income statement at this point. Jamie Stockton - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. That\'s great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Wieland of Piper Jaffray. Your line is still open. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hi, thanks, and so just to follow up on Jamie\'s question, I don\'t think I heard the answer that – can you quantify the opportunity that you\'ve got, of health system customers that still have a significant number of sites on legacy systems? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. We don\'t... Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. ... is there are a dollar value, you can assign to that? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, Sean, we\'re not going to assign a dollar value for it. I mean, it\'s a variety of sizes of places, there\'s a variety of things that go into it, but the fact that an existing client that already has our footprint, and we have that number of facilities to which we have the opportunity to extend, it\'s part of our normal business. It\'s not – we don\'t see that as upside to the business, that\'s part of our normal approach and a normal view of the world as we look and do our forecasting, but we can\'t really give you a dollar number as to what that means. Sorry. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. No problem. How about – on ITWorks? So what I\'m hearing is that it seems like the dry spell is coming to an end, maybe not by the second quarter, but certainly into the second half. But what I haven\'t heard is some specific factors, either internal to Cerner or external in the market, that\'s going to cause this, what appears to be healthy pipeline of ITWorks deals, convert into – or prospects convert into deals? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah. So, I may not have eloquently said it, but what I would tell you is that the factors that are changing is the – a little bit of the unsettledness around what happens in the future actually helps us in this space, as well as some of the government regulations that were on pause for 2016, which come into play in 2017. There\'s a number of factors that really impact what I think was a kind of a pause for 2016. So I think really the factors that were there previously that had fueled good growth in the ITWorks business, I think is really more of a return to the pre-2016 era of, you have measures and mandates from government. You\'ve got increased concern over costs. You have increased focus on: I need – I should focus my associates on things that matter. So as a health system, I\'m going to focus my people on the pieces that really matter, which is providing care, and thinking about how I make money in a future of healthcare in that environment. I really think 2016 was a bit of a pause, because margins were actually pretty good across our client base. There was no measures and mandates, no meaningful use element in 2016. And so, you just didn\'t have those same factors, that we\'re kind of back to where we were in 2015 from that perspective. So I really look at it and say, 2017 is more of the normal, where we thought we would be; what we missed was 2016 being a pause. Sean W. Wieland - Piper Jaffray & Co. All right. That\'s helpful. Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Gillmor of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a follow-up on the revenue performance. It seems like licensed software was the other key driver relative to expectations. Just curious if there was any additional commentary you could provide, were there any particularly large deals that came through, or was it more broad-based? And then also from a product mix standpoint on licensed software, was there more contribution from the RevCycle software or more on the EHR? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. This is Zane. So, I think it\'s broad-based elements. We didn\'t have any single transaction that drove licensed software in a significant way, it was actually the volume of transactions; the amount of new business wins were significant. Revenue Cycle was significant in all of those elements, both from an installed base as well as our new business opportunity. But I\'ll actually say, we got a little bit of bump on our new business side from a licensed software perspective. And having some of those larger opportunities, and winning at those larger opportunities, you tend to have a little bit bigger software pieces. So the ones that I mentioned were more significant, but I think that\'s reflective of what we see in the marketplace. But there was not any single transaction that made a big difference there. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. And, it\'s still broad-based, still significant sales back into the base. But really no one solution or no specific groups of solutions were notably bigger than the others. Matthew D. Gillmor - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Got it. Thanks for taking the question. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Garro of William Blair & Company. Your line is now open. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Good afternoon, guys and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to touch on Mike\'s discussion on Cerner Advance and continuous availability. If I\'m interpreting that correctly, it seems tied to cloud capabilities and remote hosting. So maybe you could update us on the overall penetration of hosting services, and how we should think about whether clients are adopting hosting so that they can take advantage of these additional capabilities, or if they are adopting hosting on a standalone value proposition, and then discovering everything else that they can do to their benefit? Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. So this is Mike. Actually, they are related topics, but there are some distinctions between the two as well. Cerner Advance was really developed to allow us to capture data at a very granular level about the use of our system, and then through our analytics, we can then drive back, in across the entire client base, recommendations for improving the use and effectiveness of our solutions. Now if you tie that to – and that advantage can be realized whether you\'re hosting – whether we\'re hosting the system for them or not. But if we look at our hosting capabilities today, probably 75% to 80% of our clients run out of our data center, and all new deals are within that model. And you are correct that we do have an advantage when we run those systems, we have the ability to keep our clients current, refresh their software more easily with less effort, and allow them to drive the value more quickly. So it doesn\'t necessarily have to be cloud-based, it\'s just a fact that now by operating within our environment we can do things that maybe wouldn\'t be – they couldn\'t do on their own. So it is a huge advantage that we leverage significantly. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC Great, and if I can squeeze one in for Marc, wanted to ask if there\'s any update to metrics you\'ve given before on revenue visibility, like the percentage growth needed from bookings for the year or amount of revenue for the remainder of the year coming from backlog that enhances your visibility on the forward outlook? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. Yeah. Usually that\'s a – those are data points, Jeff, that we provide at the beginning of the year to kind of give you a sense when we\'re providing an annual guidance, we don\'t update those throughout the year. Obviously when you get – go from a 12-month view to a 90-day view, your visibility is a higher percent than we would have talked about coming from backlog earlier, but we don\'t – we do not update those during the year. Jeff R. Garro - William Blair & Co. LLC No problem. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Sure. Why don\'t we take one more question? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Donald Hooker of KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Great, good afternoon. I was curious when you talk about large ITWorks in the pipeline, if you could help kind of size what that means, and in terms of – this might be a tough question to answer, because I know it will range widely, but what is the typical run rate – revenue run rate of a "large" ITWorks contract? Marc Naughton - Cerner Corp. This is Marc. It\'s really hard to give you an average, because we have 25 clients now, and they even range within their universe, and that is probably 25 clients that are kind of at the lower end. I mean, if you were looking kind of what our current clients in that – in our current range is, it\'s probably $20 million a year, which includes not only their ITWorks components, but all the revenue that\'s coming from that client, which would be licensed software, support, all the elements, because we combine all those. Once an ITWorks deal is done, the ITWorks team owns that client regardless where the revenue is coming from. So, that gives you – kind of gives you a sense of what\'s in the current base. As we look forward, you have some that are that size, you have some that could be five times that size. So the opportunity, when we talk about bigger ones, we\'re talking about multiple – opportunities that could be multiples bigger from an annual revenue standpoint, when you do this all-inclusive view. So that\'s – for us that\'s kind of the next step, once we\'ve gotten the standalone or smaller clients, trying to move it upscale. And as Zane said, the current environment of people focusing on cost is making them consider doing an outsourcing, where they might not have before. Once again, why the industry really doesn\'t have a history of outsourcing. We\'re not going in to compete against an existing outsourcer. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. And when you win these deals, it takes time for that revenue to kick in, I understand. How late this year is a sort of a cut-off for deals sort of impacting 2018, as we start thinking about ITWorks possibly rebounding in 2018? Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Yeah, this is Zane. I\'d say there is – there are implications in the current quarter of signing, so you do see positive earnings and revenue from ITWorks in the quarter they sign. Obviously it depends on what point in the quarter that has does happen. But it\'s more of a run rate that\'s begun once that opportunity is completed. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. Usually these deals you sign and rebadge simultaneously, because it\'s all part of a ... Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. Okay. Michael R. Nill - Cerner Corp. ... communication process. So really the month you sign it, is the first month of that sequential revenue comes. So, you can – if you sign stuff in Q2 and Q3, it will have a fairly full Q impact beginning in the next quarter. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. Right. Donald H. Hooker - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc. That\'s helpful. Thank you. Zane M. Burke - Cerner Corp. I want to thank everyone for being on the call today. I appreciate it. I know you guys have got lots to do. So, I\'ll let you go. Have a good day. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\'s conference. That does conclude today\'s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.

Bernstein Strategic Decisions Conference 2017 May 31, 2017 04:00 PM ET Executives Mark Alles - Chief Executive Officer Analysts Ronny Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein Ronny Gal Thank you very much for making it. My first introduction to Mark was when I showed up at the breakout session that the Company had at J. P. Morgan. And even then the name says on and was raising about how evil the men at the CBM are. And I could be opposite position that we got into an argument, and gets everybody around the table again to look at them, we decided that why are you arguing with them, which made me turn around and asked him, hi, I’m Ronny Gal, do you want to say. And at least I knew who I was at that point, but we also learned that Seals and Marine officer before early in his carrier and having served in a similar unit can certainly appreciate the feistiness that comes from -- that come back on. Based on the Celgene preference, we’re going to start with a short statement by Mark about where the Company is today. And then I'm going to start through Q&A that kind of go through the major franchise and ask some general questions. And happy to take questions, there are cards on the table, please feel free to pass them on and somebody will come from the back and take them up. In the end of the 45-50 minutes we’ve got, I'm going to talk couple of things before end and see if anybody wants to just get out and ask questions directly. And if that’s okay, Mark thank you for being here. Mark Alles Thanks. I'm not surprised though that we have a military background that we shutdown and we had an argument about something that we really agreed on, but had a different perspective about the value creation, so really great to be with you today. Mark Alles, I'm the CEO of Celgene. I've been with the Company for 13.5 years. So through a period of I think explosive growth, and I just wanted to remind investors before we start the Q&A, that the Company is mission driven. We focus on some key thoughts and key principles that we built the Company around and continue to build the Company around and that is that especially in a world of Managed Care, a world of cost effectiveness and the paired environment, we look to discover, develop and commercialize those innovative therapies, in other words, innovation gets thrown around a lot incremental versus clear difference. But innovation where a high unmet medical needs in cancer and increasingly, we talk about inflammation, but it's really immunology. We’re looking to discover, develop and commercialize those medicines that make a huge difference for the actual patients with serious diseases. In that context, we are most known as a hematology company; so a blood cancer company in myeloma, lymphoma, leukemia, et cetera and a portfolio of market leading drugs in myeloma and increasingly other areas of blood cancers. Our solid tumor franchise is really led by ABRAXANE, a drug that is one of the very few drugs that has ever produced the survival advantage for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. This is also a product that physicians right now in the I/O revolution, the checkpoint inhibitor revolution in combination with PDL1 for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. So some data should be coming soon that tells us whether that combination is important or not for lung cancer. When we think about what else is happening in our portfolio, we move quickly to our inflammatory franchise. In the last two years, we’ve turned Otezla, our drug for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, into a bonafide blockbuster. We positioned it before Biologics, this was a lot running if you remember our discussion about the payer, a lot of that was positioning pre-biologic and then its investors took notice to Otezla in the first quarter, we actually had a significant impact on the performance of the brand, but more mechanically than fundamentally, that is that at the end of the 2016, we executed contracts with some of the major insurance Managed Care plans in the U.S. that caused the associated gross to net change on the rebates that we provided. So this gave us access in a biological step free environment, meaning there was not a requirement for patient to be exposed to a biologic for psoriasis or for arthritis before they would be eligible for an Otezla script. So this was an important access step for the brand and we increased the covered universe by about 100 million lives of people who would have step free access to the product. This is a bonafide blockbuster and I can tell you coming out of Q1 into Q2, we've seen a nice volume recovery, we've seen the prescription volume in the market in the U.S. grow, and we're launching right now in Japan and across Europe. So a lot of momentum for Otezla despite a little bit of weakness in the first quarter. We also affirmed our guidance for the year for Otezla $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, so year-on-year great performance and a lot of momentum for the brand. Importantly, what we've been able to do over the last three or four year years is build out our inflammatory franchise to include what we believe is arguably one of the best portfolios in the world for inflammatory bowel diseases. So beginning with GED-301 or oligonucleotide that is only absorbed in the colon, and we've had some Phase II data for the product that's in Phase III now for Crohn's Disease. We think that’s an enormous opportunity and we'll wait to see what the data say and then we have high hopes for it commercially. About 22 months ago, we acquired Receptos for $7.2 billion net of cash to bring ozanimod into our portfolio. And two Mondays ago, we announced the second of two Phase III trials that were very positive for the drug in the setting of relapsed multiple sclerosis. So we're quite excited about that. We're anxious for investors and the community at large to see the data. We would submit the data to an academic meeting that will likely happen in the October timeframe. We're targeting certain meetings, but you never know exactly which meeting will pick up the abstract. We hope it’s extreme to speak at MS meeting in Europe that happens in late October. We're very, very excited about the data. And in fact the results of the two Phase III trials separately and together for relapsing MS put the product at a profile that is better than the base case we had when we did the deal to acquire the asset. The other thing that's happened with ozanimod is that we have proof of concept data, Phase II proof of concept data that we just got for Crohn's disease. So we have another disease category for ozanimod that will go Phase III at the end of the year. And that's on the back of ulcerative colitis where if we think about the deal model that's really where we put a lot of the value for this unique molecular entity ozanimod. So when I think about those molecules and the inflammatory bowel disease opportunity, when we model it, we easily see an opportunity to replace and offset a lot of what would be loss of revenue from the patent cliff into the next decade from lenalidomide to pomalidomide and then ABRAXANE. So we have a nice virtuous cycle of our portfolio playing out. Our second quarter momentum is quite good. So our first quarter, you might remember, we performed quite nicely year-on-year top line grew 18%, bottom line grew 27%. We see that momentum continuing very nicely in the second quarter. So our full year outlook feels very, very good. We have ASCO this weekend, which is the major cancer conference. We've got some data that will be presented there that reinforces the value proposition of our products in hematology and somewhat in oncology. We're excited about that. And I think this year is going to turn out to be one of the best years. We have a significant number of catalysts, I mentioned ozanimod in MS, but this year, we've accrued multiple Phase III trials and have read-outs of another series of Phase III trials. For example, with ABRAXANE, we have an early stage pancreatic cancer trial that is curative intent. These are patients who have a resection of their localized tumor. When they recover, they go to chemotherapy or no treatment. So it's intensive cure. We should see the result of that trial towards the end of the year and that would add substantially to our opportunity for ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer, and on and on and on. In our pipeline, we now have 14 molecules that we believe have the opportunity to be approved before 2021. Of those 14, nine to 10 of them are $1 billion products. Of the nine to 10, four of them have multi-billion dollar potential. And these are risk adjusted bottom up use of what the products can be. Overall, in our research portfolio, we have 50 programs, 50 molecules, these supported by 100 different clinical programs. Through the very virtuous environment we've reaffirmed our outlook for 2020 multiple times. We see ourselves growing from a top-line this year of between $13 billion and $13.4 billion to over $21 billion by 2020, and the bottom line growing from this range of $7.15 to $7.30 this year to more than $13 a share in 2020; so a lot of momentum; a lot of catalysts are intact; a lot of optionality is been built into the portfolio; and this is all on a business model with an operating margin that averages right around 55%. So thank you for being here today. I look forward to talking about Celgene, the industry, anything that's on your mind. So Ronnie thank you for the chance to intro Celgene and we can get started. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Ronny Gal Sure. So I noticed that our first conversation going back to the Washington back, you seem to have a pretty clear idea of how you think the market will change, maybe not the final answer, the couple of steps from the long way. Can you give us a feel for what do you feel particularly strong about how things will change? Mark Alles So I feel very strongly that there is political knowledge and willpower to think about things like access and affordability not as a pricing issue by itself, where pharma companies are being singled out as the reason that access and affordability for especially those cancer medicines and other medicines that have a high development cost, a higher risk premium attached to them. I think there is a lot of knowledge that the end-to-end cost is something that the politicians the world around us, is beginning to understand, and wants to do things, for example, based contracting. That is indication specific outcome where we could take a molecule contract with payers and actually have for differentiated outcomes, differentiated reimbursements. So we think that's an important principle that's getting a lot of attention around the world. Those kinds of things are available, but they're not available yet in the U.S. And I think there is an awareness that they need to become more available. I think the payers are looking to do that as well. The PBMs insurers, they would love to engage in these relationships. But that's not available to us yet in the U.S. So I think that's one example. I think the other example that's very clear are these contracts that create an absolute problem in terms of access for patients where the co-pay can be 30% to 50% of the cost of a monthly prescription. Where for a medically necessary medicine, where it may be the only thing that will help a patient, they're paying more out of pocket for the monthly prescription than they would if they had a cardiac procedure that was inpatient in the hospital. And the distinction is that in the hospitalized setting, the patient is not exposed to the co-pay. But it's much more expensive and less cost effective in many sense than a medicine with the exposure that the patient is realizing is what everyone is focused on. We need to think about flat or some rational way to think about out of pocket expenses, co-pay coinsurance, whatever in the context of life saving medicine that keeps people out of the hospital, which are more cost effective than a surgical procedure or an in-patient procedure cost a lot more but no one sees the out of pocket expense. These are things that people are paying a lot of attention to and I think there's a lot of willpower politically to figure out better ways of sharing that burden and creating access and affordability across the spectrum. Ronny Gal I hear you. Let's say the first one for a second. So obviously the best example here is the anti-TNF market and the ability to price for volume across multiple disease area. But it eventually blocks you if you have a great molecule for one of the condition. There are two outcomes to what you say system that gets implemented first. You have a split down the middle in innovative industry what so called innovative industry, where companies work to establish franchises that run for very long time? I'm going to take opposite position to companies that have novel molecules. And the second one is that you have to have some government regulation of commercial agreement, which seems very difficult with a Republican administration. So help me understand how we get there. You're talking about system where you’re trying to do a system reform when half of your industry is going to object to this. And to some extent, there's no easy path to implement. So can you guys give me a couple of steps in the middle how we get there? Mark Alles I think what we're talking about at macro level is a regulatory reform picture. So what are we able to do from a regulatory point of view? That is instead of pricing a medicine by SKU or presentation of the product; you look at that medicine and in the context of looking at outcome for disease X versus disease Y; pricing would be improved or not, reimbursement would be improved or not; based on the therapeutic outcome compared to a number of considerations; a regulatory environment that would be encouraging that is something that I think is very doable. And it's hard to argue against the regulatory environment that supports better reimbursement for better outcomes. Ronny Gal So you almost, you almost stating that you would be -- you said you'll be in favor of an organization that will actually evaluate the benefits of the drug based on some sort of economical value. In general the drug industry pulls that like… Mark Alles No, in a simple way, in a simplistic way, that happens every day all the time. It’s just creating a regulatory framework where it's totally appropriate for multiple parties to decide what that outcome looks like in a free market environment. We're talking about the U.S. So creating that opportunity is really simply looking at regulation in a slightly different way. And I don't think there's opposition to that. I think that most people would say, for example, a generic drug that's pennies on the dollar, and by the way 80% of the prescriptions in the United States are for generic, 90% are for generic drugs, so system does that already. This would be in the context of, for example, looking at reimbursement at some level, private and/or governmental reimbursement, and having an ability to say a drug that does exit one disease using some framework for objective evaluation of that outcome that you could actually charge more or get reimbursed more for those outcomes versus if you have incremental benefit and for a tiny fraction, you might have some benefit or you don't get used at all. So this would also help research and development, because the fact is lifecycle management and looking at the cost of developing drugs, if you know that they're differentiated reimbursement schemes for differentiated outcomes that would direct a lot of R&D in a different way. Ronny Gal I can really see the benefit, the development of pomalidomide, it sounds like a very difficult idea to implement in practice unless you have an ability to like eye for saying this drug is evaluated for X in this indication and this drug is evaluated for Y in this indication? Mark Alles So you say eye serve, but it could be any framework. And that's what I mean by regulatory before. When we develop molecules and submit dockets through the confident regulatory authorities around the world, there is a framework for how a drug and safety is reviewed. So having a reimbursement framework in a private public market situation that allows for free market development of products, pricing that would be in a free market setting, but then based on cost effectiveness or outcomes differentiated reimbursement, that's something that’s very doable, very, very doable. You just need the regulatory framework for that to happen. I'm not saying it’s simple and I'm not saying we’re ready for it but I think value based contracting and value based pricing is a way to deal with the economics that we've been struggling with. Let's take the cancer market and everyone in the room can identify with the cancer market. The cost of cancer therapy is not the issue. It's the cost of failure. So let's take the current excitement about the immunotherapy class of drugs, PD-1, PDL-1. If we take the totality of the results of all the studies that have happened, and some have been remarkable, checkpoint inhibitors will replace chemotherapy, it's really incredible. But when you look at the totality, less than half of the patients who are getting checkpoint inhibitors today by data are achieving meaningful clinical durable benefit. I think people can argue, but wouldn't argue too much against that. But we're still treating 100 patients to find the 50 who might do really well. There was a great outcome at FDA last week where FDA with Merck approved a broad-based indication for Keytruda that was based on the biomarker as opposed to the tissue of origin for the cancer. I think that's a great outcome -- it's a way to think about future in terms of biomarkers across a disease category as opposed to tumor-by-tumor. So I think that was wonderful. But the cost of failure is what is so problematic. That's why we're excited about, for example, in our own portfolio, a drug from our partner Agios, we call it, Idifa, AG-221 was the old name -- IDH2 drug, and it's for a subset of acute myeloid leukemia, one of the most lethal cancers known to man. Patients with this mutation have recently been identified as subjects for therapeutic intervention and that's the drug now Idifa. It's going to be approved with the companion diagnostics. So you can imagine that the opportunity for us to price it in a value orientation where we partner with payers, we partner with diagnostic and we put it in a market where only those patients who truly can benefit should get it, and we commercialize it only that way. It takes the cost effectiveness equation turns it on a tad and makes it totally cost effective. Compared with for example, today, how IDH2 mutated AML patients are treated in a group of patients with either first or second line AML. And this goes on multiples of times in the cancer market across every disease category. The cost of failure is what we can afford. So figuring out a regulatory framework where more homogeneity, more contracting for outcome is endorsed and allowed, is something that there is a lot of willpower for it. I'm not saying again it's going to happen tomorrow, but that's a wave I think that's coming. And by the way around the world, there are lots of examples of it in other market. So I think it's just a question of when not if. Ronny Gal It's just a time regulatory approval to value assessment, and then I think it's going to similar to other countries around the world. Most drug companies will find really, really challenging. This is still a best market… Mark Alles I am not talking about the free market environment where the Company has the ability to price in a free market environment. What I'm saying is if you're able to engage whether it's Medicare or take or payer and engage in a negotiation about the value of the medicine and then reimbursement of whatever price you want to set that environment is coming in some way that's here today. Ronny Gal Well we can discuss this longer to different setting. But I hear you about the direction at which this market will go. Let's talk a little bit about where Celgene is going. So one of the things you started was this discussion of we will go through the REVLIMID and also exclusivity between 23 and 25. And you've got a great drug in REVLIMID, hugely successful, helps a lot of patients. But no company has ever grown through that size of a patent loss. Now you guys -- you actually have a decade to think about it. And it seems one element of the strategy is we're going to use our catalyst to buy anything that looks really promising in areas where we have competencies. It seems like the other elements of the strategy should be -- and we will also buyback a lot of shares, and we will keep our options open to do something with REVLIMID to separate it from the rest of the business, somewhere towards the end of the life, so you can see the value of the core business. Can you help us understand a little bit about the other element of the strategy, should we expect them? And if so when you're going to be able to discuss? Mark Alles So I came this afternoon to announce our entire M&A -- you're exactly right that we are in a window where REVLIMID represents a lot of the success for the Company; it's concentrated revenue; it has a tremendous margin; it throws off a lot of free cash flow; and we're using that opportunity to lifecycle and build the Company. In fact, it's how it would seem to be; it's how we did the Ozanimod deal with Receptos; it's how in part we were able to acquire ABRAXANE. And then when you look at our partnership network, a lot of our reach into the world of partnership comes from this wonderful hematology franchise that we’ve built. We have patent hill not a patent cliff. So when you think about our future, you’re right to say that we have a 10 year window before we're fully exposed to a generic market for [multiple speakers] because we structure the arrangement, the settlement, such that in the beginning of 2022 -- now Teva, is limited to a mid-single digit volume of generic lenalidomide. And that grows out to 2025 to no more than 30% of the volume of lenalidomide in the market. And in 2026, we have the full generic entrance. So we do have a lot of time. We, as I said at the beginning, have already built the pipeline of line of sight to 14 molecules with different approval dates between now and 2021. If I just look at the inflammatory bowel disease franchise and I look at the three products Otezla, Ozanimod, GED-301, in a mix of puts and takes on thinking about success there, all of those molecules with the potential to launch before or around 2020 that revenue alone that opportunity alone can offset all of not the annual REVLIMID sales, but whatever the peak is this is a replacement for. And remember the hill, means I don't have to replace it all at once. This is the difference between how most people think about patent cliff and how this is structured right now from a settlement point of view. We have a window to incrementally increase our outlook while we decrease what we see coming from REVLIMID. And mathematically and from a modeling point of view with our pipeline, our current portfolio share buybacks and continuing to deploy capital aggressively to build the Company through partnerships and other M&A, we do believe we would be one of the first companies that could grow through a dominant products patent expiry. Again, it's a patent hill not a cliff. Ronny Gal So let's talk about -- so all this is going to -- this is all going to be de-risked become evident as we go through. You think about the 12 month, I think you mentioned one key milestone, and that would be ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. What are the other like key de-risking events, key milestone events, between now and the end of the year just make it easy? Mark Alles So we just had a major de-risking event, and let me just take a second on Ozanimod. It is unfortunate that on the one hand we were clear about the results of the two Phase III trials on the other hand, it was important to point out what is actually the fourth ranked secondary endpoint in the Phase III clinical trials, which is the disability index. That had a lot of investor interest and we understand why. With Gileniya assumed to go generic in '19, it was important to be clear on did we versus Gileniya have a statistically positive outcome on that endpoint. But it was the fourth secondary endpoint that also represents clinically and in the market how important or not that is in terms of the product profile. So we have dataset that we're very excited about and want to present as soon as we can that will come later in the year. As I said and I'll repeat now, we see the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE data presenting us with optionality in multiple sclerosis that in our base case, we saw as a risky event. We're sitting here today believing we have the therapeutic value from a molecule that allows us to consider and we will very likely build another franchise around neurosciences. So this is an anchor molecule that presents for us the opportunity to become a player in a number of dimensions of neurosciences. That's how sure we are about the molecule today. When we presented it academically, I hope you'll invite me back and we can talk about the totality of the dataset as opposed to a press release and the top-line data from the two Monday's ago. That is an enormous de-risking event. The other part of de-risking is the Phase II proof of concept data for Crohn’s. We now have another molecule that we can move into advanced phase development for Crohn’s disease, which is an enormous unmet medical need with multi multi-billion dollar potential for an active state drug. And then of course, we already know about ulcerative colitis, the maintenance figure were quite positive that's where we got comfortable that the cardiac profile was different than Gileniya, albeit it in a different disease state. So we add this up and we've had a massive de-risking event on the biggest M&A transaction we've had in the history of the Company that sets us. When I think about the core business, where we are executing on the REVLIMID maintenance launch, I think about where Otezla is in its current performance. So that the core business that we have, we've been able to do better quarter-after-after for multiple years in a row in a way that gives us the strength to continue on the business development side as we have. So we don't necessarily talk about the core business as a de-risking event, but it absolutely is. We had a tremendous Q1, Q2 halfway through looks fantastic, the year looks good. That means that as we think about 2020 and beyond, we’re stronger than what we thought our profile was in our existing business, that's a massive de-risking approach. For ABRAXANE, we talked about the pancreatic trials. We don't know the data. We talked about the I/O, we don't know the data. So we'll see what happens as a de-risking. But throughout the balance of the year, we're also fully accruing clinical trials. So let me give you two examples from a portfolio; yesterday, we finished accruing a trial of CC-46. Remember, we have a drug called VIDAZA internationally, that's still patented that generates $600 million a year and it's the only drug that is an alternative for high risk MDS and a subset of AML. So in the U.S., it's generic now but in Europe, it's still generating $100 million in revenue. We have an oral form of this drug CC-46. We completed the accrual of a very important study, called AML-001. These are patients who get into remission, which is rare for AML patients. And the randomization is placebo as the control arm versus 46% as experimental arm, it's a maintenance strategy. So we think REVLIMID maintenance after transplant that's what we're trying to do in AML. So that trial is now fully accrued. It would be a very novel strategy and CC-46 has the potential not only to be a maintenance drug in AML, but a drug for AML. And importantly, we have information that's been published we're at prime as in epigenetic drug, as a precursor to checkpoint inhibitors. So there is some synergy and a primary effect that may play out to help checkpoint inhibitors to work better. And we're testing that theory in diseases like ovarian cancer for patients who get platinum therapy, do not progress with measurable disease, they progresses with what’s called CA-125. And that biomarker driven approach is where we put CC-46 before they get a checkpoint inhibitor. So we're testing this drug in a number of very important immunologic conditions. And there’s luspatercept this is a drug from our partnership with Acceleron. We finished accruing for a low risk NDS population. This study we are very excited about, because this is not only proof of concept in patients who are transfusion dependent but it's also way to think about luspatercept more broadly in any setting where anemia is problematic, and where EPO may or may not be a therapeutic choice. So it is an NDS treatment today, but we have no idea where this mechanism could take us in the future. So that's a study that's fully accrued that puts luspatercept in that 14 molecules with multi-billion potential, so that's just a standpoint of de-risking and excitement. Ronny Gal So one of the things that's interesting. So CC-46 you mentioned you accrued the AML trial. Remind us that nothing ever worked in AML in maintenance setting in a significant way, and this is comparing to the NDS trial the same molecule that's probably the more the riskier program? Mark Alles So Ronny, let me appreciate your point and make sure we amplify it. Maintenance strategies for blood cancers have largely been ineffective. There are two scenarios where it's worked really well, REVLIMID maintenance post transplant in myeloma and RITUXAN in follicular lymphoma. So two scenarios -- but other scenarios that the problem with AML and nothing has ever worked is patients are so sick that they rapidly progress to death. So even if you get an incomplete remission, it's such a short live remission that nothing has been effective to hold that remission before they break through and die. We know that from Idifa, we know that from VIDAZA. So this is a strategy that is a risky strategy but since VIDAZA works well in AML, we thought it made sense to take mechanism of the drug and oral form and test it in the setting. So it would be risky, but we think it's worth the risk. Ronny Gal So one of the things that I kind of learn is I was looking at the Company is the value of those maintenance programs. So this is the multi-year use of the drugs for years and years is what's driving the expansion of the REVLIMID franchise. So I hear about luspatercept, but one of the questions of luspatercept is. Should I think about this as a drug, which is priced roughly versus the people franchise or the RNS franchise, or something that's priced against other oncology assets in the high end of innovation? Mark Alles So, we're not looking at pricing outside of a cancer treatment market. So we don't know yet what the pricing would be, but right now it's an intervention for low risk transfusion dependent MDS patient. The point I'm making is that once you have that outcome, anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion. So I want to be careful that we're not thinking about this as some areas or EPO, but the mechanism and anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion with a positive result in a low risk MDS market. Ronny Gal Make sense. The other question is kind of more broadly question for… Mark Alles Can I just -- one thing before we move on, I think the audience heard you talked about durability, maintenance and duration as a driver. I think this is very important point. So back to value back to outcomes where pricing maintenance therapy for different medicines the same as acute treatment today. You get my point? So medicine that's approved to maintain the benefit of other therapy, transplants this or that, the pricing today by regulatory structure has to be the same. Ronny Gal Good point. Why is that? Mark Alles Because that's the regulatory framework. We would absolutely be encouraged there’s an industry to look at alternative strategies for R&D about how to maintain the benefit or treat patients differently if the acute setting to control a disease, like cancer, was treated from a reimbursement perspective differently than maintaining the benefit of something else. So I wanted to use that example because we are in fact advantaged as a Company by the duration effect of the medicines that we have for cancer that control the disease extraordinarily long, and that's a big value driver for the Company. Ronny Gal So the question that comes here is that you're talking little bit about the double edged sword. So in one way, you're charging now somewhere between $130,000 and $160,000 for annual treatment with REVLIMID at the full dose on an ongoing basis. So the value here that you got a drug that worked for four-five-six if you had DARA seven-eight years potentially. And so the value per patient exceeds a million. Now if you allow the system to break away that compromise you just discussed, you might end up in a situation where those outer years, the value that you get per year of treatment, would drop dramatically versus getting the disease under control. Mark Alles So let's be clear what we're talking about. The economics of healthcare are not going to get better. Across the world and in the U.S., if you look at the discretionary spending economically, the proportion of discretionary spending that goes to healthcare is growing so rapidly, it's not drug pricing that's doing it. It's the totality of what we spend. Let's use some numbers, so that we're all together. The estimate this year is that healthcare spending in the U.S. direct is approaching $3.5 trillion. Some people think it might be as high as $4 trillion. Let's just pick $3.5 trillion, because off of last year, which was more $3 trillion, we're in the range. Obesity alone of that $3 trillion is about $300 billion to $400 billion of direct medical spend, just for the management of obesity, we spend more in the U.S. every year than the totality of all prescription drug spending, which is around $350 billion. There is no way to talk about an environment where the cost effective part, the solutions, the free market pricing we want to maintain could be maintained if we don't have new models for how to price medicines. So you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about duration versus the acute intervention on one hand to say I don't want that, because it might change the profile of my company; and at the same time say politicians should stay out of free market enterprise and the risk of developing a pharmaceutical, which is right about $2 billion; the launch price is the capture at least till a period of time all the investment that was made in developing the drug to that point; beyond that, pricing action have had different rationale based on the company, that's up to the company to defend enough for me or pharma to defend, but you can’t have it both ways. You’re either for value outcome or you're not. And we believe, I believe, that the future of healthcare and the cost effect is the only part that goes down in cost overtime, the pharmaceutical business compared to all other costs that we have to engage in value discussions about what our medicines do. I would much rather have a free market environment for the rest of the industry's life than to say well this might change in acute versus a maintenance environment, because the value that we get by being innovators and taking the risk is much greater in a free market environment, but that has considerations for different settings, it doesn't happened today. So we’re for that because the economics of this, mean that for us to contribute to solutions, we need the different way to think about pricing. I hope that's clear. Ronny Gal So I have got a series of questions about individual molecules we probably should hit. But in the meantime, let me remind folks who want to ask the card forward with question to do that now. So question about ABRAXANE, so we think that it's happened that you’ve gone that appears to be in that patent challenge I think against [indiscernible] again is October 27, 2024. Is this roughly we should think about ABRAXANE franchise facing generic entry, and just understand do we have a lifecycle management for that molecule beyond 2024? Mark Alles Thanks a lot for the question. It's really important because when you think about the molecule, this idea of using albumin as a preferred transporter of medicine is something that's Celgene hasn't spent a lot of been talking about. So Ronny thanks for the chance to mention it. It turns out that albumin is this ratio of paclitaxel, which are nanoparticles in the albumin suspension that we are working on a number of strategies where it turns out that platform is much more flexible than we might have thought. If you just think about how it comes out of the manufacturing process and the final steps and what can survive the embedded or suspended in an albumin nanoparticle. And we've done a lot of work that now gives us pretty big excitement about manufacturing that has a lot of flexibility about what we can insert and then create as a new molecule, so more to come on that. We're been a little bit of cautious because we're filing a lot of IP around it. But it turns out that tumors, solid tumors in particular, do through a mechanism called macropinocytosis actually don't do want to absorb more albumin than non-cancer tissues. So we're going to take advantage of that. And in a broader sense, we might have a sweet of opportunities off of that technology platform that actually make ABRAXANE a prototypical drug versus the only drug. And that could happen in the next decade. Ronny Gal So let's put it to -- so ABRAXANE 2024 is still… Mark Alles We still think about early 2020s as the cliff but we also think about it it's a difficult drug to make. This is not a classic generic. Let me give you example of VIDAZA, VIDAZA in the U.S. had lost exclusivity for two years before we had a generic threat. So we've already been down this road with tough manufacturing of injectable drugs. And it's not given that with expiry you have a lot of competition. Ronny Gal That's part of my thesis with Teva actually. But coming back to [multiple speakers] so the notions will be a second generation for paclitaxel specifically. I understand if you can potentially take this technology and broaden it, Mark Alles Probably not paclitaxel… Ronny Gal But other molecules… Mark Alles Yes, it would be other molecules and it's not hard to imagine what they could be. Remember, paclitaxel in its soluble form needs cremafor to be diluted. So you take almost any other cancer drug that is more soluble, it's pretty easy to imagine if we could perfect the manufacturing we can suspend it, distribute it and then deliver it through the albumin transporter. Ronny Gal Makes lot of sense… Unidentified Analyst So what was after that, durva… Mark Alles By the way, you're the first person that's asked anything about that so long, it’s like wow, a new question, thank you. Unidentified Analyst Durvalumab, PDL-1. When are we going to see the kind of in your mind the first proof-of-concept of that drug in combination with either CELMoDs or in general in combination… Mark Alles Yes, even REVLIMID. So we have high expectation that we'll have a number of ASH abstracts that would begin to show us some of the combinatorial response data and safety data. So end of the year at ASH, that's our current expectation. Ronny Gal You mentioned oral [cytarabine], so one of the opportunities here is really to expand the duration of treatment in not just patients who can no longer take epigen but across the portfolio -- across the disease category. If you kind of have to contract for us, what is it’s kind of possible that what is the contrast here between the patients who are EPO sensitive versus EPO no longer sensitive? And what is the opportunity in the patients that could otherwise take EPO for a new molecule? How do they compare based on quality of life. Mark Alles And so today, let me be sure that we're all on the same page, because there are a number of considerations about the patient profile. So first, in the context of whether we're talking about anemia that's transfusion dependent or independent, and that's coincidental to someone with MDS or leukemia. So these are contemporaneous issues. EPO is usually used before a patient or at the time a patient becomes transfusion dependent. So it's upstream. We're talking about downstream where patients have become transfusion dependent. At that point, if you can make them transfusion independent, the whole association with EPO is irrelevant, because they've been exposed to the ESAs before. And the casing point is the development of REVLIMID in low risk MDS. The approval for the deletion side Q subset was for patients who in fact almost exclusively had felt EPO, became transfusion dependent then they became transfusion independent on REVLIMID. We're using that same approach to whether it's low risk, intermediate risk, high risk MDS, or any setting in leukemia where unfortunately patients really don't become transfusion dependent, they need platelets, they need a lot of support. And so anemia is the least of their problems, because they're blowing through their blast count to unfortunately an early death. These are very sick patients. So anemia you support them, it's not about whether you use ESA or it's not about whether you intervene and shutdown the blast count, that's what we're focused on. Ronny Gal Anyone in the audience would like to ask the last question? And with that I guess, Mark, we really appreciate your time. Thanks very much. Mark Alles Thank you. Thanks everybody.

So I noticed that our first conversation going back to the Washington back, you seem to have a pretty clear idea of how you think the market will change, maybe not the final answer, the couple of steps from the long way. Can you give us a feel for what do you feel particularly strong about how things will change? Mark Alles So I feel very strongly that there is political knowledge and willpower to think about things like access and affordability not as a pricing issue by itself, where pharma companies are being singled out as the reason that access and affordability for especially those cancer medicines and other medicines that have a high development cost, a higher risk premium attached to them. I think there is a lot of knowledge that the end-to-end cost is something that the politicians the world around us, is beginning to understand, and wants to do things, for example, based contracting. That is indication specific outcome where we could take a molecule contract with payers and actually have for differentiated outcomes, differentiated reimbursements. So we think that's an important principle that's getting a lot of attention around the world. Those kinds of things are available, but they're not available yet in the U.S. And I think there is an awareness that they need to become more available. I think the payers are looking to do that as well. The PBMs insurers, they would love to engage in these relationships. But that's not available to us yet in the U.S. So I think that's one example. I think the other example that's very clear are these contracts that create an absolute problem in terms of access for patients where the co-pay can be 30% to 50% of the cost of a monthly prescription. Where for a medically necessary medicine, where it may be the only thing that will help a patient, they're paying more out of pocket for the monthly prescription than they would if they had a cardiac procedure that was inpatient in the hospital. And the distinction is that in the hospitalized setting, the patient is not exposed to the co-pay. But it's much more expensive and less cost effective in many sense than a medicine with the exposure that the patient is realizing is what everyone is focused on. We need to think about flat or some rational way to think about out of pocket expenses, co-pay coinsurance, whatever in the context of life saving medicine that keeps people out of the hospital, which are more cost effective than a surgical procedure or an in-patient procedure cost a lot more but no one sees the out of pocket expense. These are things that people are paying a lot of attention to and I think there's a lot of willpower politically to figure out better ways of sharing that burden and creating access and affordability across the spectrum. Ronny Gal I hear you. Let's say the first one for a second. So obviously the best example here is the anti-TNF market and the ability to price for volume across multiple disease area. But it eventually blocks you if you have a great molecule for one of the condition. There are two outcomes to what you say system that gets implemented first. You have a split down the middle in innovative industry what so called innovative industry, where companies work to establish franchises that run for very long time? I'm going to take opposite position to companies that have novel molecules. And the second one is that you have to have some government regulation of commercial agreement, which seems very difficult with a Republican administration. So help me understand how we get there. You're talking about system where you’re trying to do a system reform when half of your industry is going to object to this. And to some extent, there's no easy path to implement. So can you guys give me a couple of steps in the middle how we get there? Mark Alles I think what we're talking about at macro level is a regulatory reform picture. So what are we able to do from a regulatory point of view? That is instead of pricing a medicine by SKU or presentation of the product; you look at that medicine and in the context of looking at outcome for disease X versus disease Y; pricing would be improved or not, reimbursement would be improved or not; based on the therapeutic outcome compared to a number of considerations; a regulatory environment that would be encouraging that is something that I think is very doable. And it's hard to argue against the regulatory environment that supports better reimbursement for better outcomes. Ronny Gal So you almost, you almost stating that you would be -- you said you'll be in favor of an organization that will actually evaluate the benefits of the drug based on some sort of economical value. In general the drug industry pulls that like… Mark Alles No, in a simple way, in a simplistic way, that happens every day all the time. It’s just creating a regulatory framework where it's totally appropriate for multiple parties to decide what that outcome looks like in a free market environment. We're talking about the U.S. So creating that opportunity is really simply looking at regulation in a slightly different way. And I don't think there's opposition to that. I think that most people would say, for example, a generic drug that's pennies on the dollar, and by the way 80% of the prescriptions in the United States are for generic, 90% are for generic drugs, so system does that already. This would be in the context of, for example, looking at reimbursement at some level, private and/or governmental reimbursement, and having an ability to say a drug that does exit one disease using some framework for objective evaluation of that outcome that you could actually charge more or get reimbursed more for those outcomes versus if you have incremental benefit and for a tiny fraction, you might have some benefit or you don't get used at all. So this would also help research and development, because the fact is lifecycle management and looking at the cost of developing drugs, if you know that they're differentiated reimbursement schemes for differentiated outcomes that would direct a lot of R&D in a different way. Ronny Gal I can really see the benefit, the development of pomalidomide, it sounds like a very difficult idea to implement in practice unless you have an ability to like eye for saying this drug is evaluated for X in this indication and this drug is evaluated for Y in this indication? Mark Alles So you say eye serve, but it could be any framework. And that's what I mean by regulatory before. When we develop molecules and submit dockets through the confident regulatory authorities around the world, there is a framework for how a drug and safety is reviewed. So having a reimbursement framework in a private public market situation that allows for free market development of products, pricing that would be in a free market setting, but then based on cost effectiveness or outcomes differentiated reimbursement, that's something that’s very doable, very, very doable. You just need the regulatory framework for that to happen. I'm not saying it’s simple and I'm not saying we’re ready for it but I think value based contracting and value based pricing is a way to deal with the economics that we've been struggling with. Let's take the cancer market and everyone in the room can identify with the cancer market. The cost of cancer therapy is not the issue. It's the cost of failure. So let's take the current excitement about the immunotherapy class of drugs, PD-1, PDL-1. If we take the totality of the results of all the studies that have happened, and some have been remarkable, checkpoint inhibitors will replace chemotherapy, it's really incredible. But when you look at the totality, less than half of the patients who are getting checkpoint inhibitors today by data are achieving meaningful clinical durable benefit. I think people can argue, but wouldn't argue too much against that. But we're still treating 100 patients to find the 50 who might do really well. There was a great outcome at FDA last week where FDA with Merck approved a broad-based indication for Keytruda that was based on the biomarker as opposed to the tissue of origin for the cancer. I think that's a great outcome -- it's a way to think about future in terms of biomarkers across a disease category as opposed to tumor-by-tumor. So I think that was wonderful. But the cost of failure is what is so problematic. That's why we're excited about, for example, in our own portfolio, a drug from our partner Agios, we call it, Idifa, AG-221 was the old name -- IDH2 drug, and it's for a subset of acute myeloid leukemia, one of the most lethal cancers known to man. Patients with this mutation have recently been identified as subjects for therapeutic intervention and that's the drug now Idifa. It's going to be approved with the companion diagnostics. So you can imagine that the opportunity for us to price it in a value orientation where we partner with payers, we partner with diagnostic and we put it in a market where only those patients who truly can benefit should get it, and we commercialize it only that way. It takes the cost effectiveness equation turns it on a tad and makes it totally cost effective. Compared with for example, today, how IDH2 mutated AML patients are treated in a group of patients with either first or second line AML. And this goes on multiples of times in the cancer market across every disease category. The cost of failure is what we can afford. So figuring out a regulatory framework where more homogeneity, more contracting for outcome is endorsed and allowed, is something that there is a lot of willpower for it. I'm not saying again it's going to happen tomorrow, but that's a wave I think that's coming. And by the way around the world, there are lots of examples of it in other market. So I think it's just a question of when not if. Ronny Gal It's just a time regulatory approval to value assessment, and then I think it's going to similar to other countries around the world. Most drug companies will find really, really challenging. This is still a best market… Mark Alles I am not talking about the free market environment where the Company has the ability to price in a free market environment. What I'm saying is if you're able to engage whether it's Medicare or take or payer and engage in a negotiation about the value of the medicine and then reimbursement of whatever price you want to set that environment is coming in some way that's here today. Ronny Gal Well we can discuss this longer to different setting. But I hear you about the direction at which this market will go. Let's talk a little bit about where Celgene is going. So one of the things you started was this discussion of we will go through the REVLIMID and also exclusivity between 23 and 25. And you've got a great drug in REVLIMID, hugely successful, helps a lot of patients. But no company has ever grown through that size of a patent loss. Now you guys -- you actually have a decade to think about it. And it seems one element of the strategy is we're going to use our catalyst to buy anything that looks really promising in areas where we have competencies. It seems like the other elements of the strategy should be -- and we will also buyback a lot of shares, and we will keep our options open to do something with REVLIMID to separate it from the rest of the business, somewhere towards the end of the life, so you can see the value of the core business. Can you help us understand a little bit about the other element of the strategy, should we expect them? And if so when you're going to be able to discuss? Mark Alles So I came this afternoon to announce our entire M&A -- you're exactly right that we are in a window where REVLIMID represents a lot of the success for the Company; it's concentrated revenue; it has a tremendous margin; it throws off a lot of free cash flow; and we're using that opportunity to lifecycle and build the Company. In fact, it's how it would seem to be; it's how we did the Ozanimod deal with Receptos; it's how in part we were able to acquire ABRAXANE. And then when you look at our partnership network, a lot of our reach into the world of partnership comes from this wonderful hematology franchise that we’ve built. We have patent hill not a patent cliff. So when you think about our future, you’re right to say that we have a 10 year window before we're fully exposed to a generic market for [multiple speakers] because we structure the arrangement, the settlement, such that in the beginning of 2022 -- now Teva, is limited to a mid-single digit volume of generic lenalidomide. And that grows out to 2025 to no more than 30% of the volume of lenalidomide in the market. And in 2026, we have the full generic entrance. So we do have a lot of time. We, as I said at the beginning, have already built the pipeline of line of sight to 14 molecules with different approval dates between now and 2021. If I just look at the inflammatory bowel disease franchise and I look at the three products Otezla, Ozanimod, GED-301, in a mix of puts and takes on thinking about success there, all of those molecules with the potential to launch before or around 2020 that revenue alone that opportunity alone can offset all of not the annual REVLIMID sales, but whatever the peak is this is a replacement for. And remember the hill, means I don't have to replace it all at once. This is the difference between how most people think about patent cliff and how this is structured right now from a settlement point of view. We have a window to incrementally increase our outlook while we decrease what we see coming from REVLIMID. And mathematically and from a modeling point of view with our pipeline, our current portfolio share buybacks and continuing to deploy capital aggressively to build the Company through partnerships and other M&A, we do believe we would be one of the first companies that could grow through a dominant products patent expiry. Again, it's a patent hill not a cliff. Ronny Gal So let's talk about -- so all this is going to -- this is all going to be de-risked become evident as we go through. You think about the 12 month, I think you mentioned one key milestone, and that would be ABRAXANE in non-small cell lung cancer. What are the other like key de-risking events, key milestone events, between now and the end of the year just make it easy? Mark Alles So we just had a major de-risking event, and let me just take a second on Ozanimod. It is unfortunate that on the one hand we were clear about the results of the two Phase III trials on the other hand, it was important to point out what is actually the fourth ranked secondary endpoint in the Phase III clinical trials, which is the disability index. That had a lot of investor interest and we understand why. With Gileniya assumed to go generic in '19, it was important to be clear on did we versus Gileniya have a statistically positive outcome on that endpoint. But it was the fourth secondary endpoint that also represents clinically and in the market how important or not that is in terms of the product profile. So we have dataset that we're very excited about and want to present as soon as we can that will come later in the year. As I said and I'll repeat now, we see the SUNBEAM and RADIANCE data presenting us with optionality in multiple sclerosis that in our base case, we saw as a risky event. We're sitting here today believing we have the therapeutic value from a molecule that allows us to consider and we will very likely build another franchise around neurosciences. So this is an anchor molecule that presents for us the opportunity to become a player in a number of dimensions of neurosciences. That's how sure we are about the molecule today. When we presented it academically, I hope you'll invite me back and we can talk about the totality of the dataset as opposed to a press release and the top-line data from the two Monday's ago. That is an enormous de-risking event. The other part of de-risking is the Phase II proof of concept data for Crohn’s. We now have another molecule that we can move into advanced phase development for Crohn’s disease, which is an enormous unmet medical need with multi multi-billion dollar potential for an active state drug. And then of course, we already know about ulcerative colitis, the maintenance figure were quite positive that's where we got comfortable that the cardiac profile was different than Gileniya, albeit it in a different disease state. So we add this up and we've had a massive de-risking event on the biggest M&A transaction we've had in the history of the Company that sets us. When I think about the core business, where we are executing on the REVLIMID maintenance launch, I think about where Otezla is in its current performance. So that the core business that we have, we've been able to do better quarter-after-after for multiple years in a row in a way that gives us the strength to continue on the business development side as we have. So we don't necessarily talk about the core business as a de-risking event, but it absolutely is. We had a tremendous Q1, Q2 halfway through looks fantastic, the year looks good. That means that as we think about 2020 and beyond, we’re stronger than what we thought our profile was in our existing business, that's a massive de-risking approach. For ABRAXANE, we talked about the pancreatic trials. We don't know the data. We talked about the I/O, we don't know the data. So we'll see what happens as a de-risking. But throughout the balance of the year, we're also fully accruing clinical trials. So let me give you two examples from a portfolio; yesterday, we finished accruing a trial of CC-46. Remember, we have a drug called VIDAZA internationally, that's still patented that generates $600 million a year and it's the only drug that is an alternative for high risk MDS and a subset of AML. So in the U.S., it's generic now but in Europe, it's still generating $100 million in revenue. We have an oral form of this drug CC-46. We completed the accrual of a very important study, called AML-001. These are patients who get into remission, which is rare for AML patients. And the randomization is placebo as the control arm versus 46% as experimental arm, it's a maintenance strategy. So we think REVLIMID maintenance after transplant that's what we're trying to do in AML. So that trial is now fully accrued. It would be a very novel strategy and CC-46 has the potential not only to be a maintenance drug in AML, but a drug for AML. And importantly, we have information that's been published we're at prime as in epigenetic drug, as a precursor to checkpoint inhibitors. So there is some synergy and a primary effect that may play out to help checkpoint inhibitors to work better. And we're testing that theory in diseases like ovarian cancer for patients who get platinum therapy, do not progress with measurable disease, they progresses with what’s called CA-125. And that biomarker driven approach is where we put CC-46 before they get a checkpoint inhibitor. So we're testing this drug in a number of very important immunologic conditions. And there’s luspatercept this is a drug from our partnership with Acceleron. We finished accruing for a low risk NDS population. This study we are very excited about, because this is not only proof of concept in patients who are transfusion dependent but it's also way to think about luspatercept more broadly in any setting where anemia is problematic, and where EPO may or may not be a therapeutic choice. So it is an NDS treatment today, but we have no idea where this mechanism could take us in the future. So that's a study that's fully accrued that puts luspatercept in that 14 molecules with multi-billion potential, so that's just a standpoint of de-risking and excitement. Ronny Gal So one of the things that's interesting. So CC-46 you mentioned you accrued the AML trial. Remind us that nothing ever worked in AML in maintenance setting in a significant way, and this is comparing to the NDS trial the same molecule that's probably the more the riskier program? Mark Alles So Ronny, let me appreciate your point and make sure we amplify it. Maintenance strategies for blood cancers have largely been ineffective. There are two scenarios where it's worked really well, REVLIMID maintenance post transplant in myeloma and RITUXAN in follicular lymphoma. So two scenarios -- but other scenarios that the problem with AML and nothing has ever worked is patients are so sick that they rapidly progress to death. So even if you get an incomplete remission, it's such a short live remission that nothing has been effective to hold that remission before they break through and die. We know that from Idifa, we know that from VIDAZA. So this is a strategy that is a risky strategy but since VIDAZA works well in AML, we thought it made sense to take mechanism of the drug and oral form and test it in the setting. So it would be risky, but we think it's worth the risk. Ronny Gal So one of the things that I kind of learn is I was looking at the Company is the value of those maintenance programs. So this is the multi-year use of the drugs for years and years is what's driving the expansion of the REVLIMID franchise. So I hear about luspatercept, but one of the questions of luspatercept is. Should I think about this as a drug, which is priced roughly versus the people franchise or the RNS franchise, or something that's priced against other oncology assets in the high end of innovation? Mark Alles So, we're not looking at pricing outside of a cancer treatment market. So we don't know yet what the pricing would be, but right now it's an intervention for low risk transfusion dependent MDS patient. The point I'm making is that once you have that outcome, anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion. So I want to be careful that we're not thinking about this as some areas or EPO, but the mechanism and anemia broadly becomes an interesting discussion with a positive result in a low risk MDS market. Ronny Gal Make sense. The other question is kind of more broadly question for… Mark Alles Can I just -- one thing before we move on, I think the audience heard you talked about durability, maintenance and duration as a driver. I think this is very important point. So back to value back to outcomes where pricing maintenance therapy for different medicines the same as acute treatment today. You get my point? So medicine that's approved to maintain the benefit of other therapy, transplants this or that, the pricing today by regulatory structure has to be the same. Ronny Gal Good point. Why is that? Mark Alles Because that's the regulatory framework. We would absolutely be encouraged there’s an industry to look at alternative strategies for R&D about how to maintain the benefit or treat patients differently if the acute setting to control a disease, like cancer, was treated from a reimbursement perspective differently than maintaining the benefit of something else. So I wanted to use that example because we are in fact advantaged as a Company by the duration effect of the medicines that we have for cancer that control the disease extraordinarily long, and that's a big value driver for the Company. Ronny Gal So the question that comes here is that you're talking little bit about the double edged sword. So in one way, you're charging now somewhere between $130,000 and $160,000 for annual treatment with REVLIMID at the full dose on an ongoing basis. So the value here that you got a drug that worked for four-five-six if you had DARA seven-eight years potentially. And so the value per patient exceeds a million. Now if you allow the system to break away that compromise you just discussed, you might end up in a situation where those outer years, the value that you get per year of treatment, would drop dramatically versus getting the disease under control. Mark Alles So let's be clear what we're talking about. The economics of healthcare are not going to get better. Across the world and in the U.S., if you look at the discretionary spending economically, the proportion of discretionary spending that goes to healthcare is growing so rapidly, it's not drug pricing that's doing it. It's the totality of what we spend. Let's use some numbers, so that we're all together. The estimate this year is that healthcare spending in the U.S. direct is approaching $3.5 trillion. Some people think it might be as high as $4 trillion. Let's just pick $3.5 trillion, because off of last year, which was more $3 trillion, we're in the range. Obesity alone of that $3 trillion is about $300 billion to $400 billion of direct medical spend, just for the management of obesity, we spend more in the U.S. every year than the totality of all prescription drug spending, which is around $350 billion. There is no way to talk about an environment where the cost effective part, the solutions, the free market pricing we want to maintain could be maintained if we don't have new models for how to price medicines. So you can't have it both ways. You can't talk about duration versus the acute intervention on one hand to say I don't want that, because it might change the profile of my company; and at the same time say politicians should stay out of free market enterprise and the risk of developing a pharmaceutical, which is right about $2 billion; the launch price is the capture at least till a period of time all the investment that was made in developing the drug to that point; beyond that, pricing action have had different rationale based on the company, that's up to the company to defend enough for me or pharma to defend, but you can’t have it both ways. You’re either for value outcome or you're not. And we believe, I believe, that the future of healthcare and the cost effect is the only part that goes down in cost overtime, the pharmaceutical business compared to all other costs that we have to engage in value discussions about what our medicines do. I would much rather have a free market environment for the rest of the industry's life than to say well this might change in acute versus a maintenance environment, because the value that we get by being innovators and taking the risk is much greater in a free market environment, but that has considerations for different settings, it doesn't happened today. So we’re for that because the economics of this, mean that for us to contribute to solutions, we need the different way to think about pricing. I hope that's clear. Ronny Gal So I have got a series of questions about individual molecules we probably should hit. But in the meantime, let me remind folks who want to ask the card forward with question to do that now. So question about ABRAXANE, so we think that it's happened that you’ve gone that appears to be in that patent challenge I think against [indiscernible] again is October 27, 2024. Is this roughly we should think about ABRAXANE franchise facing generic entry, and just understand do we have a lifecycle management for that molecule beyond 2024? Mark Alles Thanks a lot for the question. It's really important because when you think about the molecule, this idea of using albumin as a preferred transporter of medicine is something that's Celgene hasn't spent a lot of been talking about. So Ronny thanks for the chance to mention it. It turns out that albumin is this ratio of paclitaxel, which are nanoparticles in the albumin suspension that we are working on a number of strategies where it turns out that platform is much more flexible than we might have thought. If you just think about how it comes out of the manufacturing process and the final steps and what can survive the embedded or suspended in an albumin nanoparticle. And we've done a lot of work that now gives us pretty big excitement about manufacturing that has a lot of flexibility about what we can insert and then create as a new molecule, so more to come on that. We're been a little bit of cautious because we're filing a lot of IP around it. But it turns out that tumors, solid tumors in particular, do through a mechanism called macropinocytosis actually don't do want to absorb more albumin than non-cancer tissues. So we're going to take advantage of that. And in a broader sense, we might have a sweet of opportunities off of that technology platform that actually make ABRAXANE a prototypical drug versus the only drug. And that could happen in the next decade. Ronny Gal So let's put it to -- so ABRAXANE 2024 is still… Mark Alles We still think about early 2020s as the cliff but we also think about it it's a difficult drug to make. This is not a classic generic. Let me give you example of VIDAZA, VIDAZA in the U.S. had lost exclusivity for two years before we had a generic threat. So we've already been down this road with tough manufacturing of injectable drugs. And it's not given that with expiry you have a lot of competition. Ronny Gal That's part of my thesis with Teva actually. But coming back to [multiple speakers] so the notions will be a second generation for paclitaxel specifically. I understand if you can potentially take this technology and broaden it, Mark Alles Probably not paclitaxel… Ronny Gal But other molecules… Mark Alles Yes, it would be other molecules and it's not hard to imagine what they could be. Remember, paclitaxel in its soluble form needs cremafor to be diluted. So you take almost any other cancer drug that is more soluble, it's pretty easy to imagine if we could perfect the manufacturing we can suspend it, distribute it and then deliver it through the albumin transporter. Ronny Gal Makes lot of sense… Unidentified Analyst So what was after that, durva… Mark Alles By the way, you're the first person that's asked anything about that so long, it’s like wow, a new question, thank you. Unidentified Analyst Durvalumab, PDL-1. When are we going to see the kind of in your mind the first proof-of-concept of that drug in combination with either CELMoDs or in general in combination… Mark Alles Yes, even REVLIMID. So we have high expectation that we'll have a number of ASH abstracts that would begin to show us some of the combinatorial response data and safety data. So end of the year at ASH, that's our current expectation. Ronny Gal You mentioned oral [cytarabine], so one of the opportunities here is really to expand the duration of treatment in not just patients who can no longer take epigen but across the portfolio -- across the disease category. If you kind of have to contract for us, what is it’s kind of possible that what is the contrast here between the patients who are EPO sensitive versus EPO no longer sensitive? And what is the opportunity in the patients that could otherwise take EPO for a new molecule? How do they compare based on quality of life. Mark Alles And so today, let me be sure that we're all on the same page, because there are a number of considerations about the patient profile. So first, in the context of whether we're talking about anemia that's transfusion dependent or independent, and that's coincidental to someone with MDS or leukemia. So these are contemporaneous issues. EPO is usually used before a patient or at the time a patient becomes transfusion dependent. So it's upstream. We're talking about downstream where patients have become transfusion dependent. At that point, if you can make them transfusion independent, the whole association with EPO is irrelevant, because they've been exposed to the ESAs before. And the casing point is the development of REVLIMID in low risk MDS. The approval for the deletion side Q subset was for patients who in fact almost exclusively had felt EPO, became transfusion dependent then they became transfusion independent on REVLIMID. We're using that same approach to whether it's low risk, intermediate risk, high risk MDS, or any setting in leukemia where unfortunately patients really don't become transfusion dependent, they need platelets, they need a lot of support. And so anemia is the least of their problems, because they're blowing through their blast count to unfortunately an early death. These are very sick patients. So anemia you support them, it's not about whether you use ESA or it's not about whether you intervene and shutdown the blast count, that's what we're focused on. Ronny Gal Anyone in the audience would like to ask the last question? And with that I guess, Mark, we really appreciate your time. Thanks very much. Mark Alles Thank you. Thanks everybody.

Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Tal Payne for a review of the financial results. Tal Payne Thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone joining us on the call today. I'm very pleased to begin the review of the fourth quarter and the full-year. Revenues for the quarter increased by 6% year-over-year to $487 million at the upper end of our guidance and our non-GAAP EPS grew 21% to $1.46 exceeding our guidance. Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results includes stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets, and acquisition-related expenses and the related tax effects. Keep in mind that as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items. Now let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Product in Software Blade revenues increased this quarter by 10% over the same quarter last year, reaching $288 million. We continue to see double-digit growth in our core appliances with strong transition to our new product family launched earlier this year. This quarter over 85% of our appliances business comes from the new family. The growth is coming from the small, mid, and enterprise-level security gateway. We see continued success in our Software Blade subscription with accelerated growth of 26% year-over-year. We see more customers choose the next generation threat prevention and threat extraction packages which include our advance threat protection solution. Our software updates and maintenance revenue reached $199 million representing 2% growth year-over-year. We continue to see higher discount rates versus last year but the trend has slowed down which is a good sign. Deferred revenues as of December 31, 2016, reached $1.066 billion a very strong growth of $160 million or 18% over December 31, 2015. You can see the strong growth both in the short-term and the total deferred revenues. The healthy growth came from both software subscription and the support business which had a great quarter. Revenue growth during the quarter came from across all regions. Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows: 47% of revenues came from the Americas, 38% of revenues came from Europe, the remaining 15% came from Asia Pacific, Japan, Middle East, and Africa region. From a deal side perspective, the number of customers with transactions over $1 million increased by 15% to 99 customers this quarter compared to 86 customers in the same period last year. Transactions greater than $50,000 were 76% of total order value compared to 72% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating margin for the quarter were strong 55% and aligned with our enhanced recruiting since last year. We can see the fruits of the investment in our results both in the core business as well as our focus area as in the advanced threat prevention and mobility. Effective tax rate this quarter was 11%. This quarter we had tax benefits relating to R&D tax credits, tax settlements, and lapse of statute of limitation on certain provisions in an aggregate amount of $21 million. GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was $222 million or $1.31 per diluted share, an increase of 21% from the fourth quarter of 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $247 million or $1.46 per diluted share. Excluding the tax benefit I described before results were great as well, our non-GAAP income for the quarter was $226 million or $1.33 per diluted share representing an increase of 11% year-over-year. Our cash balances reached $3.669 billion at the end of the quarter. Our cash from operations for the quarter was $183 million. Collections were very strong with DSO similar to last year. Income tax payments this quarter and for the year increased mainly as a result of the tax settlement for prior year as well as increase in advance tax payments for the current year. Net of the income tax payments our cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter increased by 4%. We continue to implement our share buyback program during the quarter we replaced approximately 3 million shares for a total cost of $248 million. Now let's take a look at the full-year of 2016. Revenues for the year were $1.7 billion, an increase of 7% from last year. Total revenues of products in Software Blades grew by 10% while our software updates and maintenance revenue grew by 3% year-over-year. Effective tax rate for the year was 18%. Next year we forecast our effective tax rate to reduce to around 17% annually, mainly as a result of expected tax rate reduction in Israel for high-tech companies. The reduction is subject to a reduction of tax regulation which is expected in March this year. We took this expected decrease into account in our guidance that Gil will provide later on. GAAP net income for the year was $725 million or $4.18 per diluted share, up from $686 million or $3.74 per diluted share in the same period a year ago. GAAP earnings per share grew by 12%. Non-GAAP net income for the year was $818 million or $4.72 per diluted share, up from $766 million or $4.70 per diluted share. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew by 13% and exceeded our guidance. Excluding the tax benefits, the non-GAAP net income for the year was strong at $797 million or $4.60 per diluted share representing an increase of 10% year-over-year. For the year, cash flow from operation reached $923 million compared to $917 million last year. Net of acquisition related payments accrued during 2015 and the income tax payment that I described before cash flow from operation in 2016 increased by 3%. During 2016 the company repurchased approximately 12 million shares at a total cost of $988 million. Now let's turn the call over to Gil for his comments on the year and the quarter. Gil Shwed Thank you, Tal, and good morning/good afternoon to all of you joining us on the call today. Q4 was a terrific finish to 2016. We've seen the investment we've made in our organization over the past couple of years bearing fruit. We've seen strength in business across all geographies The United States, The rest of the Americas, Europe, Asia and Middle East, and Africa. We've seen healthy growth in the number of new customers that have joined us this quarter. We enjoyed triple digit growth in our focus areas for the year, advanced threat prevention and mobility and now advanced threat prevention solutions have become a significant part of our business. Our security gateways which are the foundation of cyber security have produced double-digit growth for three quarters in a row now. Keep in mind with not all of the above trends are reflected directly in our revenues line. As many of the growth components mentioned above reside in the balance sheet where you will also find impressive double-digit growth in our deferred revenues. We have seen a nice business trend over the last two quarters. I believe we are beginning to see market share gains for increased new customer addition in competitive ways. Overall, it's a great way to begin 2017 after closing out 2016 with such a nice result. We just started off the year last week with our first sale kickoff conference for our America sales force and partners. The conference had record level of attendance with approximately with 1,700 attendees; the big four were strategies for 2017 was highly positive across the board. One of the key areas we discussed in the event was the future of cyber security and the realization that the future is already here. Predictions we've made over the past few years have all become real connected devices are integral part of our daily lives and are constantly under attack. It's hard to imagine our lives and business without mobile devices and in 2016; we clearly saw the mobile attacks aren't just starting from the future. They occur daily. Products like Hooligan that we first published in November reached over a million Google accounts and began with an Android malware and captured the main headlines of the Wall Street Journal in several geographies. Malware like DressCodes that we discovered in August demonstrated that mobile devices are used to penetrate corporate network and file service. During some period we have even seen mobile attacks approaching 20% of the overall volume of cyber attack globally. Expanded utilization of the cloud computing is also a trend which continues. Sometimes enterprise assume that the cloud is secured and don't realize that the cloud is just like traditional network, when you connect the new network or service to the cloud, you need to apply the right security measures just like you do with your own private environment. We continue to see malware becoming more and more sophisticated and just this summer we saw the National Security Agency toolkit are readily available to any hacker group on the planet. So clearly we see many of the trends that we have spoken about are already here. Yes pretty much everyone agrees that cyber security is becoming more and more critical, we can see that the very small percentage of customers are utilizing the latest technologies to block the advanced malware, protect mobile infrastructure and defend for Cloud deployments. According to our statistics between 1% to 5% of enterprises utilize these technologies. This is quite alarming, yet it highlights the growth potential ahead for our industry. Taking these medium trend into consideration, we will focus in 2017 on the future of cyber security cloud, mobile and threat prevention. We believe we have the best platform to secure every business environment in the highest level of threat prevention. Our industry leading solutions delivers an integrated architecture with a single console for security management and surprisingly the only solution that blocks malware on the first pass before it enters the network. For the industry refers to a first time prevent mode is quite unique to Check Point. With that in mind, we will keep working in 2017 to increase our market share by expanding our footprint by adding new customers and expanding our installed base. And now that brings me to our financial outlook. You know my regular caveat, there are restructure, there are changes and of course some upside opportunities that are not always reflected in what we can predict. But taking this into consideration for 2017 we expect revenues in the range of $1.850 billion to $1.900 billion. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $5.05 to $5.25. GAAP EPS for the year is expected to be approximately $0.70 less. For the first quarter, we expect revenues in the range of $420 million to $440 million and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.15 to $1.20. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.17 less. With that, I would like to thank you for participating in the call today and looking forward to hear your insightful questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Moskowitz Okay, thank you very much. Congratulations on a phenomenal Q4. Gil last quarter you talked about some sales momentum following investment in sales and marketing that you had made, previously and you have emphasized that even a bit more today in your press release but those investments actually date back to the beginning of 2015 and so I'm curious as to a) why you think it took this long before seeing the sales productivity those high as really kick in and then b) more importantly whether or not do you think that those productivity gains are sustainable? Gil Shwed Well the answer is first [indiscernible] for about a year until we got some of the benefits of the expanded sales force and we are actually even more aggressive now on implementing sales discipline, sales methods that will continue the trend. So again I hide to be -- to try and take this positive momentum and project too much into the future. Last quarter I said one quarter trend is not enough, now we are seeing two quarter trend and the trend in the fourth quarter was even stronger. So I'm little bit more optimistic about the expected highest productivity and expected results we can see from our sales force. Gregg Moskowitz Okay. Perfect. And you mentioned that all GOs were strong this quarter but Europe looked like it was extremely strong and curious if there were any territories that you would single out as being better than you would have expected? Gil Shwed I think this quarter again we are differentiating what I'm saying all regions were strong, I'm looking at internal sales trends that are not always showing already in the revenue recognition and Europe was strong this quarter, so no doubt about that but the other geographies were also quite strong in the fourth quarter. Gregg Moskowitz Perfect. And just one quick one for Tal, suppose if there was anything to pick at with respect to these numbers and it's hard to find much but it would be that cash flow from operations was down this quarter and only flattish for all of 2016, I would think that Q1 just based on the balance sheet, is shaping up to be a very good collections quarter for you but can you give us some sense of expectation for 2017 cash flow and how that might compare to 2016? Tal Payne Just to make sure that it's clear the cash flow was actually very good. I took out the increasing tax payments just so you'd be able to see the actual numbers, excluding the tax payments it's moved up 4% Q4 versus Q4 and 3% annually. Collections continue to be strong and so it's actually nothing new there. The tax payments specifically relate to advanced tax payment, the percentage sometimes change and then you pay one lump amount. This year we paid that higher advance payments but you will see less lump amounts relating to the current year. And we had the tax settlement that are related to which is included in the cash flow but excluding that it was in line and Q1 should be a strong quarter because it's collecting Q4 deferred revenues. So you are right, Q1 should be strong. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Walter Pritchard Hi thank you. Tal I'm wondering if you could help us understand what impact was product deferral in the fourth quarter, I think you have given expectation into end of the quarter, if you could update us on that and then if you could help us understand as we look at next year, you obviously give some of that back as it comes through the deferred revenue into revenue. But could you help us understand sort of the impact in 2017 of the dynamics you saw in 2016 with more product deferrals? Tal Payne So remember that the transition has started mid this year and we are at this point of time, I said about 85% slightly higher, so we still have transition in 2017. So there will be some effect of the next year as well. We included it in our guidance, so you can see net-net in our guidance we assume somewhere between 6% to 9% growth next year. So it's relating to the transition as well. Walter Pritchard And then on the fourth quarter, what was the impact in the fourth quarter, I think you just said it would be somewhere in the $14 million, $15 million range? Tal Payne So it actually was around, you're talking about the growth of the product. The growth was above -- around $13 million. I just want to remind that it's very hard to calculate that number, so it's a theoretical number because of the mix between the products and the VSOE but in general it probably was around $13 million. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. John DiFucci Thank you. My congrats to on the really strong quarter. Tal, every revenue line item was strong and including maintenance but as you mentioned you continue to see some higher discount rates. I just wanted to understand that a little bit better just to make sure we understand that's a ratable revenue line item. So we're seeing some effects from previous quarters as far as bookings. But how much of that in this quarter, how much discounting are you doing and why, is it primarily still because of foreign exchange where in Europe for instance dollar based goods are more expensive to someone in the local currencies or is it more to do with competitive issues. Tal Payne I think it's the same reason we talked before. I mentioned that the rates of the increase is actually slowed down which is a nice sign. But in generally you're right remember even in Q4 the dollar continues to get strong against the main currencies, for example, the Euro and there is a link between that in the increase in the discount also against the pound, so many of the main currencies the dollars still got stronger against them. So it puts more pressure and the pressure might be reflecting as well as at the discount rate. It can be some competition in general, it can be our focus on products which are doing very, very well and it's pretty much the same reasons that we've seen the in the last two quarters. John DiFucci And so I would expect we'll continue to see that as rates fluctuate in either direction? Tal Payne Yes, I think, I remind you that I explained that it takes like four quarters to see the full effect in the P&L. So the fact that it's stabilizing the P&L is very nice phenomenal. John DiFucci Great. Okay and if I could Gil a follow-up, Gil you mentioned cloud and how your team is focused on that and customers have to really look at it as just another network. Can you talk to us a little bit about how customers are looking at it today those that are moving to the cloud and how they are thinking about using Check Point products. Are you primarily being used in for north-south traffic or are customers when they move work to the cloud are they also using your products for east-west traffic which I know is it's used less often even on the data center but what are they -- are they just, are the cloud products for east-west traffic sort to good enough and they're more focused on using, what they're used to your products for north-south? Gil Shwed Okay. So first it depends to what cloud you're referring to. There is the private cloud which is in the company premises, here the network is segmented in a virtual way not -- not in a physical way and that's more the east-west traffic. We have products for that with this family knows how to work in this environment with VMware, with NSX, with Cisco ACI, and again we bring the sales umbrellas security management, security capabilities, threat prevention into the private cloud environment. The cloud environment today is doing quite well and is growing but that's still the list of the problem the company has. The bigger problem that company have or the bigger risk is with public cloud. When we put there workloads on the Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS and wherever the issues even worth because the product, because their servers, the network I'm not behind the coated firewalls so it's not just the issue of segmentation of the internal network but basically we're putting a naked server on the public internet with a very basic if it all sometimes no security capabilities that's all and that does remind me what happened 20 some years ago, when people were connecting to the Internet without security and then they starting to get surprised with they're infected and that they're tax come through. And now the cloud environment is not exactly like the physical environment but there is a lot of similarities. And the main notion that I want to covey and we are trying to explain to customers that Microsoft or Amazon gives us a great service on the cloud but that service doesn't include the segmenting your network or protecting you from advanced threat and where is the security with every customer needs to take care of, just like when we are buying a server from a HP or Dell or any other then though we don't assume that's we're getting the security fully built in and that's a great opportunity for us because we are the only vendor that has this full platform with where the customer can use the same security policies, the same security management tools and the same high level of security that were having the inside the enterprise for the traditional network, for the data center or the private cloud and for the public cloud outside the company its premises. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Shaul Eyal Thank you. Hi, good afternoon and also congratulations on my end and Tal, I think that last quarter you've indicated that the refreshed appliance is accounted for over 70% of the new products as if I'm not mistaken I might have missed this number if you've mentioned it earlier but how did it -- how did it do this quarter and how did the high-end appliances that's all in all perform this quarter and I have a follow-up. Tal Payne So, related to this that this quarter it was over 85% so, it's continued. And regarding the mix so, depends which quarter, this quarter there was a large increase both in small, in mid and in enterprise size so it's every quarter it's something else that drives us. Shaul Eyal Fair enough. And I think on the SandBlast did the strong performance we have been in the recent quarters persisted and can you talk to us also about the better performing Blade this quarter and was usually you do provide some color about probably there is top four five performing Blades. Gil Shwed So, yes SandBlast has a great quarter and they generally speaking the growth rate of all our advanced security capabilities has come up with the quarter so, that's a very good sign that we're keeping the growth rate and actually even increasing it, at a pretty high pace right now. We are now I don't know it was too much to talk about individual Blade because most of our sales today are in packages and the packages -- clearly the package for example for what -- for SandBlast which is the highest end package is increasing share. The next generation threat prevention is also increasing share and then next generation firewall which is now the basic package is in all the other installation but it's now pretty much the standard on all new installation. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Karl Keirstead Thank you. It seems that in your explanation of the pretty solid results here you're focusing on the transition to Check Points new appliances as well as the increase in sales capacity that you made that's now bearing fruit so those are relatively Check Points specific issues and maybe I just wanted ask Gil, Gil do you also think that the strong 4Q might have stemmed from overall security budgets feeling better the kind of broader uptick that might lift some of your peers as well. Thank you. Gil Shwed I definitely hope so. I mean, I think, again, we hear all over the security is a high priority. Again, as I said, I think that customers need a little bit of the market, not the customers need a little more education about what it means because we see the more sophisticated security technologies are used today by very small fraction of customers. I definitely hope that we are seeing some of these trends coming to fruition and that will impact as may be impact other companies in our marketplace. Karl Keirstead Okay, thanks for that and then maybe one follow-up for Tal. Tal as you put together your 2017 guidance especially on the earnings side I'm just curious what assumptions you are making around continued sales capacity build-outs obviously the sales adds you made in 2015 started bearing fruit in 2016 so, it's clearly a driver. So I'm wondering whether Check Point plans to accelerate again the sales capacity or will it be sort of more normal as you had in the last several quarters. Thank you. Tal Payne I think for now the plan is to make it in line. The fact that you see next year is the fact of the accelerated growth that we had this year. So I think if you look at our guidance you will see that I said tax rates we reduce next year to 17%, operating margin probably move slightly down and that will bring you to the guidance of the EPS. Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Michael Turits Hey guys coming back to the maintenance issue, the maintenance was up sequentially you had actually thought that would be down sequentially even for a couple of quarters getting discounting. So just to come back I want to just clarify that at this point is that your expectation is that the maintenance does continue to grow sequentially and is that primarily reflective of that greater discipline and lower discounting. Tal Payne I think in general the fact that the discount increased year-over-year naturally translating to the deceleration in the growth rate. The thing that it's hard to predict is how much but this quarter was very strong also an update maintenance and I said there was a slowdown in the discount which enabled it to stay actually in the same rate which I hopefully take. Michael Turits Right. So again just in from the on the sequential basis the quarter-to-quarter basis that have been somewhat of a concern that you have sequential declines as your expectation at least in this point now you're sustainably on maintenance growing quarter-to-quarter? Tal Payne We give the guidance for the total revenues and not line by line. So we take a few scenarios into accounting our guidelines. Michael Turits Okay. And if I have one more follow-up here. You're getting the greater attach on certain on some of your Blades sounds like on most of them, how is that related to ASPs and the size of the appliances that you're selling both on the capacity sizing on a dollar basis but is that greater demand for Blades driving demand and sales of larger boxes. Tal Payne We actually see a very strong increase in the unbundled Blade as well. So the fact that when we sell an appliance you have the bundle, and as we all know this year the bundle is larger than the on the old appliances. But even if we eliminate that one and we look at the growth in the unbundled Blade when customers are just purchasing the packages of the Blades detach from the appliance we see a very, very strong increase of customers adding and moving up in the package level from next generation firewall to next generation threat extraction and threat prevention. So there is a higher ASP per package as we move up. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gabriela Borges Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. May be just a little bit more qualitative commentary if you could on the double-digit growth that you're seeing in the core appliance business line may be you could just help us directionally on how that's trended over the last year or so. And may be as well historically how it compares to what you might have seen in the 2014 and 2015 or 2016 timeframe? Thank you. Tal Payne So we don't provide this quarterly but I think when we want, we discuss it specifically this year, typically we give the total product booking. We don't relate to the growth of the units and separately just because it can be a mix shift that can change it. The reason we talked about this year is exactly because there was a year that we launched a new product line and when you look at when we launched it like four years ago in 2011, we experienced a significant increase in number of units but the ASP reduced significantly. So the total result was a net zero some gain basically. At this time, we launched it in I think in a smarter way -- we launched it with a price level that fitted the increase as well in the capacities of the appliances and the result we succeeded to enjoy both an increase in the number of units and increase in the dollar value. So it was a quite successful transition for customers and for us. Gabriela Borges That's very helpful and thank you. And as a follow-up if I could may be on the opportunity that you see had in the advanced fraud protection space, could you may be just describe a little bit on how customers are allocating budgets towards advanced fraud protection for 2017 and whether you still primarily see it as a Greenfield opportunity or whether that's a little bit of displacement as well. Thank you. Gil Shwed First we have some nice displacements of vendors that have been in this industry for a few years but mostly it's a Greenfield opportunity. As I mentioned today about 4% of customers actually use advanced threat prevention capabilities, a little bit more by the way buy, I mean for our customers that are buying it and are not using it yet. And that's from my perspective, it's still a Greenfield and again even these percentages that are in the single-digit are not necessarily coverage of the entire enterprise. This is customers that have purchased these kind of technology still doesn't mean that they are using it everywhere on the network on a network gateway that they have. So the opportunity there is quite large and I think that for the first time, we are seeing that this is getting to a critical mass. This is already a volume that's a nice business volume for us; we see hundreds and sometimes even over a thousand customers which we are riding every quarter. I think the approach that we have first time for event that's fully integrated into security infrastructure is relatively unique in the marketplace and I definitely hoping that's the trend that we are seeing that more and more customers will use it. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Sterling Auty Yes, thanks, hi guys. I'm wondering looking at the trends in gross margins through 2016, I'm wondering how much of that trend was because of the move into the new appliance platform, is there the potential to see gross margins actually start to improve in 2017 as you may be get a little bit of volume and scale on the new generation of appliances? Tal Payne Actually the gross margins remain pretty much the same if you are looking at the product, you can see somewhere between like 82% and the same with subscription, same with Software Blades, the mix between products in Software Blade and support is the one that can create some change in mix. But even if you look at this quarter, you see 88.2% gross margins for the total versus 88.3%. So pretty much the same and I think hopefully it is pretty consistent. Gil Shwed I'll be -- I'll just be very blunt. I think my focus is not on improving a few basis points on the gross margin. The focus should be on delivering the best value to the customers and winning new customers and new gateway. So I think we are pretty efficient on managing the margins but that's not the focus, the success for Check Point will come, I mean it's let us put it this way. There aren't too many points we can squeeze out of our P&L right now. What we can do is actually grow more and that should be our focus and that's what we are driving the sales force to do is growing the deals we're working on especially approaching new customers and I think in the last quarter, I mean I think you've heard from me on this call, I'm very, very positive about the way we started executing on that. Sterling Auty Okay, I think that's very fair. One follow-up may be to a earlier question if I look at the benefits at the lower tax rate drops to the bottom-line it doesn't look -- it doesn't feel like all of it is actually showing up in the EPS guide which would seem to suggest may be some investment in the OpEx lines to may be support growth as you said. Where should we think about that growth coming in terms of sales and marketing versus R&D and maybe by geography? Tal Payne So, you are right that's what I was relating before you're absolutely right. I think the reduction in the tax enabled also to continue to invest, I said that the growth should be pretty much in line for next year. The reason you see a some operating margin reduction as a result of the investment of 2016 that is fully translated on in 2017. I think the growth is expected across the board but mainly in sales and marketing and in R&D. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Nowinski All right thanks. You talked about increase in new customer wins, can you give us any color on which vendors you put most frequently in those new customer wins. Gil Shwed I mean the usual first six are our competitors but they don't want to get into this, the main dropping and [indiscernible] of one another. We -- you know the players in our industry and I think we've competitive wins against all of them. Andrew Nowinski All right, fair enough. And then your CapEx has remained relatively consistent each quarter I guess you expecting large project in 2017 that could drive up CapEx from the current level? Tal Payne Actually if you recall the only thing is the building that we're investing and suppose to finish in 2017 right so, last year you saw an increase in the CapEx most of it is related -- most of the increase relating to the building and for next year it's probably going to be -- the building is remaining above probably $25 million which is completely in line with our original forecast that's the last year. So in total I'll say you should expect the increase in the CapEx is relating to the building. Andrew Nowinski Okay, just one last question I guess. You had the highest selling growth you've had in five years here I guess would you characterize that as an inflexion point you're doing [indiscernible] or were there just some large deals in the quarter that may boost that growth rate. Thanks. Gil Shwed We're definitely hoping that's an inflexion point. Again I'm always cautious about trying to project from the past to the future. The trends that I'm seeing are definitely positive. Tal Payne I would just say that even when you look at the short-term, I would say that long-term can fluctuate right. But if you look at the short-term you can see what's very strong. So short-term typically is not relating to one large deal it's more the run rate so it's a good sign on that line as well. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Tal Liani Hi guys. Two quick questions, number one is just sounds last every quarter, last quarter you said roughly $20 million in billings and it grew triple digit how was the adoption this quarter and if you can give us a little bit more color. Second question is more of kind of outlook for 2017 on the sending your plan, last year you invested heavily in sales and marketing and go to market and you also had new product, what are the focus areas for 2017 are there any special verticals you're going out there, you are increasing kind of focus on or products or anything else. Thanks. Gil Shwed So first of all Tal, we've seen tremendous success in Q4, the billing was much higher triple digit growth I mean everything continued in the same trend or slightly even better. For 2017 we are -- the focus area technologically are cloud mobile and threat prevention and advance threat prevention and that's a big focus for us. The cloud by the way is something that's new. Last year, we focused right, and we have cloud solution, we built infrastructure for that, we build and filled enablement activities but next year we are putting a much more emphasis on the cloud and we are adding into the mobile and threat prevention that's where the focus and success of last year. In terms of vertical we're actually seeing success in many different verticals including local government, healthcare. We're actually seeing a lot of these opportunities from these verticals finance of course remain our largest vertical and it continues to be that way. Tal Liani And Gil when you say Cloud do you mean more selling through Cloud carriers, Cloud providers or more selling to enterprises helping them more with their hybrid cloud environment? Gil Shwed It's mainly selling to enterprises, a lot of these sales and marketing activities are done in conjunction with the Cloud providers. We have nice cooperation with the large cloud providers. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Fatima Boolani Good morning. Specific one for Brent. Thank you so much for taking the questions. May be a first one for Gil, Gil in your prepared remarks, you did make a specific mention around the nice increase that you did see in new customer wins. I'm wondering if you can talk about any pattern or behaviors that kind of stood out from your new customer acquisitions in the way they buy or make purchasing decisions or what they are buying and then a follow-up for Tal if I may. Gil Shwed I don't have any insights, too much insight on that, I think we've seen the regular patterns I think some of it relates to the better perception of the Check Point has in the marketplace and the increased brand awareness that we have and some of it is related clearly to our focus is sending people to speak to new customers, what we do best we see tremendous results actually by the way did some brand awareness campaign and brand awareness surveys and we have seen with our brand awareness has went up quite nicely and actually our brand values and it's actually quite strong especially with non-Check Point customers or even with non-Check Point customers. Fatima Boolani That's helpful and a question for Tal, just with respect to the operating income and operating margin line, can you help us quantify the impact from currency devaluation with the Pound being down as much it wasn't just trying to understand how much that would have contributed to your operating margin results? Tal Payne Well you remember the dollar price listed in dollars. So when you look at expenses, it was pretty minor. Year-over-year all the currencies the changes in dollar didn't make a big change, very minor that we had from the beginning of the year. When we look at the revenues, it's hard to calculate because while we price in dollars, we saw significant increase in the discounts and that's why I was relating to it. So UK is one of the big countries for us and if the customers lost the pound value or Europe in general as you see from our numbers it's over 40% of our business so as the Euro is getting to par value with the dollar, that's a big effect on our customers. So this result actually shine when you take into account the fact that the currency lost quite a lot of percentage even just in Q4. So but we don't calculate it because I mean I can calculate it for you, you're probably going to come to an effect of more than $100 million in general that's why I don't provide it because it's an over number we are trying to deal with FX and not to make it reasonable. Gil Shwed The negative impact of $100 million. Tal Payne Of course, of course the negative impact yes. So it's actually we did great results even though the currency and the revenues is putting a lot of pressures on our customers. Fatima Boolani That makes sense. A quick one for Gil, if I can sneak one in. R80 has been GA now for a year, can you help us understand what proportion of the base has kind of moved up to R80 and to what extent you think that has helped with the quick adoption of the new product family and that's it from me. Thank you. Gil Shwed So R80 the security management portion has been in markets for about a year and I think the acceptance is nice and we are getting a lot of very good feedback. We filled R80 the gateway side which is and that's still not out and expected to be out soon. So that can drive even more adoption or really unveil all the sanctions that we have in diversion, so it comes not just to the management side but to the gateway side as well. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman Hi many thanks. I wanted to ask you about your outlook for the market and FY 2017 in a couple of different dimensions. Number one some of your competitors have talked about perhaps some excess capacity being out there from the buying patterns associated with calendar 2015, 2016. Just wanted to hear if you think at this juncture as we look at calendar year 2017 is there excess capacity and then b) if you could talk a little bit about your wins and how that's embedded in your outlook, why are you winning and what's causing those. And then the final part of that is discounting, you mentioned the pace has been abating, is I'm curious if that -- if your outlook is strong for 2017, why is there any outside of FX. In other words is the competition using in your view discounting to try to win deals or is it are they in fact responding to FX as well. So a lot of the three questions there as it relates to your calendar year outlook for the industry. Thanks. Gil Shwed I think it's very hypothetic. Clearly in our industry there is a lot of companies not just the big ones, it's thousands of site-ups that employ many people and there is a lot of selling capacity in the marketplace. As it relates to Check Point, I don't think that we have excess capacity, I wish we could have even more people and utilize them in the right way and again I think the key for us is not the number of people but the methodology and the process and how we work. Let's say I think once we get say all of it and once we get improvement on that, I won't be shying from adding even more people because I think that we have -- we have a tremendous opportunity still out there in the marketplace. Discounting, we are in a competitive market, discounting is used. I don't think that's the main issue but prevents anyone from achieving better results but clearly there is a competitive market and people are using also discounting as sales tactics. Keith Bachman Okay. If you could just talk a little bit about your wins and you mentioned you thought you gained incremental market share this quarter, if you could talk a little bit about wins, why are you winning those shares I assume is discounting helping those wins or what's the technology advantage that you think is driving those incremental opportunities for you. Many thanks. Gil Shwed Discounting is something necessary to win but it's definitely not the reason we are winning. The reason we are winning is clearly the technology is the first the fact that we can do security consolidation, it's the security management and again it's not just management because it is easier, the technical aspects of it, it's the operational efficiency that the company has seen that. With Check Point, you can get and you get external data from companies like NSS on average that would tell you that you would need 50% less staff to manage a Check Point security environment, when a competitor security environment and when you add to get the consolidation of multiple security features it is even better. The quality of product, the quality of security is also coming up quite strongly by customers. I think that's the main tool I mean from all our surveys and we check that and we do even quantity of surveys with customers on that. These are the operational efficiency and level of security are the two primary factors that's coming from customers to why to choose Check Point. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Philip Winslow Hi thanks and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. I just actually wanted to rewind the clock back to 2012 and you guys have talked about sort of on average maybe five year sort of refresh cycles for hardware and if I think back to 2012 that was when you guys talk about the trading down effect. But it's very strong year from a unit perspective. So as you think about 2017 and sort of potential refreshing that big uptick that you have in units, how are you kind of contemplating that in your guidance what affect do you, do you think you see from sort of potential refresh of that increasing units in 2012. Tal Payne Yes, I was so remember that the price in the budget the customer had back then. The units increased when we take the entire four quarters you see that it was a very strong double-digit in the beginning and then it started to move down and they actually moved up. So the full year actually ended up a normal year where we finished the year of the transition. I will tell part of the guidance that we provide that's why you have the range and there is two things that affects one is the number of units and second the ASP. The higher the unit, the lower the -- the higher the ASP uses the lower the quantity. So it's really hard to predict the mix of the units and it's whole part of the range of the guidance that we provided. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question. Shebly Seyrafi Yes, thank you very much so I just want to reconcile your security gateway business you say with that double-digit I assume year-to-year. With your quantitative license growth which was only 2% year-to-year can you just talk about the puts and takes in that product and licenses outlined. Tal Payne Sure, that's relating to the transition that we had between the old appliances and the new appliances. The new appliances include a bigger Software Blade package so while total ASP per unit increased significantly and that's what I was relating in double-digit, some of the dollar values been deferred and going to be deferred revenues and is recognized over four quarter and that's what Gil and me was relating to that you can see a lot of it going to the deferred revenue where you see the 18% growth. Shebly Seyrafi Okay and separately according to my geographic segmentation I'm getting that your with rounded estimates because you only provide rounded percentage of your revenues that your Americas segment grew 4% year-to-year Q4 versus 89% the prior two quarters. I'm just wondering looks like you did very well in Europe whether you are seeing a slowdown in the Americas. Tal Payne So no, the answer is definitely we're seeing revenues; revenues can be effective by a few accounts rules. The main things so you see some quarters can be higher and some quarters in lower, you actually see the APAC was very strong then Europe then the U.S. you are right in the revenues but what Gil related to which is the business Americas was actually very strong. Gil Shwed Very strong, yes. Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Meintzer for closing remarks. Kip Meintzer Thank you, everybody, for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you during the quarter out on the conference circuit and during visits we do and looking forward to having a good year with everybody. Thank you, and have a great day. Bye-bye. Operator Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Gregg Moskowitz with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question. Gregg Moskowitz Okay, thank you very much. Congratulations on a phenomenal Q4. Gil last quarter you talked about some sales momentum following investment in sales and marketing that you had made, previously and you have emphasized that even a bit more today in your press release but those investments actually date back to the beginning of 2015 and so I'm curious as to a) why you think it took this long before seeing the sales productivity those high as really kick in and then b) more importantly whether or not do you think that those productivity gains are sustainable? Gil Shwed Well the answer is first [indiscernible] for about a year until we got some of the benefits of the expanded sales force and we are actually even more aggressive now on implementing sales discipline, sales methods that will continue the trend. So again I hide to be -- to try and take this positive momentum and project too much into the future. Last quarter I said one quarter trend is not enough, now we are seeing two quarter trend and the trend in the fourth quarter was even stronger. So I'm little bit more optimistic about the expected highest productivity and expected results we can see from our sales force. Gregg Moskowitz Okay. Perfect. And you mentioned that all GOs were strong this quarter but Europe looked like it was extremely strong and curious if there were any territories that you would single out as being better than you would have expected? Gil Shwed I think this quarter again we are differentiating what I'm saying all regions were strong, I'm looking at internal sales trends that are not always showing already in the revenue recognition and Europe was strong this quarter, so no doubt about that but the other geographies were also quite strong in the fourth quarter. Gregg Moskowitz Perfect. And just one quick one for Tal, suppose if there was anything to pick at with respect to these numbers and it's hard to find much but it would be that cash flow from operations was down this quarter and only flattish for all of 2016, I would think that Q1 just based on the balance sheet, is shaping up to be a very good collections quarter for you but can you give us some sense of expectation for 2017 cash flow and how that might compare to 2016? Tal Payne Just to make sure that it's clear the cash flow was actually very good. I took out the increasing tax payments just so you'd be able to see the actual numbers, excluding the tax payments it's moved up 4% Q4 versus Q4 and 3% annually. Collections continue to be strong and so it's actually nothing new there. The tax payments specifically relate to advanced tax payment, the percentage sometimes change and then you pay one lump amount. This year we paid that higher advance payments but you will see less lump amounts relating to the current year. And we had the tax settlement that are related to which is included in the cash flow but excluding that it was in line and Q1 should be a strong quarter because it's collecting Q4 deferred revenues. So you are right, Q1 should be strong. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Walter Pritchard Hi thank you. Tal I'm wondering if you could help us understand what impact was product deferral in the fourth quarter, I think you have given expectation into end of the quarter, if you could update us on that and then if you could help us understand as we look at next year, you obviously give some of that back as it comes through the deferred revenue into revenue. But could you help us understand sort of the impact in 2017 of the dynamics you saw in 2016 with more product deferrals? Tal Payne So remember that the transition has started mid this year and we are at this point of time, I said about 85% slightly higher, so we still have transition in 2017. So there will be some effect of the next year as well. We included it in our guidance, so you can see net-net in our guidance we assume somewhere between 6% to 9% growth next year. So it's relating to the transition as well. Walter Pritchard And then on the fourth quarter, what was the impact in the fourth quarter, I think you just said it would be somewhere in the $14 million, $15 million range? Tal Payne So it actually was around, you're talking about the growth of the product. The growth was above -- around $13 million. I just want to remind that it's very hard to calculate that number, so it's a theoretical number because of the mix between the products and the VSOE but in general it probably was around $13 million. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. John DiFucci Thank you. My congrats to on the really strong quarter. Tal, every revenue line item was strong and including maintenance but as you mentioned you continue to see some higher discount rates. I just wanted to understand that a little bit better just to make sure we understand that's a ratable revenue line item. So we're seeing some effects from previous quarters as far as bookings. But how much of that in this quarter, how much discounting are you doing and why, is it primarily still because of foreign exchange where in Europe for instance dollar based goods are more expensive to someone in the local currencies or is it more to do with competitive issues. Tal Payne I think it's the same reason we talked before. I mentioned that the rates of the increase is actually slowed down which is a nice sign. But in generally you're right remember even in Q4 the dollar continues to get strong against the main currencies, for example, the Euro and there is a link between that in the increase in the discount also against the pound, so many of the main currencies the dollars still got stronger against them. So it puts more pressure and the pressure might be reflecting as well as at the discount rate. It can be some competition in general, it can be our focus on products which are doing very, very well and it's pretty much the same reasons that we've seen the in the last two quarters. John DiFucci And so I would expect we'll continue to see that as rates fluctuate in either direction? Tal Payne Yes, I think, I remind you that I explained that it takes like four quarters to see the full effect in the P&L. So the fact that it's stabilizing the P&L is very nice phenomenal. John DiFucci Great. Okay and if I could Gil a follow-up, Gil you mentioned cloud and how your team is focused on that and customers have to really look at it as just another network. Can you talk to us a little bit about how customers are looking at it today those that are moving to the cloud and how they are thinking about using Check Point products. Are you primarily being used in for north-south traffic or are customers when they move work to the cloud are they also using your products for east-west traffic which I know is it's used less often even on the data center but what are they -- are they just, are the cloud products for east-west traffic sort to good enough and they're more focused on using, what they're used to your products for north-south? Gil Shwed Okay. So first it depends to what cloud you're referring to. There is the private cloud which is in the company premises, here the network is segmented in a virtual way not -- not in a physical way and that's more the east-west traffic. We have products for that with this family knows how to work in this environment with VMware, with NSX, with Cisco ACI, and again we bring the sales umbrellas security management, security capabilities, threat prevention into the private cloud environment. The cloud environment today is doing quite well and is growing but that's still the list of the problem the company has. The bigger problem that company have or the bigger risk is with public cloud. When we put there workloads on the Microsoft Azure and Amazon AWS and wherever the issues even worth because the product, because their servers, the network I'm not behind the coated firewalls so it's not just the issue of segmentation of the internal network but basically we're putting a naked server on the public internet with a very basic if it all sometimes no security capabilities that's all and that does remind me what happened 20 some years ago, when people were connecting to the Internet without security and then they starting to get surprised with they're infected and that they're tax come through. And now the cloud environment is not exactly like the physical environment but there is a lot of similarities. And the main notion that I want to covey and we are trying to explain to customers that Microsoft or Amazon gives us a great service on the cloud but that service doesn't include the segmenting your network or protecting you from advanced threat and where is the security with every customer needs to take care of, just like when we are buying a server from a HP or Dell or any other then though we don't assume that's we're getting the security fully built in and that's a great opportunity for us because we are the only vendor that has this full platform with where the customer can use the same security policies, the same security management tools and the same high level of security that were having the inside the enterprise for the traditional network, for the data center or the private cloud and for the public cloud outside the company its premises. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shaul Eyal with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question. Shaul Eyal Thank you. Hi, good afternoon and also congratulations on my end and Tal, I think that last quarter you've indicated that the refreshed appliance is accounted for over 70% of the new products as if I'm not mistaken I might have missed this number if you've mentioned it earlier but how did it -- how did it do this quarter and how did the high-end appliances that's all in all perform this quarter and I have a follow-up. Tal Payne So, related to this that this quarter it was over 85% so, it's continued. And regarding the mix so, depends which quarter, this quarter there was a large increase both in small, in mid and in enterprise size so it's every quarter it's something else that drives us. Shaul Eyal Fair enough. And I think on the SandBlast did the strong performance we have been in the recent quarters persisted and can you talk to us also about the better performing Blade this quarter and was usually you do provide some color about probably there is top four five performing Blades. Gil Shwed So, yes SandBlast has a great quarter and they generally speaking the growth rate of all our advanced security capabilities has come up with the quarter so, that's a very good sign that we're keeping the growth rate and actually even increasing it, at a pretty high pace right now. We are now I don't know it was too much to talk about individual Blade because most of our sales today are in packages and the packages -- clearly the package for example for what -- for SandBlast which is the highest end package is increasing share. The next generation threat prevention is also increasing share and then next generation firewall which is now the basic package is in all the other installation but it's now pretty much the standard on all new installation. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Karl Keirstead Thank you. It seems that in your explanation of the pretty solid results here you're focusing on the transition to Check Points new appliances as well as the increase in sales capacity that you made that's now bearing fruit so those are relatively Check Points specific issues and maybe I just wanted ask Gil, Gil do you also think that the strong 4Q might have stemmed from overall security budgets feeling better the kind of broader uptick that might lift some of your peers as well. Thank you. Gil Shwed I definitely hope so. I mean, I think, again, we hear all over the security is a high priority. Again, as I said, I think that customers need a little bit of the market, not the customers need a little more education about what it means because we see the more sophisticated security technologies are used today by very small fraction of customers. I definitely hope that we are seeing some of these trends coming to fruition and that will impact as may be impact other companies in our marketplace. Karl Keirstead Okay, thanks for that and then maybe one follow-up for Tal. Tal as you put together your 2017 guidance especially on the earnings side I'm just curious what assumptions you are making around continued sales capacity build-outs obviously the sales adds you made in 2015 started bearing fruit in 2016 so, it's clearly a driver. So I'm wondering whether Check Point plans to accelerate again the sales capacity or will it be sort of more normal as you had in the last several quarters. Thank you. Tal Payne I think for now the plan is to make it in line. The fact that you see next year is the fact of the accelerated growth that we had this year. So I think if you look at our guidance you will see that I said tax rates we reduce next year to 17%, operating margin probably move slightly down and that will bring you to the guidance of the EPS. Operator  Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Michael Turits Hey guys coming back to the maintenance issue, the maintenance was up sequentially you had actually thought that would be down sequentially even for a couple of quarters getting discounting. So just to come back I want to just clarify that at this point is that your expectation is that the maintenance does continue to grow sequentially and is that primarily reflective of that greater discipline and lower discounting. Tal Payne I think in general the fact that the discount increased year-over-year naturally translating to the deceleration in the growth rate. The thing that it's hard to predict is how much but this quarter was very strong also an update maintenance and I said there was a slowdown in the discount which enabled it to stay actually in the same rate which I hopefully take. Michael Turits Right. So again just in from the on the sequential basis the quarter-to-quarter basis that have been somewhat of a concern that you have sequential declines as your expectation at least in this point now you're sustainably on maintenance growing quarter-to-quarter? Tal Payne We give the guidance for the total revenues and not line by line. So we take a few scenarios into accounting our guidelines. Michael Turits Okay. And if I have one more follow-up here. You're getting the greater attach on certain on some of your Blades sounds like on most of them, how is that related to ASPs and the size of the appliances that you're selling both on the capacity sizing on a dollar basis but is that greater demand for Blades driving demand and sales of larger boxes. Tal Payne We actually see a very strong increase in the unbundled Blade as well. So the fact that when we sell an appliance you have the bundle, and as we all know this year the bundle is larger than the on the old appliances. But even if we eliminate that one and we look at the growth in the unbundled Blade when customers are just purchasing the packages of the Blades detach from the appliance we see a very, very strong increase of customers adding and moving up in the package level from next generation firewall to next generation threat extraction and threat prevention. So there is a higher ASP per package as we move up. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Gabriela Borges Great, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. May be just a little bit more qualitative commentary if you could on the double-digit growth that you're seeing in the core appliance business line may be you could just help us directionally on how that's trended over the last year or so. And may be as well historically how it compares to what you might have seen in the 2014 and 2015 or 2016 timeframe? Thank you. Tal Payne So we don't provide this quarterly but I think when we want, we discuss it specifically this year, typically we give the total product booking. We don't relate to the growth of the units and separately just because it can be a mix shift that can change it. The reason we talked about this year is exactly because there was a year that we launched a new product line and when you look at when we launched it like four years ago in 2011, we experienced a significant increase in number of units but the ASP reduced significantly. So the total result was a net zero some gain basically. At this time, we launched it in I think in a smarter way -- we launched it with a price level that fitted the increase as well in the capacities of the appliances and the result we succeeded to enjoy both an increase in the number of units and increase in the dollar value. So it was a quite successful transition for customers and for us. Gabriela Borges That's very helpful and thank you. And as a follow-up if I could may be on the opportunity that you see had in the advanced fraud protection space, could you may be just describe a little bit on how customers are allocating budgets towards advanced fraud protection for 2017 and whether you still primarily see it as a Greenfield opportunity or whether that's a little bit of displacement as well. Thank you. Gil Shwed First we have some nice displacements of vendors that have been in this industry for a few years but mostly it's a Greenfield opportunity. As I mentioned today about 4% of customers actually use advanced threat prevention capabilities, a little bit more by the way buy, I mean for our customers that are buying it and are not using it yet. And that's from my perspective, it's still a Greenfield and again even these percentages that are in the single-digit are not necessarily coverage of the entire enterprise. This is customers that have purchased these kind of technology still doesn't mean that they are using it everywhere on the network on a network gateway that they have. So the opportunity there is quite large and I think that for the first time, we are seeing that this is getting to a critical mass. This is already a volume that's a nice business volume for us; we see hundreds and sometimes even over a thousand customers which we are riding every quarter. I think the approach that we have first time for event that's fully integrated into security infrastructure is relatively unique in the marketplace and I definitely hoping that's the trend that we are seeing that more and more customers will use it. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Sterling Auty Yes, thanks, hi guys. I'm wondering looking at the trends in gross margins through 2016, I'm wondering how much of that trend was because of the move into the new appliance platform, is there the potential to see gross margins actually start to improve in 2017 as you may be get a little bit of volume and scale on the new generation of appliances? Tal Payne Actually the gross margins remain pretty much the same if you are looking at the product, you can see somewhere between like 82% and the same with subscription, same with Software Blades, the mix between products in Software Blade and support is the one that can create some change in mix. But even if you look at this quarter, you see 88.2% gross margins for the total versus 88.3%. So pretty much the same and I think hopefully it is pretty consistent. Gil Shwed I'll be -- I'll just be very blunt. I think my focus is not on improving a few basis points on the gross margin. The focus should be on delivering the best value to the customers and winning new customers and new gateway. So I think we are pretty efficient on managing the margins but that's not the focus, the success for Check Point will come, I mean it's let us put it this way. There aren't too many points we can squeeze out of our P&L right now. What we can do is actually grow more and that should be our focus and that's what we are driving the sales force to do is growing the deals we're working on especially approaching new customers and I think in the last quarter, I mean I think you've heard from me on this call, I'm very, very positive about the way we started executing on that. Sterling Auty Okay, I think that's very fair. One follow-up may be to a earlier question if I look at the benefits at the lower tax rate drops to the bottom-line it doesn't look -- it doesn't feel like all of it is actually showing up in the EPS guide which would seem to suggest may be some investment in the OpEx lines to may be support growth as you said. Where should we think about that growth coming in terms of sales and marketing versus R&D and maybe by geography? Tal Payne So, you are right that's what I was relating before you're absolutely right. I think the reduction in the tax enabled also to continue to invest, I said that the growth should be pretty much in line for next year. The reason you see a some operating margin reduction as a result of the investment of 2016 that is fully translated on in 2017. I think the growth is expected across the board but mainly in sales and marketing and in R&D. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. Andrew Nowinski All right thanks. You talked about increase in new customer wins, can you give us any color on which vendors you put most frequently in those new customer wins. Gil Shwed I mean the usual first six are our competitors but they don't want to get into this, the main dropping and [indiscernible] of one another. We -- you know the players in our industry and I think we've competitive wins against all of them. Andrew Nowinski All right, fair enough. And then your CapEx has remained relatively consistent each quarter I guess you expecting large project in 2017 that could drive up CapEx from the current level? Tal Payne Actually if you recall the only thing is the building that we're investing and suppose to finish in 2017 right so, last year you saw an increase in the CapEx most of it is related -- most of the increase relating to the building and for next year it's probably going to be -- the building is remaining above probably $25 million which is completely in line with our original forecast that's the last year. So in total I'll say you should expect the increase in the CapEx is relating to the building. Andrew Nowinski Okay, just one last question I guess. You had the highest selling growth you've had in five years here I guess would you characterize that as an inflexion point you're doing [indiscernible] or were there just some large deals in the quarter that may boost that growth rate. Thanks. Gil Shwed We're definitely hoping that's an inflexion point. Again I'm always cautious about trying to project from the past to the future. The trends that I'm seeing are definitely positive. Tal Payne I would just say that even when you look at the short-term, I would say that long-term can fluctuate right. But if you look at the short-term you can see what's very strong. So short-term typically is not relating to one large deal it's more the run rate so it's a good sign on that line as well. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. Tal Liani Hi guys. Two quick questions, number one is just sounds last every quarter, last quarter you said roughly $20 million in billings and it grew triple digit how was the adoption this quarter and if you can give us a little bit more color. Second question is more of kind of outlook for 2017 on the sending your plan, last year you invested heavily in sales and marketing and go to market and you also had new product, what are the focus areas for 2017 are there any special verticals you're going out there, you are increasing kind of focus on or products or anything else. Thanks. Gil Shwed So first of all Tal, we've seen tremendous success in Q4, the billing was much higher triple digit growth I mean everything continued in the same trend or slightly even better. For 2017 we are -- the focus area technologically are cloud mobile and threat prevention and advance threat prevention and that's a big focus for us. The cloud by the way is something that's new. Last year, we focused right, and we have cloud solution, we built infrastructure for that, we build and filled enablement activities but next year we are putting a much more emphasis on the cloud and we are adding into the mobile and threat prevention that's where the focus and success of last year. In terms of vertical we're actually seeing success in many different verticals including local government, healthcare. We're actually seeing a lot of these opportunities from these verticals finance of course remain our largest vertical and it continues to be that way. Tal Liani And Gil when you say Cloud do you mean more selling through Cloud carriers, Cloud providers or more selling to enterprises helping them more with their hybrid cloud environment? Gil Shwed It's mainly selling to enterprises, a lot of these sales and marketing activities are done in conjunction with the Cloud providers. We have nice cooperation with the large cloud providers. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani with UBS. Please proceed with your questions. Fatima Boolani Good morning. Specific one for Brent. Thank you so much for taking the questions. May be a first one for Gil, Gil in your prepared remarks, you did make a specific mention around the nice increase that you did see in new customer wins. I'm wondering if you can talk about any pattern or behaviors that kind of stood out from your new customer acquisitions in the way they buy or make purchasing decisions or what they are buying and then a follow-up for Tal if I may. Gil Shwed I don't have any insights, too much insight on that, I think we've seen the regular patterns I think some of it relates to the better perception of the Check Point has in the marketplace and the increased brand awareness that we have and some of it is related clearly to our focus is sending people to speak to new customers, what we do best we see tremendous results actually by the way did some brand awareness campaign and brand awareness surveys and we have seen with our brand awareness has went up quite nicely and actually our brand values and it's actually quite strong especially with non-Check Point customers or even with non-Check Point customers. Fatima Boolani That's helpful and a question for Tal, just with respect to the operating income and operating margin line, can you help us quantify the impact from currency devaluation with the Pound being down as much it wasn't just trying to understand how much that would have contributed to your operating margin results? Tal Payne Well you remember the dollar price listed in dollars. So when you look at expenses, it was pretty minor. Year-over-year all the currencies the changes in dollar didn't make a big change, very minor that we had from the beginning of the year. When we look at the revenues, it's hard to calculate because while we price in dollars, we saw significant increase in the discounts and that's why I was relating to it. So UK is one of the big countries for us and if the customers lost the pound value or Europe in general as you see from our numbers it's over 40% of our business so as the Euro is getting to par value with the dollar, that's a big effect on our customers. So this result actually shine when you take into account the fact that the currency lost quite a lot of percentage even just in Q4. So but we don't calculate it because I mean I can calculate it for you, you're probably going to come to an effect of more than $100 million in general that's why I don't provide it because it's an over number we are trying to deal with FX and not to make it reasonable. Gil Shwed The negative impact of $100 million. Tal Payne Of course, of course the negative impact yes. So it's actually we did great results even though the currency and the revenues is putting a lot of pressures on our customers. Fatima Boolani That makes sense. A quick one for Gil, if I can sneak one in. R80 has been GA now for a year, can you help us understand what proportion of the base has kind of moved up to R80 and to what extent you think that has helped with the quick adoption of the new product family and that's it from me. Thank you. Gil Shwed So R80 the security management portion has been in markets for about a year and I think the acceptance is nice and we are getting a lot of very good feedback. We filled R80 the gateway side which is and that's still not out and expected to be out soon. So that can drive even more adoption or really unveil all the sanctions that we have in diversion, so it comes not just to the management side but to the gateway side as well. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman Hi many thanks. I wanted to ask you about your outlook for the market and FY 2017 in a couple of different dimensions. Number one some of your competitors have talked about perhaps some excess capacity being out there from the buying patterns associated with calendar 2015, 2016. Just wanted to hear if you think at this juncture as we look at calendar year 2017 is there excess capacity and then b) if you could talk a little bit about your wins and how that's embedded in your outlook, why are you winning and what's causing those. And then the final part of that is discounting, you mentioned the pace has been abating, is I'm curious if that -- if your outlook is strong for 2017, why is there any outside of FX. In other words is the competition using in your view discounting to try to win deals or is it are they in fact responding to FX as well. So a lot of the three questions there as it relates to your calendar year outlook for the industry. Thanks. Gil Shwed I think it's very hypothetic. Clearly in our industry there is a lot of companies not just the big ones, it's thousands of site-ups that employ many people and there is a lot of selling capacity in the marketplace. As it relates to Check Point, I don't think that we have excess capacity, I wish we could have even more people and utilize them in the right way and again I think the key for us is not the number of people but the methodology and the process and how we work. Let's say I think once we get say all of it and once we get improvement on that, I won't be shying from adding even more people because I think that we have -- we have a tremendous opportunity still out there in the marketplace. Discounting, we are in a competitive market, discounting is used. I don't think that's the main issue but prevents anyone from achieving better results but clearly there is a competitive market and people are using also discounting as sales tactics. Keith Bachman Okay. If you could just talk a little bit about your wins and you mentioned you thought you gained incremental market share this quarter, if you could talk a little bit about wins, why are you winning those shares I assume is discounting helping those wins or what's the technology advantage that you think is driving those incremental opportunities for you. Many thanks. Gil Shwed Discounting is something necessary to win but it's definitely not the reason we are winning. The reason we are winning is clearly the technology is the first the fact that we can do security consolidation, it's the security management and again it's not just management because it is easier, the technical aspects of it, it's the operational efficiency that the company has seen that. With Check Point, you can get and you get external data from companies like NSS on average that would tell you that you would need 50% less staff to manage a Check Point security environment, when a competitor security environment and when you add to get the consolidation of multiple security features it is even better. The quality of product, the quality of security is also coming up quite strongly by customers. I think that's the main tool I mean from all our surveys and we check that and we do even quantity of surveys with customers on that. These are the operational efficiency and level of security are the two primary factors that's coming from customers to why to choose Check Point. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. Philip Winslow Hi thanks and congrats on a great quarter and outlook. I just actually wanted to rewind the clock back to 2012 and you guys have talked about sort of on average maybe five year sort of refresh cycles for hardware and if I think back to 2012 that was when you guys talk about the trading down effect. But it's very strong year from a unit perspective. So as you think about 2017 and sort of potential refreshing that big uptick that you have in units, how are you kind of contemplating that in your guidance what affect do you, do you think you see from sort of potential refresh of that increasing units in 2012. Tal Payne Yes, I was so remember that the price in the budget the customer had back then. The units increased when we take the entire four quarters you see that it was a very strong double-digit in the beginning and then it started to move down and they actually moved up. So the full year actually ended up a normal year where we finished the year of the transition. I will tell part of the guidance that we provide that's why you have the range and there is two things that affects one is the number of units and second the ASP. The higher the unit, the lower the -- the higher the ASP uses the lower the quantity. So it's really hard to predict the mix of the units and it's whole part of the range of the guidance that we provided. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question. Shebly Seyrafi Yes, thank you very much so I just want to reconcile your security gateway business you say with that double-digit I assume year-to-year. With your quantitative license growth which was only 2% year-to-year can you just talk about the puts and takes in that product and licenses outlined. Tal Payne Sure, that's relating to the transition that we had between the old appliances and the new appliances. The new appliances include a bigger Software Blade package so while total ASP per unit increased significantly and that's what I was relating in double-digit, some of the dollar values been deferred and going to be deferred revenues and is recognized over four quarter and that's what Gil and me was relating to that you can see a lot of it going to the deferred revenue where you see the 18% growth. Shebly Seyrafi Okay and separately according to my geographic segmentation I'm getting that your with rounded estimates because you only provide rounded percentage of your revenues that your Americas segment grew 4% year-to-year Q4 versus 89% the prior two quarters. I'm just wondering looks like you did very well in Europe whether you are seeing a slowdown in the Americas. Tal Payne So no, the answer is definitely we're seeing revenues; revenues can be effective by a few accounts rules. The main things so you see some quarters can be higher and some quarters in lower, you actually see the APAC was very strong then Europe then the U.S. you are right in the revenues but what Gil related to which is the business Americas was actually very strong. Gil Shwed Very strong, yes. Operator Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Meintzer for closing remarks. Kip Meintzer Thank you, everybody, for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you during the quarter out on the conference circuit and during visits we do and looking forward to having a good year with everybody.
