Thank you, Cindy. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call as we provide an update on the change underway at Whole Foods Market. We also have some significant new initiatives that we expect will substantially enhance value for all of our shareholders. Our Board of Directors and leadership team have a long history of listening and responding to feedback from shareholders and believe today's actions, which include adding a fresh perspective and greater sense of urgency, clearly demonstrate our continued commitment to seek opportunities to enhance value for all of our shareholders. We also recognize the importance of providing greater visibility and transparency into the shareholders return we expect to achieve over the next one to three years as we further transform our business in this rapidly changing retail environment. As we enter the next phase of our evolution, we have significantly strengthened our team, including five outstanding new directors, and a terrific new Chief Financial Officer, Keith Manbeck. Gaby Sulzberger, our new Chair, is joining us today and will have more to add. We understand that we need to do much more, and faster. Our competitors are not standing still. We need to ensure our company remains a leader in this fast-growing sector. The initiatives and operational improvements we're undertaking will drive sales, EBITDA, and EPS growth, and shareholder value. Our business is strong with record revenue of $15.7 billion and over $1 billion in operating cash flow in 2016. I will give more color on the quarter a little bit later in my comments, but here are the highlights. Sales increased 1% to a record $3.7 billion, and we continued to see stability in our comps. While there is noise in the quarter due to the Easter shift, we saw some early signs of our sales initiatives gaining traction as evidenced in the 75 basis point sequential improvement in traffic trends from Q1. In a challenging sales environment, we maintained our expense discipline, delivered 8.5% adjusted EBITDA margin, $0.37 in adjusted earnings per share, and $340 million in operating cash flow. I want to reinforce just how committed we are to the initiatives we are announcing and to delivering the results. We understand that significant change is required at an accelerated pace. Through our proactive initiatives, we will continue to improve the business and create value for all of our stakeholders. Before I get into the details of our new plan, I just want to remind you that our investor presentation is available on our website. I'd like to spend a moment on page 2 of that presentation, looking at our business and values, what really makes Whole Foods Market the company that we are today. What sets us apart is our customer-centric approach and relentless commitment to our core values. No other grocery store matches the promise Whole Foods Market stakeholders have come to expect from us, the industry-leading food standards, the differentiated offerings, and the outstanding customer experience. Our customer base continues to grow, with 30 million different customers visiting Whole Foods stores last year. We have low turnover amongst our team members, something quite unusual in our industry. We're very proud that for the last 20 consecutive years to have been named one of Fortune's 100 Best Companies to Work For. This is a tough environment for everyone in retail and particularly challenging for those in the food industry, but we are the premier brand in the one area seeing growth, natural and organic foods. We delivered the highest sales per gross square foot and the highest EBITDA margins of any public grocer. Turning to page 3 of the presentation. The value proposition inherent in Whole Foods Market is very powerful. Our announcements today build on a strong foundation and on our strategic plan. Among our key accomplishments, we have reduced cost; fully implemented a unified point-of-sale system; piloted our affinity program; expanded our always-on marketing and media plan; accelerated the implementation of category management; grown our online presence and driven increased digital sales; launched our innovative value format, 365, to broaden our customer base; and prudently rationalized our store base. On page 4 of the presentation. As I said, while we have experienced challenges, we know there are opportunities for improvement throughout our organization. We have identified immediate actions to drive change and to ensure our company remains positioned for success. First, we have put forth clearly defined financial targets. We expect to return to positive comp and earnings growth by fiscal year-end 2018. By 2020, revenue is expected to grow to more than $18 billion. We expect to achieve comparable store sales growth of greater than 2%, SG&A as a percentage of sales of less than 27%, EBITDA margins of over 9.5%, and operating cash flow of more than $1.2 billion. We are accelerating the rollout of our affinity program to all U.S. stores by the end of this year. Through piloting more personalized and relevant communications, our pilot programs have successfully driven increased trips and bigger baskets from participants. We're very excited about the incremental sales potential from our core customers, adding just one additional item per trip. As we announced last quarter, we are in the process of restructuring our purchasing program and accelerating the implementation of category management. Through our initial pilots, we know that having the right assortment and pricing leads to lower cost, lower prices, and higher sales. We expect to complete the purchasing restructure by calendar year-end 2017 and the category management initiatives by fiscal year-end 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we announced a $300 million cost savings plan. Through Q2, we have already delivered $270 million and are on track to deliver the full amount ahead of schedule. More importantly, we are announcing today an additional $300 million of cost savings which we expect to achieve by fiscal year-end 2020 with approximately $100 million to be realized over the course of next year. Our financial strength allows us to significantly increase our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders. Today, we are announcing a 29% increase in the dividend and increasing our share repurchase authorization to $1.25 billion with the intention to opportunistically utilize this authorization over the next 18 months. These new capital returns are in addition to the over $3 billion already returned to shareholders since 2012. With all of this great work underway, we're building out our team to support these efforts. We're refreshing our board with five outstanding new directors which Gaby will highlight in a few minutes. This group brings investor perspective, demonstrated shareholder value creation, and long track records of success in retail transformation, operations, and finance. We're also welcoming Keith Manbeck, former Senior Vice President of Finance, Strategy and Business Transformation at Kohl's Corporation, as our new Chief Financial Officer. The Board of Directors will continue its comprehensive review of all opportunities to create shareholder value. Pages 5 through 7 of our presentation online provide further detail on how we will grow revenue from $15.7 billion to more than $18 billion. Our 2020 outlook reflects steady sales growth and an improved cost structure, which will deliver strong EBITDA and operating cash flow. Key sales drivers include refocusing on our core customers, disciplined organic growth along with our affinity, marketing, and category management initiatives. We will be disciplined when adding new stores, aggressive in our relocation strategy, and we'll look to leverage our Whole Foods Market 365 store concept, where appropriate. Across pages 8 and 9, on the online presentation you will see further details around our initiatives and our affinity program. Let's now move to page 10 of the presentation and our commitment to deliver an additional $300 million of cost savings. We're taking a number of steps to reach these incremental savings, including having hired a top-tier consulting firm to assist with the implementation of this program. In terms of the timeline, we expect approximately $100 million in savings in year one and $300 million in total by 2020, driving EBITDA margin expansion. Whole Foods Market has a strong track record of returning substantial capital to shareholders and as shown on page 10, since 2012, we've returned more than $3 billion to our investors. As already discussed today, we've announced that we are going even further. With that, I would now like to hand the call over to Gaby Sulzberger, the new Chair of the Whole Foods Market Board of Directors, to discuss the experienced leaders who have been added to the company's board. Gabrielle Sulzberger - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thank you, John, and good afternoon everyone. Whole Foods Market's evolution naturally extends to our Board of Directors. It is on us to ensure we have the right mix of skills and experience necessary to support the company's leadership team and our business strategy. Since I took the role of Chair of the Nominating & Governance Committee last December, we embarked on an aggressive search for the very best people to add to our board. We recognized that significant and urgent change was required, and we listened to shareholder perspectives regarding board and governance issues. On page 12 you will see why I am so excited about our five new directors. Today, we are very pleased to announce the appointment of Ken Hicks, Joe Mansueto, Sharon McCollam, Scott Powers, and Ron Shaich to the Whole Foods Market Board of Directors. These new directors are value creators and recognized leaders in their respective areas of expertise. They have transformed, led, sold and driven businesses and have created substantial shareholder value. First, Ken Hicks. Ken brings an impressive record of successful leadership at Foot Locker and other companies in the retail sector. As the former Chairman, President, and CEO of Foot Locker, he is credited with developing and executing a highly successful turnaround plan. Joe Mansueto is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Morningstar. Joe grew Morningstar from a start-up to a global organization that is one of the most recognized and trusted names in the investment industry. Sharon McCollam is the former CFO of Best Buy and Williams-Sonoma. Sharon has more than two decades of experience as a senior leader in the retail industry. Scott Powers brings an important long-term shareholder perspective to the board. Scott was the President and CEO of State Street Global Advisors and brings decades of experience engaging with the investing community. And finally, Ron Shaich. Ron is the Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Panera Bread Company. The results during Ron's tenure have been impressive, with Panera delivering total shareholder return of more than 5,000%. Turning to page 13. As part of our refreshment process, five existing directors will retire from our board. On behalf of the entire board, I want to thank the departing directors for their many contributions to Whole Foods Market over the years. It is truly a testament to their service as directors that they chose to step-down and make way for the new directors joining the board. Each and every one of the departing directors has our deepest gratitude and admiration. With these changes, the Whole Foods Market Board of Directors will be comprised of 12 directors, 10 of whom are independent and 6 of whom were added in the last seven months. The new board includes nine directors who are current or former CEOs or CFOs and four female directors. Also, in connection with today's announcement, I am assuming the responsibility of Chair of the board and we are announcing the appointment of Mary Ellen Coe from Google as our new Chair of the Nominating & Governance Committee. Mary Ellen joined the board at the end of last year and has been incredibly helpful with our refreshment process. Finally, we wanted to comment on some recent speculation in today's news. We first became aware of Jana's recent share acquisition when they made their 13D filing on April 10. Prior to that day, we had never been contacted by Jana. After an initial meeting, we asked to interview their candidates and they agreed. Under a confidentiality understanding, we discussed with Jana the substantial changes that the Whole Foods board was about to announce, including the outstanding new directors that our Nominating Committee had identified with the assistance of an independent search firm and who had all agreed to join our board. As part of those discussions, we identified two of Jana's nominees that we were prepared to add to the board in return for a customary standstill or cooperation agreement to enable the board to focus on the important tasks at hand. Jana indicated that they were pleasantly surprised by the changes, but they currently didn't want to tie their hands with an agreement. Both sides suggested that we would continue the dialogue. We are disappointed that our confidential discussions have been provided by Jana to the press. Nonetheless, what is most important is that Whole Foods Market has refreshed the board with absolutely outstanding independent directors who have track records as value creators and who are focused on delivering substantial value for Whole Foods Market shareholders. We look forward to constructive dialogue with all of our shareholders, including Jana. We will not be covering these matters further on this call. I want to reassure investors that the board is firmly on the side of shareholder value. Our directors, including our new members, are value creators, deal-makers, and experienced leaders. We will act with a focus on shareholder value. And with that, I will turn the call back over to John. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thank you, Gaby. Page 14 of our presentation shows why we are so excited to welcome Keith Manbeck as our new Chief Financial Officer. As I mentioned, Keith's time at Kohl's was marked by the significant role he played in the company's transformation initiatives, including e-commerce. Additionally, he has extensive operational experience in retail from his time at Nike, where he delivered more than $1.7 billion of revenue growth in the Direct to Consumer business in just three years. Most importantly, he is an independent thinker, believes in our core values and is eager to support our company culture. Keith's record retail growth is impressive and he's an absolutely incredible valuable addition to our team. Looking further at our financial results and updated outlook, while the operating environment remains challenging, we continue to produce healthy EBITDA margin and free cash flow. Our updated fiscal year outlook reflects additional costs of approximately $0.03 per share related to our accelerated rollout of affinity, as well as the engagement of a consulting firm related to our cost reduction efforts. Turning back to our accelerated path to delivering shareholder value and to page 18 of the presentation, we want to recap. We have a clear timetable to deliver strong results and the right initiatives to get there. On page 19 of the presentation, I want to leave our shareholders with an important promise from all of us at Whole Foods Market. We have covered a lot of ground today, so I just want to underscore that this board and leadership team is laser focused on doing all that we can to maximize value for all of our shareholders. We will continue to execute on our plan to evolve our company for the future while ensuring that we retain our business strengths and differentiated culture. As we make progress on these initiatives, we will provide transparency and regular updates. Our best-in-class board will provide valuable oversight and deliver accountability as we aggressively seek and incorporate feedback to ensure that we're always acting in the best interest of all of our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support. At this time, we'll turn the call over for questions to our leadership team. Thank you. Operator, we're ready to take questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to first ask about your margin guidance. You're looking for an increase in the EBITDA margin of 90 basis points over the next few years, decrease in SG&A of about 150. So just quick math, assuming all else equal, more of a modest gross margin investment, more like 60 basis points, than I think some of us were expecting. So first I'm curious, is that generally accurate? And if I'm missing something, please let me know. And second, if it is, I'm just curious why the investment doesn't have to be any larger? Maybe it's related to the comments in your press release about the upgraded purchasing program. Perhaps that's a little bit more of a driver than what I was realizing. Just any help there would be very much appreciated. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thanks. That's a good question. I think the thing it's not being shown there is we are expecting to gain significant savings in category management on the purchasing side. And we're going to – all of the money that we're going to save through category management, we're going to turn around and invest in lower prices. So there's actually going be a significant reduction in prices while maintaining similar gross margins. So I think that's the answer. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. I know others have, I'm sure, eager to get on. I'll pass it along. Thanks, John. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks again for all the details. Curious on what gives you confidence in getting back to positive comp growth later next fiscal year? And is there anything you can point to currently – it sounds like affinity has gotten off to a good start from what you guys have seen with your pilot test, but just trying to get a sense of what gives you guys confidence in getting back to positive comp growth. If you could maybe provide a little color there? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Actually that's a bottom-up. We did a lot of work on this. And we factored in the sales gains we believe we're going to get from affinity based on our test as well as the sales gains we're going to get from our initial category management tests that we've been doing. So we've seen strong sales lifts in the area – in the pilots for category management and in our pilots for affinity. So we basically have just extended that through the entire company. And those were the two major drivers. Plus, we think our marketing initiatives, particularly our advertising, is going to compound over time. So these – we actually think these are realistic and probably slightly conservative comp projections. But they're based on the internal calculations. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yeah, this is Jason. On the affinity side, we've taken sort of our proven results with the pilots as well as talking with our strategic partners in implementing this to make sure that the guidance we're providing there matches what's seen in other programs as we rolled it out. And we're just, quite honestly, really excited about the results we've seen across all three of our tests and are taking the very best of those parts of those programs and rolling it out companywide. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is David. The other thing I would add is our order-to-shelf initiative as we roll out that across all of our stores, each store as we go online with order-to-shelf, we see a significant reduction in out-of-stock. So again, customers can't buy it if it's not on the shelf. So we feel that's also going to help us with our comp growth. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Best of luck with your efforts. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open. Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Just to jump back to the three-year guidance. I may have missed it given all the information out there, but what's your expected unit growth for the next three years if you want to hit that $18 billion in sales? And if you have to potentially pull back on the planned unit growth or possibly close some stores, how does it affect your ability to reach that 27% SG&A as a percentage of sales number? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. I missed your last question, but this is Glenda. The answer to the number of units, we didn't give a specific number of units but we did say square footage growth. We do expect the square footage growth to be less than 5% for the years between now and then. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And. Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC Sorry. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And those stores growth is going to basically fall into three buckets. We're going to be relocating smaller stores to bigger, more flagship type locations because we've had such tremendous success with those stores like we've done recently in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York. Those stores do outperform and do extremely well. Secondly, we will be having more 365 stores. We just opened a store a couple of weeks ago in Austin, Texas, our 365 2.0 initiative. We're very encouraged with the initial results. Sales have been very strong there. And as we continue to test and refine our 365 model, can anticipate growth in there beginning to accelerate over time. In terms of closing more stores, I mean it's possible in the future we may close a few stores, but almost all the stores that we currently have operating have positive EBITDAR. So there'd be no cash gain from closing stores that are making cash for the company. And what was your secondary question? Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC Yeah, the second part of it was just if in fact do you have to augment that unit growth over the long term, does this affect your ability to reach that 27% SG&A as a percentage of sales number? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. If we grow faster, we'll reach it quicker because we'll have more sales leverage. And that will take our expense, like G&A, and some of the other fixed expenses, depreciation and whatnot, will end up leveraging better if we have better comp growth. So if we grow faster, we'll probably have bigger result, decreases, but we are quite committed to – we know that we're going to restructure some of the things that we do in the company. We're going to do a zero-based budgeting approach pretty much to all of our operations. We're making a significant investment with consultants to help us think through everything we're doing and we're committed to cutting these cost out. Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC All right. Thanks again guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to ask about the additional $300 million of cost savings. What areas will this come from generally? How does it differ from the $300 million that you're doing kind of this year? And do you think that the incremental $300 million drops to the bottom line or does that largely get reinvested? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, it's going to come from a variety of places. I mean, the main thing we're going to do be doing is we're going to be rethinking the way we do our labor scheduling. I mean, Whole Foods Market is in the early stages of labor scheduling technology and where we've applied it so far, it's been amazingly successful with getting the right people, the right number of hours scheduled in, say our customer service area. As we extend that through the whole company, we can get, we think we can upgrade our service while significantly reducing our cost. So that's going to be one of the major initiatives that we think is going to help reduce our labor cost in our stores, not through laying people off, but just through attrition over time and the appropriate scheduling. And then of course, with the help of the consultants as we rethink everything we're doing, when a company's been in rapid growth, like Whole Foods has been for so long, you inevitably pick up certain parts of your business, in your business model that aren't necessary. They don't create value for customers or for shareholders. As we get outside eyes to help us look at every part of our business, they're going to help us identify things that are not creating value for customers or our shareholders and we're going to eliminate them. So that's basically it. Jason, do you want to add anything to that? Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yeah. The only thing I'd add is I think we've talked about before, we've operated a highly regionalized company for many years and we've taken certain areas and we've really created a great hybrid model of our global support team, working with regional teams. And we continue to have opportunities in a lot of those global support functions where we can take it to other areas and that will also help us provide cost savings and hopefully speed to market. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. That's helpful. Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And, yes, we do expect the majority of those or all of those cost savings to flow through to the bottom line. That's how we get to the EBITDA margins that we're talking about in 2020. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yes, and common – this is David – common buying is not just the food but it's also goods not for sale and supplies and packaging and things like that. So again, we had operated with all the operating regions of Whole Foods Market buying on their own. And as we put that into global, in our global team, we're also seeing significant savings on just common buying in all areas of our business. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's all really helpful. And if I could just slip in the last one. Just maybe a little bit of additional color on category manage. Any specifics you could share or what the aim is there, what kind of things you're doing. And then finally just the structure of the loyalty program that you guys have settled on. What does that look like? And then I'll yield. Thanks a lot. A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Hi. So this is A.C. So on the category management side, as we've mentioned before, we started doing tests in our frozen category in two of our regions this past year and have had great – seen really great results from that. We're going to do our second test this summer dairy in a couple of the regions. And we're in the process right now of accelerating our plans so that we can start rolling out next fall with our full category management, category by category, throughout all of fiscal 2018, so that by the end of fiscal 2018 we'll have rolled out category management completely throughout the company. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And the last part of your question on affinity, as mentioned a little bit earlier, we're take some of the key functions, where we've seen a lot of success across our three pilots, we're not going to give very specific details on that today but what you'll see is some of the most amazing offers that we have as Whole Foods Market really driven through this program. And it will be collaborative with the category management pieces that A.C. just talked about and collaboration with our suppliers in bringing these great deals to our customers. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thank you. So I have a question on the process for determining the multi-year outlook. Maybe how was its development different than the plan you outlined back in 2014? And maybe what assumptions were in the 2014 about competition versus assumptions in today's multi-year plan about competitions? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, I'll just talk about our process this time around. As we've said, it was very much a bottom-up and very detailed level process where we looked at each initiative separately, and the impact that we expected on basket size and transaction count and our costs from every one of the initiatives underway. We did that in consultation with dunnhumby and our other advisors to develop something that is very realistic based on their experience with other retailers. And we rolled that up and then once we had that, we said okay, now, this is it. Let's go in and layer in what we expect to deliver in additional cost cuts over the next three years. And we did that. And, sort of, the high level picture of it is that, by 2020, all of these major initiatives will be fully implemented. So we'll be seeing the results from that on the top line and from marketing, from category management, from order-to-shelf, from affinity, we'll be seeing we'll have lower prices. So we will have lower margins but the vast majority of the lower margins will be paid for by cost savings that we expect from the category management process and from the purchasing restructuring. As somebody has said recently, we're moving basically from a federated system of purchasing to a unified system of purchasing and we expect to see a lot of cost sayings there. We already have some indications of that and we know that that's a very realistic expectation. And then you layer in the cost savings on top of that which will all flow directly to the bottom-line and that's how we get to the high-level targets that we have issued for 2020. William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC So it sounds to me like it's a more robust development than the prior plan with more external help. Is that fair? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. It's probably the most robust plan we have ever developed. William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi, good afternoon. So you've obviously taken some proactive steps from a corporate governance perspective with the changes at the board level. I was curious as to how involved the new members have been in the change in strategy at the company? Should we expect more change with their fresh perspective or what we see now is what we get? Just kind of curious as to your thoughts there. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, the new directors are just transitioning in so they haven't had any input yet into our strategic process. However, the full existing board has had a lot of input into our strategic process. And going forward, our evolved board will have a lot of input into our strategic process. And since we think we're gaining five new brilliant strategic business people, we're expecting lots of good ideas from them. And we're, frankly, thrilled and excited to be engaged with them. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. And then as we, sort of, think about the magnitude, I guess, of what you're looking to accomplish here and what needs to be done, it seems like there is obviously a lot to do. Do you have enough depth of management to execute on all this at this point? Or are you thinking about maybe bringing in some additional help? What else are you doing to ensure successful execution of all this? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we feel like we're well advised. We have a number of really excellent consulting firms we're working with and they're bringing their expertise. We've just announced hiring a new Chief Financial Officer that we think is going to add new depth to our leadership team and we will think about adding additional leadership as it's necessary to do so. So not sure how else I can answer that question. So thanks very much. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is open. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just to follow up on the cost structure dialogue, just wondering if you could... John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Charles, can you speak up a bit? Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors Yes. Just on the cost structure side, I was wondering if you could get a little bit more granular for us on where do you think you can eliminate costs within the 12 existing operating divisions of the company. And then just as a follow-up, on the loyalty, how quickly do you plan to roll that out? And I was wondering if Jason would be willing to shed a little bit of light on what the comp lift and basket changes look like since rolling that out in the test markets. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we did talk about already about the cost reductions, but we can add a little color maybe. Ken Meyer - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is Ken here. Two things that I think are very important in this. One, by having the 365 stores as a new way of thinking around how to operate our business, we are learning a lot. And we're learning about how to translate that back into the core stores at Whole Foods, whether it's through the use of technology, the use of simplified business process change, the way we merchandise in the stores, the fixturing. All of that is very powerful in how we're rethinking the way we want to transform the Whole Foods stores. And then the second area that we're seeing lots of learning and opportunity is through the order-to-shelf program. In that process, we're identifying how we can best transition our product to the store, identifying areas that we can eliminate steps that prove it to be more efficient and as well translate into better in-stock conditions and operating practices in our stores. And those are two very important components of how we see us transforming the business. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is David. I would also say, in our empowerment culture we have 90,000 team members helping us on this so we're all working together. And when Ken talks about order-to-shelf, the team members are really excited about that. They're really proud when they're able to achieve that, which is lower out-of-stocks, less inventory in the store, being able to be on the sales floor talking to customers and selling more products. So I think with us, different than other companies, when you get into cost cutting, it's everybody's together, working together to achieve these results. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And this is Jason, on your question on the affinity side, one of the things we're really focused on here is targeting our existing customers. Our customers are already in our stores. And one of the things that we've really seen in the program is the ability to incent them to grow their baskets. And, well, we're not going to provide a specific comp number on how that shows up over the course of the next few years, one of the tidbits we've shared is just by adding one additional item per trip amongst our core shoppers, which represents 40% of our sales, that's a $0.5 billion right there. And that's just one of the key things that we'll be aiming on with the focus of this program. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yes. And, again, a smaller test but the 365 stores with the affinity program, more than half of the sales is flowing through the customers we have or are part of the program. So we're really encouraged by that. We're learning a lot. And some of the fun ideas we've done in those four stores we're going to again feed back to the parent. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Quinn Burch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi. This is Quinn Burch on for Zack Fadem. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about your partnership with dunnhumby. I know it's early days, but if you could provide an update on the timeline thus far and how you plan to use the data with respect to category management, customer loyalty, and promo tracking. Any additional color on that would be helpful. Thank you. A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Hi. This is A.C. We're fully engaged now with dunnhumby. They have some of their folks onsite here working side by side with our team. As we are putting in – as we're hiring and developing our whole category management process, there's – they're helping introduce their tools, their proprietary tools that they have and working directly with our folks to learn those tools and implement them. Where it's really allowing us to – one of the main reasons that we wanted to go with dunnhumby, there's several, but one reason was that it would really help us accelerate our category management process. Originally, when we announced it, it was going to happen over the course of several years and we've been able to shorten that timeframe by a year by bringing dunnhumby in and accelerating that using their tools. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yeah. And this is Jason. I'll just add, dunnhumby is definitely a key partner for us in analytics and better understanding what our assortment needs to look like. We're also focused with two other major partners, Infor and Nielsen. And so together with all three of them, we really believe that we've got a lot of best-in-class data analytics and a partnership that's helping us quickly move through this process to deliver a great assortment and great prices for our customers. Quinn Burch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the sales initiatives. I think you mentioned the category management initiative has been tested in frozen in a couple of regions. So I was just curious, how much you – how much do you think you can extrapolate from the test that sounds pretty small at this point? It sounds like a key initiative to return to that comp, that positive comp by next year. So that's just the first question. And then the second question is on the affinity rollout. And I think I just heard you say about half your sales in the 365 were on the affinity program. I was just curious if you could provide any more metrics on how that was in Dallas and Philly. And if you think you have enough transactions that are being done on the affinity program for long enough to kind of extrapolate what that could mean for comps over the next couple years. Thank you. A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. One of the great opportunities for us in working with dunnhumby is that they have tremendous amount of experience working with retailers all over the world that have gone through the process of implementing category management. And it's through the results that we currently see and the work that we're doing with them that we've been able to model out what we really believe, we feel very confident. In fact, we think it's a little conservative, the results that we'll see as we roll category management out to all the other categories around the company. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is Jason. To your question on the affinity program. So within our Whole Foods Market stores, we have about 44% of sales running through that program. As David mentioned, we have just over 50% in our 365 tests within those four stores. Overall, that's about 200,000 customers that we currently have active in our program. So we've got a lot of data points from those customers around the various aspects of the program that really drive to sales. And as I mentioned earlier, a key part of this is really targeting our existing customers, our core customers and getting them to make an additional trip a month or adding additional item in their basket. And that's really a lot of the analysis we did into building out our long-term outlook. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. And just to follow up on that, category management, I mean what is the timeline for that process? Is that just kind of a new way of thinking and as an ongoing process? Or do you have a timeline for how long you think that entire process will take? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. I think we already said that. It's 2017 for affinity rollout and we'll have category management completely implemented by the end of 2018. That's the timeline. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Oh, hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just another one on the assumptions behind the 2020 revenue target. Can you maybe fill us in on how you're thinking about what your e-commerce business could look like then? And also just you guys are I think at $880 in sales per square foot right now, which is as you point out, pretty impressive. So I think you have to get probably back towards $900 or so or more to hit the $18 billion number just kind of roughly doing the store growth or sales square footage growth that you're looking at. Is this going to be transaction acceleration driven to get to your sales per square foot back to that level? Or is e-commerce involved? Just trying to understand how you take this already very high sales productivity to a whole another level while you're going to be lowering prices. Thanks. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is Jason. I'll start with your question on digital sales. So for us, that includes our partnership with Instacart, which is our sort of direct delivery to customers fulfilled out of our stores. It also includes our own e-store where we run a catering business and holiday meals. It also includes a number of other partners doing things like meal delivery. DoorDash is one of our partners in that space. And we also have a number of smaller initiatives we've done both with direct ship and click-and-collect. So our guidance in that space is sort of the collection of all those areas. It's been one of the fastest-growing parts of where we've seen sales growth within the company, as we have a lot of customers who are looking to engage with us online and having delivery of groceries. And we continue to be, I think, very aggressive in our thoughts as far as how that will contribute over the next four years. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And this is David. In terms of the increased sales per square foot, one thing to remember is Whole Foods is always on the move in terms of innovating our designs and the way our stores look. If you go to our new Lakeview store which just recently opened in Chicago. We roast coffee. We have two full bars. We have a friend who does juice in the store, Snap Kitchen. We have a lot of different concepts in that store and we continue to always be innovative, looking for new ways to grow our sales. And we're going to continue to invest our capital in our existing stores to accomplish that as well. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. So you asked a question about, so how are we going to – what's going to happen, are transaction's going to increase. Yes, we are going be investing in price significantly. We're going to turn around and take the category management savings that we get from purchasing economies and cutting, and reducing brokerage fees. That's all going to be reinvested in price. So we see that two areas are going to increase. We expect our transactions to increase as we lower our prices and close the gaps we have with other competitors. And secondly, we expect our, through affinity, we expect our basket size to grow significantly. So transactions will increase, basket size will grow and those will more than offset an average price that might be slightly lower. Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Thanks, John. Operator Your next question comes from Ryan Domyancic from William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan J. Domyancic - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I know you've really touched on this earlier on the call, but can you provide any more details on how the first class of 365 stores are performing? And then within that, like, how material do you think 365 will be to your 2020 growth targets for square footage? Thanks. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we're not going to give you the actual. We only have four stores, so we're not going to give you the actual individual breakdowns, but we have one extraordinary performer that's doing amazingly well. We have a new store that's opened up that's beating our projections. We have another store that's slightly below our projections and we have a fourth store that's underperformed our projections significantly, mostly because we think it was a bad real estate decision there. So in our own long-term outlook, we show 365 ramping up. And I forget how many stores we actually have in development. How many? David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. 22. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. We have 22 365 stores currently in our pipeline and we will be increasing that number. That's a number you can expect to grow. And we like the profit model that 365 delivers. We take out so many costs. The percentage to operate the stores is so much lower than a typical larger Whole Foods Market. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that Whole Foods has, but also has significantly lower capital cost. And I encourage people to come down and see our new store in Austin because it's 365 2.0. Those of you that saw the first-generation, we've made significant improvements. That's the way Whole Foods does thing. We continually upgrade and improve. And 365 has a new iteration and we're very happy with it and that's what you'll be seeing. We've got two more stores opening up this fiscal year, one in Santa Monica, that we know is going to be outstanding store and third store in Akron, Ohio. So 2.0 we think is going to be a great success and then 3.0 is going be better than that and that's just the way we do things at Whole Foods – constant improvement. Ryan J. Domyancic - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. John, where do you think your price gap versus the market is today? Where do you think it needs to go in order to improve price perception with both your existing and your more incremental customers? And my second question is, are you seeing positive comps across all the Whole Foods stores where your affinity program has been rolled out? Thank you so much. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we're not going to tell you the answer to all those questions. But, A.C., do you want to take the first part of that question? A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Sure. Yes, we've realized that in certain categories we are priced – we have a larger price differentiation with our customers – with our – versus our competitors than we need to and we're specifically targeting those areas through category management and through other purchasing initiatives so that we can get our costs down in order to be more competitive. At the same time, in a lot of areas, we're dealing with not the same products. For instance, our quality standards and our quality of product in our Meat and Seafood departments are always going to mean that our prices are going be a little bit higher. The important thing is to – for the right amount of differential there so that customers perceive the quality and the difference in price makes sense to them. We think in a few areas over the years that differential has gotten larger than it needs be and, as part of our plan, we're bringing that down to where we really believe that will be successful. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. It also depends upon which competitors in which markets, it's not exactly the same, and then some markets where you have a stronger competition than we have in other markets. So it's hard to generalize across the whole country. We do know we need to close the gap and we're determined to do so. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And on the affinity portion, we do not provide comp results by participating stores or tests that we do but we have seen both an increase in sales and trips amongst our members in all three tests. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. So we are getting comp lift in those affinity stores. We're just not going to discuss for how much. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC You said that those, the affinity members, are driving about 44% of the sales in those stores? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. 44% in the Whole Foods Market stores. A little higher in the 365 stores. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thank you so much. And good luck. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thanks. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two, actually. The first was just on your decision to raise the dividend 29%. If you guys could just talk us through how you got to that number? And then the second one was just if you could just give us some thoughts on how you guys are managing your capital structure. Looks like you guys should have a lot of debt capacity if you can hit your EBITDA targets. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we wanted to raise the dividend. I mean, I think as we explained in our script and on in our online presentation, the company is very dedicated to returning capital back to our shareholders. And as we've been talking to lots of investors over the last couple of years and getting their feedback on what they think the right, sort of – how do they like to have the capital returned, higher share backs, more dividends? And, honestly, they're kind of split down the middle. Some want more dividends. Some want more stock buy-backs. We do have more free cash flow than we need for our investments than we have for our own capital expenditures at this point. So we are committed to returning that excess capital to our shareholders and we have a consistent track record of doing so. So in discussing it with our financial advisors and talking about it with our Board of Directors, it was determined that we should increase both. And we increased the dividend, frankly, to get it to a 2% yield. We think at a 2% yield, we'll attract a certain investor class that maybe hasn't looked at Whole Foods until we get to that yield. So that was deliberately set to get to a 2% yield. And then stock buy-back is somewhat based on what we think the right capital structure the company should have in terms of between equity and debt. And that was, again, talking to our financial advisors about that. And the board discussing it and that's what we came up with. Glenda, do you want to add anything? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yes. I mean, you're exactly right. The Whole Foods Market is producing very strong cash flow. And it's pretty easy for us to support that increase in the dividend and increase in buybacks. We've returned over $3 billion to the shareholders over the – since 2012 and we want to continue with those returns. Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Great. Thanks. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Okay. So we're getting to the end of this call but I do want to call out this is going to be the last earnings call that our Chief Financial Officer, Glenda Flanagan, will ever participate in. As she's pointed out, she's participated in over 100 of these board calls since we went public back in 1992. I don't think she's missed any. But Glenda has been amazing. She's well loved by the entire leadership team at Whole Foods. She's been a great Chief Financial Officer. She's been my partner. I've worked very closely with her for a long time. And we've got a great new CFO coming in. But there's only one Glenda and we love her. And the good news is, is that she's not going to be the Chief Financial Officer anymore but she's going to still be in an advisory capacity with our company and we're still going to get to work with her. So those of you that know her, I hope you will congratulate her for a really great job that she's done for, gosh, since 1988. Longest tenured Chief Financial Officer in the Fortune Female 500. Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thank you, John. That's very sweet. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. You're welcome. Thank you for your continued interest in our company. We look forward to hearing your thoughts as we move forward. Please join us in July for our third quarter earnings call. Good bye, everybody. Operator This concludes today's conference call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to first ask about your margin guidance. You're looking for an increase in the EBITDA margin of 90 basis points over the next few years, decrease in SG&A of about 150. So just quick math, assuming all else equal, more of a modest gross margin investment, more like 60 basis points, than I think some of us were expecting. So first I'm curious, is that generally accurate? And if I'm missing something, please let me know. And second, if it is, I'm just curious why the investment doesn't have to be any larger? Maybe it's related to the comments in your press release about the upgraded purchasing program. Perhaps that's a little bit more of a driver than what I was realizing. Just any help there would be very much appreciated. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thanks. That's a good question. I think the thing it's not being shown there is we are expecting to gain significant savings in category management on the purchasing side. And we're going to – all of the money that we're going to save through category management, we're going to turn around and invest in lower prices. So there's actually going be a significant reduction in prices while maintaining similar gross margins. So I think that's the answer. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. I know others have, I'm sure, eager to get on. I'll pass it along. Thanks, John. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thanks again for all the details. Curious on what gives you confidence in getting back to positive comp growth later next fiscal year? And is there anything you can point to currently – it sounds like affinity has gotten off to a good start from what you guys have seen with your pilot test, but just trying to get a sense of what gives you guys confidence in getting back to positive comp growth. If you could maybe provide a little color there? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Actually that's a bottom-up. We did a lot of work on this. And we factored in the sales gains we believe we're going to get from affinity based on our test as well as the sales gains we're going to get from our initial category management tests that we've been doing. So we've seen strong sales lifts in the area – in the pilots for category management and in our pilots for affinity. So we basically have just extended that through the entire company. And those were the two major drivers. Plus, we think our marketing initiatives, particularly our advertising, is going to compound over time. So these – we actually think these are realistic and probably slightly conservative comp projections. But they're based on the internal calculations. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yeah, this is Jason. On the affinity side, we've taken sort of our proven results with the pilots as well as talking with our strategic partners in implementing this to make sure that the guidance we're providing there matches what's seen in other programs as we rolled it out. And we're just, quite honestly, really excited about the results we've seen across all three of our tests and are taking the very best of those parts of those programs and rolling it out companywide. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is David. The other thing I would add is our order-to-shelf initiative as we roll out that across all of our stores, each store as we go online with order-to-shelf, we see a significant reduction in out-of-stock. So again, customers can't buy it if it's not on the shelf. So we feel that's also going to help us with our comp growth. Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Okay, great. Best of luck with your efforts. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is open. Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Just to jump back to the three-year guidance. I may have missed it given all the information out there, but what's your expected unit growth for the next three years if you want to hit that $18 billion in sales? And if you have to potentially pull back on the planned unit growth or possibly close some stores, how does it affect your ability to reach that 27% SG&A as a percentage of sales number? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. I missed your last question, but this is Glenda. The answer to the number of units, we didn't give a specific number of units but we did say square footage growth. We do expect the square footage growth to be less than 5% for the years between now and then. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And. Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC Sorry. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And those stores growth is going to basically fall into three buckets. We're going to be relocating smaller stores to bigger, more flagship type locations because we've had such tremendous success with those stores like we've done recently in Philadelphia, Chicago, New York. Those stores do outperform and do extremely well. Secondly, we will be having more 365 stores. We just opened a store a couple of weeks ago in Austin, Texas, our 365 2.0 initiative. We're very encouraged with the initial results. Sales have been very strong there. And as we continue to test and refine our 365 model, can anticipate growth in there beginning to accelerate over time. In terms of closing more stores, I mean it's possible in the future we may close a few stores, but almost all the stores that we currently have operating have positive EBITDAR. So there'd be no cash gain from closing stores that are making cash for the company. And what was your secondary question? Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC Yeah, the second part of it was just if in fact do you have to augment that unit growth over the long term, does this affect your ability to reach that 27% SG&A as a percentage of sales number? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. If we grow faster, we'll reach it quicker because we'll have more sales leverage. And that will take our expense, like G&A, and some of the other fixed expenses, depreciation and whatnot, will end up leveraging better if we have better comp growth. So if we grow faster, we'll probably have bigger result, decreases, but we are quite committed to – we know that we're going to restructure some of the things that we do in the company. We're going to do a zero-based budgeting approach pretty much to all of our operations. We're making a significant investment with consultants to help us think through everything we're doing and we're committed to cutting these cost out. Christopher Mandeville - Jefferies LLC All right. Thanks again guys. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I just wanted to ask about the additional $300 million of cost savings. What areas will this come from generally? How does it differ from the $300 million that you're doing kind of this year? And do you think that the incremental $300 million drops to the bottom line or does that largely get reinvested? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, it's going to come from a variety of places. I mean, the main thing we're going to do be doing is we're going to be rethinking the way we do our labor scheduling. I mean, Whole Foods Market is in the early stages of labor scheduling technology and where we've applied it so far, it's been amazingly successful with getting the right people, the right number of hours scheduled in, say our customer service area. As we extend that through the whole company, we can get, we think we can upgrade our service while significantly reducing our cost. So that's going to be one of the major initiatives that we think is going to help reduce our labor cost in our stores, not through laying people off, but just through attrition over time and the appropriate scheduling. And then of course, with the help of the consultants as we rethink everything we're doing, when a company's been in rapid growth, like Whole Foods has been for so long, you inevitably pick up certain parts of your business, in your business model that aren't necessary. They don't create value for customers or for shareholders. As we get outside eyes to help us look at every part of our business, they're going to help us identify things that are not creating value for customers or our shareholders and we're going to eliminate them. So that's basically it. Jason, do you want to add anything to that? Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yeah. The only thing I'd add is I think we've talked about before, we've operated a highly regionalized company for many years and we've taken certain areas and we've really created a great hybrid model of our global support team, working with regional teams. And we continue to have opportunities in a lot of those global support functions where we can take it to other areas and that will also help us provide cost savings and hopefully speed to market. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. That's helpful. Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And, yes, we do expect the majority of those or all of those cost savings to flow through to the bottom line. That's how we get to the EBITDA margins that we're talking about in 2020. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yes, and common – this is David – common buying is not just the food but it's also goods not for sale and supplies and packaging and things like that. So again, we had operated with all the operating regions of Whole Foods Market buying on their own. And as we put that into global, in our global team, we're also seeing significant savings on just common buying in all areas of our business. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's all really helpful. And if I could just slip in the last one. Just maybe a little bit of additional color on category manage. Any specifics you could share or what the aim is there, what kind of things you're doing. And then finally just the structure of the loyalty program that you guys have settled on. What does that look like? And then I'll yield. Thanks a lot. A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Hi. So this is A.C. So on the category management side, as we've mentioned before, we started doing tests in our frozen category in two of our regions this past year and have had great – seen really great results from that. We're going to do our second test this summer dairy in a couple of the regions. And we're in the process right now of accelerating our plans so that we can start rolling out next fall with our full category management, category by category, throughout all of fiscal 2018, so that by the end of fiscal 2018 we'll have rolled out category management completely throughout the company. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And the last part of your question on affinity, as mentioned a little bit earlier, we're take some of the key functions, where we've seen a lot of success across our three pilots, we're not going to give very specific details on that today but what you'll see is some of the most amazing offers that we have as Whole Foods Market really driven through this program. And it will be collaborative with the category management pieces that A.C. just talked about and collaboration with our suppliers in bringing these great deals to our customers. Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks so much, guys. Appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bill Kirk from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC Thank you. So I have a question on the process for determining the multi-year outlook. Maybe how was its development different than the plan you outlined back in 2014? And maybe what assumptions were in the 2014 about competition versus assumptions in today's multi-year plan about competitions? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, I'll just talk about our process this time around. As we've said, it was very much a bottom-up and very detailed level process where we looked at each initiative separately, and the impact that we expected on basket size and transaction count and our costs from every one of the initiatives underway. We did that in consultation with dunnhumby and our other advisors to develop something that is very realistic based on their experience with other retailers. And we rolled that up and then once we had that, we said okay, now, this is it. Let's go in and layer in what we expect to deliver in additional cost cuts over the next three years. And we did that. And, sort of, the high level picture of it is that, by 2020, all of these major initiatives will be fully implemented. So we'll be seeing the results from that on the top line and from marketing, from category management, from order-to-shelf, from affinity, we'll be seeing we'll have lower prices. So we will have lower margins but the vast majority of the lower margins will be paid for by cost savings that we expect from the category management process and from the purchasing restructuring. As somebody has said recently, we're moving basically from a federated system of purchasing to a unified system of purchasing and we expect to see a lot of cost sayings there. We already have some indications of that and we know that that's a very realistic expectation. And then you layer in the cost savings on top of that which will all flow directly to the bottom-line and that's how we get to the high-level targets that we have issued for 2020. William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC So it sounds to me like it's a more robust development than the prior plan with more external help. Is that fair? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. It's probably the most robust plan we have ever developed. William Kirk - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hi, good afternoon. So you've obviously taken some proactive steps from a corporate governance perspective with the changes at the board level. I was curious as to how involved the new members have been in the change in strategy at the company? Should we expect more change with their fresh perspective or what we see now is what we get? Just kind of curious as to your thoughts there. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, the new directors are just transitioning in so they haven't had any input yet into our strategic process. However, the full existing board has had a lot of input into our strategic process. And going forward, our evolved board will have a lot of input into our strategic process. And since we think we're gaining five new brilliant strategic business people, we're expecting lots of good ideas from them. And we're, frankly, thrilled and excited to be engaged with them. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. And then as we, sort of, think about the magnitude, I guess, of what you're looking to accomplish here and what needs to be done, it seems like there is obviously a lot to do. Do you have enough depth of management to execute on all this at this point? Or are you thinking about maybe bringing in some additional help? What else are you doing to ensure successful execution of all this? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we feel like we're well advised. We have a number of really excellent consulting firms we're working with and they're bringing their expertise. We've just announced hiring a new Chief Financial Officer that we think is going to add new depth to our leadership team and we will think about adding additional leadership as it's necessary to do so. So not sure how else I can answer that question. So thanks very much. Edward J. Kelly - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett Research Advisors. Your line is open. Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just to follow up on the cost structure dialogue, just wondering if you could... John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Charles, can you speak up a bit? Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett Research Advisors Yes. Just on the cost structure side, I was wondering if you could get a little bit more granular for us on where do you think you can eliminate costs within the 12 existing operating divisions of the company. And then just as a follow-up, on the loyalty, how quickly do you plan to roll that out? And I was wondering if Jason would be willing to shed a little bit of light on what the comp lift and basket changes look like since rolling that out in the test markets. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we did talk about already about the cost reductions, but we can add a little color maybe. Ken Meyer - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is Ken here. Two things that I think are very important in this. One, by having the 365 stores as a new way of thinking around how to operate our business, we are learning a lot. And we're learning about how to translate that back into the core stores at Whole Foods, whether it's through the use of technology, the use of simplified business process change, the way we merchandise in the stores, the fixturing. All of that is very powerful in how we're rethinking the way we want to transform the Whole Foods stores. And then the second area that we're seeing lots of learning and opportunity is through the order-to-shelf program. In that process, we're identifying how we can best transition our product to the store, identifying areas that we can eliminate steps that prove it to be more efficient and as well translate into better in-stock conditions and operating practices in our stores. And those are two very important components of how we see us transforming the business. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is David. I would also say, in our empowerment culture we have 90,000 team members helping us on this so we're all working together. And when Ken talks about order-to-shelf, the team members are really excited about that. They're really proud when they're able to achieve that, which is lower out-of-stocks, less inventory in the store, being able to be on the sales floor talking to customers and selling more products. So I think with us, different than other companies, when you get into cost cutting, it's everybody's together, working together to achieve these results. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And this is Jason, on your question on the affinity side, one of the things we're really focused on here is targeting our existing customers. Our customers are already in our stores. And one of the things that we've really seen in the program is the ability to incent them to grow their baskets. And, well, we're not going to provide a specific comp number on how that shows up over the course of the next few years, one of the tidbits we've shared is just by adding one additional item per trip amongst our core shoppers, which represents 40% of our sales, that's a $0.5 billion right there. And that's just one of the key things that we'll be aiming on with the focus of this program. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yes. And, again, a smaller test but the 365 stores with the affinity program, more than half of the sales is flowing through the customers we have or are part of the program. So we're really encouraged by that. We're learning a lot. And some of the fun ideas we've done in those four stores we're going to again feed back to the parent. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Zack Fadem from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Quinn Burch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Hi. This is Quinn Burch on for Zack Fadem. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about your partnership with dunnhumby. I know it's early days, but if you could provide an update on the timeline thus far and how you plan to use the data with respect to category management, customer loyalty, and promo tracking. Any additional color on that would be helpful. Thank you. A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Hi. This is A.C. We're fully engaged now with dunnhumby. They have some of their folks onsite here working side by side with our team. As we are putting in – as we're hiring and developing our whole category management process, there's – they're helping introduce their tools, their proprietary tools that they have and working directly with our folks to learn those tools and implement them. Where it's really allowing us to – one of the main reasons that we wanted to go with dunnhumby, there's several, but one reason was that it would really help us accelerate our category management process. Originally, when we announced it, it was going to happen over the course of several years and we've been able to shorten that timeframe by a year by bringing dunnhumby in and accelerating that using their tools. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yeah. And this is Jason. I'll just add, dunnhumby is definitely a key partner for us in analytics and better understanding what our assortment needs to look like. We're also focused with two other major partners, Infor and Nielsen. And so together with all three of them, we really believe that we've got a lot of best-in-class data analytics and a partnership that's helping us quickly move through this process to deliver a great assortment and great prices for our customers. Quinn Burch - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is open. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the sales initiatives. I think you mentioned the category management initiative has been tested in frozen in a couple of regions. So I was just curious, how much you – how much do you think you can extrapolate from the test that sounds pretty small at this point? It sounds like a key initiative to return to that comp, that positive comp by next year. So that's just the first question. And then the second question is on the affinity rollout. And I think I just heard you say about half your sales in the 365 were on the affinity program. I was just curious if you could provide any more metrics on how that was in Dallas and Philly. And if you think you have enough transactions that are being done on the affinity program for long enough to kind of extrapolate what that could mean for comps over the next couple years. Thank you. A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. One of the great opportunities for us in working with dunnhumby is that they have tremendous amount of experience working with retailers all over the world that have gone through the process of implementing category management. And it's through the results that we currently see and the work that we're doing with them that we've been able to model out what we really believe, we feel very confident. In fact, we think it's a little conservative, the results that we'll see as we roll category management out to all the other categories around the company. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is Jason. To your question on the affinity program. So within our Whole Foods Market stores, we have about 44% of sales running through that program. As David mentioned, we have just over 50% in our 365 tests within those four stores. Overall, that's about 200,000 customers that we currently have active in our program. So we've got a lot of data points from those customers around the various aspects of the program that really drive to sales. And as I mentioned earlier, a key part of this is really targeting our existing customers, our core customers and getting them to make an additional trip a month or adding additional item in their basket. And that's really a lot of the analysis we did into building out our long-term outlook. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. And just to follow up on that, category management, I mean what is the timeline for that process? Is that just kind of a new way of thinking and as an ongoing process? Or do you have a timeline for how long you think that entire process will take? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. I think we already said that. It's 2017 for affinity rollout and we'll have category management completely implemented by the end of 2018. That's the timeline. Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Oh, hey. Thanks for taking my question. Just another one on the assumptions behind the 2020 revenue target. Can you maybe fill us in on how you're thinking about what your e-commerce business could look like then? And also just you guys are I think at $880 in sales per square foot right now, which is as you point out, pretty impressive. So I think you have to get probably back towards $900 or so or more to hit the $18 billion number just kind of roughly doing the store growth or sales square footage growth that you're looking at. Is this going to be transaction acceleration driven to get to your sales per square foot back to that level? Or is e-commerce involved? Just trying to understand how you take this already very high sales productivity to a whole another level while you're going to be lowering prices. Thanks. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. This is Jason. I'll start with your question on digital sales. So for us, that includes our partnership with Instacart, which is our sort of direct delivery to customers fulfilled out of our stores. It also includes our own e-store where we run a catering business and holiday meals. It also includes a number of other partners doing things like meal delivery. DoorDash is one of our partners in that space. And we also have a number of smaller initiatives we've done both with direct ship and click-and-collect. So our guidance in that space is sort of the collection of all those areas. It's been one of the fastest-growing parts of where we've seen sales growth within the company, as we have a lot of customers who are looking to engage with us online and having delivery of groceries. And we continue to be, I think, very aggressive in our thoughts as far as how that will contribute over the next four years. David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And this is David. In terms of the increased sales per square foot, one thing to remember is Whole Foods is always on the move in terms of innovating our designs and the way our stores look. If you go to our new Lakeview store which just recently opened in Chicago. We roast coffee. We have two full bars. We have a friend who does juice in the store, Snap Kitchen. We have a lot of different concepts in that store and we continue to always be innovative, looking for new ways to grow our sales. And we're going to continue to invest our capital in our existing stores to accomplish that as well. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. So you asked a question about, so how are we going to – what's going to happen, are transaction's going to increase. Yes, we are going be investing in price significantly. We're going to turn around and take the category management savings that we get from purchasing economies and cutting, and reducing brokerage fees. That's all going to be reinvested in price. So we see that two areas are going to increase. We expect our transactions to increase as we lower our prices and close the gaps we have with other competitors. And secondly, we expect our, through affinity, we expect our basket size to grow significantly. So transactions will increase, basket size will grow and those will more than offset an average price that might be slightly lower. Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Thanks, John. Operator Your next question comes from Ryan Domyancic from William Blair. Your line is open. Ryan J. Domyancic - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I know you've really touched on this earlier on the call, but can you provide any more details on how the first class of 365 stores are performing? And then within that, like, how material do you think 365 will be to your 2020 growth targets for square footage? Thanks. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we're not going to give you the actual. We only have four stores, so we're not going to give you the actual individual breakdowns, but we have one extraordinary performer that's doing amazingly well. We have a new store that's opened up that's beating our projections. We have another store that's slightly below our projections and we have a fourth store that's underperformed our projections significantly, mostly because we think it was a bad real estate decision there. So in our own long-term outlook, we show 365 ramping up. And I forget how many stores we actually have in development. How many? David Lannon - Whole Foods Market, Inc. 22. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. We have 22 365 stores currently in our pipeline and we will be increasing that number. That's a number you can expect to grow. And we like the profit model that 365 delivers. We take out so many costs. The percentage to operate the stores is so much lower than a typical larger Whole Foods Market. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that Whole Foods has, but also has significantly lower capital cost. And I encourage people to come down and see our new store in Austin because it's 365 2.0. Those of you that saw the first-generation, we've made significant improvements. That's the way Whole Foods does thing. We continually upgrade and improve. And 365 has a new iteration and we're very happy with it and that's what you'll be seeing. We've got two more stores opening up this fiscal year, one in Santa Monica, that we know is going to be outstanding store and third store in Akron, Ohio. So 2.0 we think is going to be a great success and then 3.0 is going be better than that and that's just the way we do things at Whole Foods – constant improvement. Ryan J. Domyancic - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. John, where do you think your price gap versus the market is today? Where do you think it needs to go in order to improve price perception with both your existing and your more incremental customers? And my second question is, are you seeing positive comps across all the Whole Foods stores where your affinity program has been rolled out? Thank you so much. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we're not going to tell you the answer to all those questions. But, A.C., do you want to take the first part of that question? A.C. Gallo - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Sure. Yes, we've realized that in certain categories we are priced – we have a larger price differentiation with our customers – with our – versus our competitors than we need to and we're specifically targeting those areas through category management and through other purchasing initiatives so that we can get our costs down in order to be more competitive. At the same time, in a lot of areas, we're dealing with not the same products. For instance, our quality standards and our quality of product in our Meat and Seafood departments are always going to mean that our prices are going be a little bit higher. The important thing is to – for the right amount of differential there so that customers perceive the quality and the difference in price makes sense to them. We think in a few areas over the years that differential has gotten larger than it needs be and, as part of our plan, we're bringing that down to where we really believe that will be successful. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. It also depends upon which competitors in which markets, it's not exactly the same, and then some markets where you have a stronger competition than we have in other markets. So it's hard to generalize across the whole country. We do know we need to close the gap and we're determined to do so. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Thanks. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. And on the affinity portion, we do not provide comp results by participating stores or tests that we do but we have seen both an increase in sales and trips amongst our members in all three tests. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. So we are getting comp lift in those affinity stores. We're just not going to discuss for how much. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC You said that those, the affinity members, are driving about 44% of the sales in those stores? John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. 44% in the Whole Foods Market stores. A little higher in the 365 stores. Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thank you so much. And good luck. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thanks. Jason J. Buechel - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thanks. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks for taking the questions. I just had two, actually. The first was just on your decision to raise the dividend 29%. If you guys could just talk us through how you got to that number? And then the second one was just if you could just give us some thoughts on how you guys are managing your capital structure. Looks like you guys should have a lot of debt capacity if you can hit your EBITDA targets. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Well, we wanted to raise the dividend. I mean, I think as we explained in our script and on in our online presentation, the company is very dedicated to returning capital back to our shareholders. And as we've been talking to lots of investors over the last couple of years and getting their feedback on what they think the right, sort of – how do they like to have the capital returned, higher share backs, more dividends? And, honestly, they're kind of split down the middle. Some want more dividends. Some want more stock buy-backs. We do have more free cash flow than we need for our investments than we have for our own capital expenditures at this point. So we are committed to returning that excess capital to our shareholders and we have a consistent track record of doing so. So in discussing it with our financial advisors and talking about it with our Board of Directors, it was determined that we should increase both. And we increased the dividend, frankly, to get it to a 2% yield. We think at a 2% yield, we'll attract a certain investor class that maybe hasn't looked at Whole Foods until we get to that yield. So that was deliberately set to get to a 2% yield. And then stock buy-back is somewhat based on what we think the right capital structure the company should have in terms of between equity and debt. And that was, again, talking to our financial advisors about that. And the board discussing it and that's what we came up with. Glenda, do you want to add anything? Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Yes. I mean, you're exactly right. The Whole Foods Market is producing very strong cash flow. And it's pretty easy for us to support that increase in the dividend and increase in buybacks. We've returned over $3 billion to the shareholders over the – since 2012 and we want to continue with those returns. Shane Higgins - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. All right. Great. Thanks. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Okay. So we're getting to the end of this call but I do want to call out this is going to be the last earnings call that our Chief Financial Officer, Glenda Flanagan, will ever participate in. As she's pointed out, she's participated in over 100 of these board calls since we went public back in 1992. I don't think she's missed any. But Glenda has been amazing. She's well loved by the entire leadership team at Whole Foods. She's been a great Chief Financial Officer. She's been my partner. I've worked very closely with her for a long time. And we've got a great new CFO coming in. But there's only one Glenda and we love her. And the good news is, is that she's not going to be the Chief Financial Officer anymore but she's going to still be in an advisory capacity with our company and we're still going to get to work with her. So those of you that know her, I hope you will congratulate her for a really great job that she's done for, gosh, since 1988. Longest tenured Chief Financial Officer in the Fortune Female 500. Glenda Jane Flanagan - Whole Foods Market, Inc. Thank you, John. That's very sweet. John P. Mackey - Whole Foods Market, Inc. You're welcome. Thank you for your continued interest in our company. We look forward to hearing your thoughts as we move forward. Please join us in July for our third quarter earnings call. Good bye, everybody. Operator This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Lavarielle [ph], and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Craig Billings, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. Craig Billings Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. With me in Las Vegas is Steve Wynn, Matt Maddox, Kim Sinatra, Maurice Wooden, Ciaran Carruthers. Also on the line are our colleagues in Macau, Las Vegas and Boston. Just a reminder for today, we will be making forward-looking statements under Safe Harbor securities law and those statements may or may not come true. With that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Wynn. Stephen Wynn Okay. You can see the numbers. Business is good for us. We've been joining a research and sub activity at the top-end in China. Our hotels there - we're enjoying the continuing prosperity of Wynn Macau and the steady growth of Wynn Palace pursuant to plans and the expectations we've had since the inception of that project. When we opened the hotel in Cotai this past August, we had 9% of the market. In the first quarter, we went to 13%, and now we're moving past 16% of market share. So that's in spite of the fact that we are still surrounded by barricades and construction. Now, it happens to be sort of a mixed message. The construction interference in traffic and the isolation of our hotel is at an all-time high. But it's at an all-time high, because the level of activity has increased, I'm happy to say, immeasurably, especially in the monorail, light-rail station that is right in front of our hotel and provides the greatest obstacle to movement of people. But they are installing the escalators and there is a new contractor. And they seem to have a whole new energy and vitality in getting the transportation system of - the transportation system that benefits us enormously. The new ferry terminal is about to open, the monorail goes from there, the light-rail goes from the ferry terminal and all of that, straight into Cotai. And it goes around our property on two sides, and we're the first stop. And the people in it experience our lake and our fountains, and then they stop right at our gondola. That construction has been a tremendous barricade, I mean, literally a wall. And now that seems to be getting to the stage where not only will it be completed later this spring, that part of it, but also the pedestrian crossover which is part of that construction will be available to us. At about the same time this summer or this fall that MGM opens their construction activity and the blockage of the street is in an all-time high, which is associated with the end game, the last four months of construction or five months of construction that MGM is experiencing and the activity on our south side at SJM has also accelerated. So we are blocked out, but on the other hand, there is good news ahead as the time between our suffering and our relief gets shorter. The hotel at Palace has been turned out from a guest point of view very sticky. People stay with us coming back again, and again, filling the hotel and we're happy about that. So Macau is a story of our neighbors and surrounding construction. Everything is moving along well. Ciaran Carruthers is here in Las Vegas with me, runs Wynn Macau. Ian is on the telephone in Macau. And both of those men and our financial people are available for answers. In Las Vegas, Maurice Wooden is sitting next to me. And we had the biggest hotel quarter in the history of the company. Our revenues were up 9%. And our cash was up and we had a really good quarter. And we come to a final decision that I'll discuss in a few minutes, and about the golf course and that development. Bob DeSalvio is on the call in Boston. We started construction in July. It's a 34-month job. They're slightly ahead of their schedule. We're eight months into it and - seven or eight months into it. The job is bought out. The GMP is finished and the project is bought out. And we're on our way to April/May opening in 24, 25 months from now. And again, men are available for questions. So I'm going to take a moment and bring everybody up to date on the project that has occupied a great deal of our attention from the last 12 months. And that is redevelopment of the golf course. The golf course rose $7.3 million, netted [$3.5 million, $3.3 million or $3.5 million] [ph]. 46 people played golf. And that's very nice. It's a beautiful [indiscernible] golf course. But as a business, it's always a placeholder, since we bought the place in the desert in the 2000. That period is now concluded. It is no longer a placeholder. It's a development site. Construction will begin in December and January, and the first phase of it will go rather quickly. What we decided after a year of development of fanciful and really imaginative ideas that include a mountain and features and gondolas and restaurants and nightclubs and hotel towers. As we realized that we had a pressing issue in the company now, we have a very, very healthy convention and catering business in this hotel, and we get a big premium for our space. And we have our shows that are stationed, that headquarter here are getting bigger every year and they are outgrowing us. And my colleague, Chris Ann-Flad [ph] who has been with me since the Mirage deal days, when we built Mirage, and she came from Caesars. Chris has been asking for more space. She wanted just under 100,000 feet of convention, ballroom space 86,000 feet, and she wanted another 60,000 or 70,000 feet of meeting rooms. And in order to accommodate the business that we are dealing to now, and it had a certain profit level because of the catering cost plus business, it had a certain impact on our occupancy of 8% or 9%. And when feathered into our retail food and beverage, and casino business it had a certain worst-case impact on EBITDA of $50 million or more. So we said, all right, we got all these great ideas that are going into this lagoon, and this beachfront property, but what should we do to take the most conservative but dynamic approach to this property. And after all of the studies and the pricing, we came to this conclusion. That we were going to build, we would master plan the entire event, but we would build the beachfront meeting space, ballrooms, cabanas and pools that represented the certain need we had at the moment. Build the lagoon, 1,500 feet long and 800 odd feet wide with 4,000 foot boardwalk with white sand beaches and water-sports and attractions, bar and food service. Build that first. That would energize the real estate that the 130-odd-acres that is the golf course with its water rights. And we would put this 20-odd-acre lagoon in the middle of it. And then we would build our meeting space, leave room for our new tower that could be a couple of thousand rooms. We would leave room for everything master plan it, but build at first the park that would immediately power up our existing restaurants, our existing casino, our existing convention meeting and catering operation. With an absolute certain return on that investment of excessive 10% or 15%. We have no better use for our money, we keep $1.5 billion or $2 billion in the parent company. And this would allow us to take the most conservative, but the most dynamic approach to creating this. We can affect this tremendous uptick in the value of our surrounding real estate. And that's what we decided to do and that's what we've committed to plans and that's with the Board of Directors has approved, and that is now a project. And hard construction will commence in six or seven months because we are doing the drawings as we speak, and we've been for a month or two. But we'll do this with complete drawings and firm prices with guaranteed maxes and liquidated damages and all the other things we do to protect ourselves. So that's the formula and we'll spend between $400 million to $500 million on it. And we'll get the lagoon and these things up pretty quick. By start at the beginning of the year, we should be in shape within a year or so, it goes very fast. And that's pretty much the state of things. I think I'll let the rest of this time today be left to answering questions directed either at us or China or Boston. So go ahead with questions, Ma'am. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli Hey, thanks. And thank you for the explanation on Paradise Park. And as you think about the master-plan longer term, I know when you guys originally kind of proposed the idea back in April at the Analyst Day, a hotel and kind of broader scope was attributed to it. Could we kind of look at it today and say, okay, Cotai is up and running, Macau is doing a little bit better, but - and you guys are being a little bit more conservative with this spend, going forward with the elements of the project that you think have high-return associated with them in the near-term and then could potentially branch into something larger with potential additional hotel towers more similar to the original contemplation down the road? Stephen Wynn I couldn't have said it better myself, Carlo. Carlo Santarelli Okay. Okay. That's easy then. And then on… Stephen Wynn Would you, if I may? Carlo Santarelli Yes. Stephen Wynn This idea, if you build it they'll come, has been something that I've done for the past 40 odd years. But I've never had an opportunity that was so rich in options in my entire career in Las Vegas. This golf course and this lagoon and the beach-run property, every time we turn around someone else comes to see us to do something else with it or to buy a piece or to rent a piece or to do a JV. And it's been very exciting. So I say, well, before I build my idea of a thing to go on that section, let's put it out there, let's feel it, let's live with it for a while, let's give everybody a chance to appreciate how dynamic this location is and how powerful the opportunity is. Maybe we miss something. Every once in a while, when you're a wide-eyed developer like myself, and my colleagues, it's good to take a beat and so we did. Carlo Santarelli Understood, and then if - maybe somebody could help out here. Obviously, you guys had some favorables on the VIP hold side, maybe a little bit of light mass hold that looked like at Peninsula. But when you look at each of the three assets, could you guys kind of give us what your sense was for normalized property level, EBITDA metrics? Stephen Wynn Nothing in China and a few million bucks in Vegas. Carlo Santarelli Okay. Craig Billings All right, the direct hold was low and the junket hold was high. So when you look at it, there really was no hold impact on the Peninsula. Carlo Santarelli Okay. And now, that was - so the three-three you were saying on the junket side is the junket side plays favorable, the direct side played weak and kind of mitigate it. Craig Billings That's right. Carlo Santarelli Okay. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Stephen Wynn Sure. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Joseph Greff Good afternoon, everybody. Just so we maybe can get a sense of how to think about normalized margins on the Peninsula. I know there was a collection benefit and you had them from time-to-time and I understand how you reserved for outstanding credit. But can you talk about what that impact may have been at Peninsula in the 1Q, just so we get a sense of how to think about normalized property level EBITDA margin? Craig Billings Hey, Joe, it was about $5.5 million. Joseph Greff Got that. Great. And is it your sense that the rate of outstanding credits being paid off and [that is that's] [ph] benefiting for you and others on the VIP side at Macau, is that starting to plateau or is there - do you feel that sustainable? Stephen Wynn You can answer that question. Ian Coughlan This is Ian in Macau. We've had some favorable collection of credit. And it certainly seems to be tied in with the stronger credit market in general and it has benefited for us for a number of quarters. Joseph Greff Okay. And maybe just a big picture for you, Steve, you referenced obviously a resurgence in the high-end, the top-end in China. It surely manifested in the numbers you reported tonight. What do you think as driving that? And how sustainable are those drivers from here? I don't know if anybody has the right answer for that, but if you can share with us your view. Stephen Wynn I have a picture - I have an opinion on that. And of course, it's just my opinion. But I've said in these calls in the past that it would be a mistake to misunderstand the primary underlying driver of the Chinese economy. It is a massive thing and when you say that as I have in the past that we have a very positive and bullish look forward into our long-term position in Macau, at some point the long-term vision and the short-term begin to meld as they are now. The suppression of the VIP market was something that was the result organically of a process that the administration of President Xi Jinping thought was appropriate for the country, the elimination of corruption. And it had secondary effects on high-end products like shopping, and automobiles, and gaming was part of that. But having made a corrective move in China there comes a point when the corrective move, it sort of finishes. And although corruption is still a major item in the PRC, the initial impact has softened, because so much of the work that they thought had to be done, was done. And so people begin to return to normal spending habits, and they are not so strongly influenced by public policy issues that involve public officials. So the people are settling back into routines that they're comfortable with, and that includes going to Macau and buying a new car or shopping at Louis Vuitton. And we've always been part of that cycle, and it wasn't going to be permanent, and we've said that before. Long-term strength of the Chinese concession is one of the most precious assets in modern day. And we are just been seeing it. And another thing, they limited the expansion of Macau in a number of ways. First, by the real estate that is available. The last hotels to be built are being built at the moment, SJM and MGM and that little sort of [squired project was Louis the XIV] [ph] or something, the guy with the red Rolls Royce's building on Colovon [ph], so the little boutique place. That's it. The new tower, the rooms that were added at City of Dreams is coming into the season. And then that's it, the door sort of closes on more supply. And then we are just left with the enormous demand of China. And that's sort of coming into play now again. And I think you can see it continue. That's my opinion. Joseph Greff Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick follow-up to Joe's last one, just how do you think about the ultimate size of the demand from VIP longer term? And as you referenced VIP returning, how much of the recent strength has come from existing players versus new players? And are you seeing any changes in that customer base based on either sourced industries or geographies at the two properties? Thanks. Stephen Wynn What do you say, Ian, Ciaran, what do you say? Ciaran Carruthers We're seeing - we are very cautiously optimistic in terms of how the business in the VIP side is going on moving forward. We've obviously seen some good growth over the last quarter, quarter-and-a-half. Initial, early signs are out that that's going to be sustainable in the short period. For how long that can be sustained really is too early to tell. I'd like to see another quarter or two of some good solid growth. The upside of course is that with properties like ours we obviously benefit the most in the marketplace being that preeminent product for service and luxury. So as that new liquidity enters into the marketplace the premium master rates in junkets, we benefit more so them anybody else. So cautiously optimistic, but I think a little bit too early to call as a long-term sustainable story... Stephen Wynn Do you see, Ciaran, do you see - he asked an interesting question. I think the same old people come back, or they're new ones that you're seeing? Ciaran Carruthers We are seeing some new ones, but we are seeing a lot of the old players come back to us as well. We are seeing some old faces that are coming back into the marketplace. We've seeing some junkets that have been fairly stays over the last 18 months, 24 months, start to rebuild. We recently had a junket at Wynn Macau during this quarter. Stephen Wynn And another one is coming up this week? Ciaran Carruthers That's right. At Wynn Macau, this junket went from two tables to ten tables. About six weeks ago, when they have been very solid through that period, they continued to show good strength. So again, early indications are positive, but cautiously optimistic looking forward. Stephen Grambling That's very helpful. And maybe if you turn back to Las Vegas, Steve, can you just talk about any impact you're expecting from the Raiders move there and how that may or may not play into what you ultimately pursue at Paradise Park? Stephen Wynn Love the Raiders coming. And I even spoke before the joint session of the senate and the assembly in Carson City, along with Jim Murren and the folks from Harris were there. We are very, very happy. This was whipped cream and cherry on the cake, I mean, getting professional sports into Las Vegas is a perfect thing. I spent Easter on vacation at the Bahamas. And one of my guests with me was Dan Snyder that owns the Redskins. And while, I was there at Baker's Bay, Robert Kraft was onboard, and so is Steve Bisciotti that owns the Ravens. And we were all talking about how certain the owners were - we had 31 out of 32 votes to move the team here, how certain everybody is that NFL games in Las Vegas are going to light it up. Super Bowl without the game actually here is as big as New Year practically in this town. Now, when we have these home games or exhibition games in the city, and we will have a stadium big enough for Super Bowl, and the Super Bowl will be here, more than once, this place will go bonkers. And speaking for our own hotel, we figure to get a big share at the top end of that business. So we believe that it's a tremendous impact of the football team to the strip first of all regardless of where the stadium is built. And I think that I know where it's going to be built. Mark has an auction on piece of property just on the other side of I-15, just opposite Mandalay Bay actually of Russell Road is a site that he is auctioned. That may or may not be the final location for this big installation. But I suspect we are going to have football here in 2020. And I can't wait for it to happen. What it's impact will be on my development of the golf course is another story. We are building the golf course to power up our existing assets and to allow us to expand in non-casino ways, the power of Las Vegas. I want to repeat once again that a casino is a passive place, every slot machine and roulette table in the world is identical to every other. What drives people, what moves people are the non-casino directions. And that's why in spite of the fact that we've had the most financially successful casino in the world other than Singapore and Macau, right up until today, never in my company's history and that includes Mirage Resorts, Palazzo, Mirage all the rest of them, Atlantic City, Biloxi or downtown Las Vegas, the casino revenue has never been equal to 50% of the revenue it's always been less. And lately, it's almost two to one. So what moves people are the adventures of a vacation, great service and choice of activities. The development of golf course is a direct aim at that mentality. And the football team is just like adding into a symphonic orchestra the strings and percussion. So we got T-Mobile Arena that MGM and Phil Anschutz built, AEG. My guess is we'll end up with an NBA team before this is over. We've got a hockey team. You fast-forward 36 months or so, and Las Vegas is I believe will be a sports capital how about that. Stephen Grambling That's all great. Stephen Wynn Now, with 160,000 rooms where is it better than here for that sort of thing. And everybody wants to come here anyway from every city and other countries. And we'll use that football stadium for soccer before it's over or my name isn't Steve. So I think that recent developments portend very positively for Las Vegas. Stephen Grambling Great, thanks. I'm looking forward to going bonkers of the game too. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix Hi, thanks for taking my question. Ian and Ciaran, this will probably get directed to you. So just wanted to first compliment you on the great performance in Macau in the quarter, and on the VIP site both properties beat us nicely. But on the mass, depending on the property they're either in line or slightly below our expectation. So I'm wondering now that you have the VIP piece of the puzzle in place. What's the plan to drive mass growth and I know for you guys it's primarily premium mass. And then, how would you describe that piece in the quarter relative to your expectations? Ian Coughlan This is Ian. So looking at the premium mass portion at Wynn Macau it was really post opening of Wynn Palace about maintaining service levels and keeping the stickiness of the customers that we had downtown. And we've been very successful and doing that. And over at the Palace it was about continuing that slow steady build of premium mass players from a quite distinct market. And I have to say on both accounts it's being successful. The ramp-up period of Wynn Palace is not as quick as we'd like it to be. But it's been very steady. There is momentum. And on the premium mass side we continue to build new players for Wynn Palace. And as each weekend and each holiday period goes by, we pick up more people. We've done a lot of internal building of key host for the marketplace. And we are out there hunting for players and making them happy and keeping them. Felicia Hendrix And how are you seeing the promotional side of the business in that segment? Ian Coughlan As referred to on previous calls, Cotai is more heavily promotionally driven. And we are in that game and we are competing with everybody else. We are not doing anything untoward. We are not changing the dynamics of the market. We are just competing fairly, and we've got the nicest probably in Cotai. Similarly, downtown we still command the Peninsula, so we're delivering on our promise both properties are in great condition, and the player council building. Stephen Wynn Can I add something to this. If those of you on the call have been there, if you can visualize the physical layout, our benefit downtown has been at the Wynn Macau that we were in a cross flow of the people from the surrounding casinos both SJM's place, the Arc, MGM, and one on the corner Star World. In Macau, we were on opening day in August at the end - the east end of Macau - of the Cotai. When we get through with next six to 10 months, we are in the middle of SJM, MGM, and surrounded by the light rail, the monorail. So now, we get this brand new center of energy called Cotai East, for lack of a better term. That has a tremendous impact on our walk-in mass business. Not only do we not enjoy this at the moment, but we are blocked on our west side by barricades, and construction as I mentioned so many times before. But understand, that when it finishes we are in the middle again. And that's why the Peninsula hotel has always had such a terrific mass business, because they walk across the street and boom. I mean, when SJM opens their 2,400 rooms, we are literally across the street from them, and across the street from MGM, and across the street from the new tower at City of Dreams. And all of that connectivity comes to bear as we move forward in the quarters ahead. Lot of things that mature, that we thought they would be done by the time we were done. I literally thought we are going to be last at one point. And of course it turns out we were first not only with the transportation, but the existing hotels in our neighborhood. So it's been a challenge to deal with that handicap. But that comes to an end here, pretty soon. And then it swings the other way rather dramatically, and we've got extra real estate to build more rooms. And we will add to our room total, because we know that we can fill them at a good rate. Felicia Hendrix So that's helpful. So it's sounds like to taking everything together what you offset maybe to assume some sequential growth just from some of the programs you're doing, but really the real growth in the premium side will come in all the construction has gone? Ian Coughlan Right. That's what we believe. Felicia Hendrix Okay. Ian Coughlan You just summarized management and Board's conviction on this matter. Felicia Hendrix Great. That's helpful. And Steve, your comments earlier on the growth of the market particularly on the VIP side are very helpful. I think a lot of people are also a little cautious about is, in the past Wynn growth came in - when GGR grew too fast or perceptively too fast. We would see the government either steadily or not so steadily make different policy changes to run in growth. Do you think there is a risk of government interference at this time? Or do you think this is a new normal given the new supply that needs to be absorbed? Stephen Wynn We don't based upon our conversations with the government and our perception of things they've said to other people. We do not see any negative impact by central government or Macau government activity matter of fact we see quite the opposite support and encouragement. Felicia Hendrix Great, super. Helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen Hi, so just on the Wynn Macau, the Peninsula property. You are able to improve your market share by over 1% versus the fourth quarter. I heard your comments to the last question around the strength in VIP and the stickiness of your customers there. But is there anything else you're doing differently to support that improvement in market share? Thank you. Stephen Wynn Yes, we hired Ciaran Carruthers. Ciaran Carruthers Next question. Stephen Wynn At the end of the day, it's about people, isn't it? And we are constantly strengthening the human resource side of this company, and under Ian's leadership, we've done so on number of levels. Now the way it works over there. If somebody that we admire and is willing to come to work for us, and we can't do a meeting of mind. And if they are in the market they have to give notice, and then they have this sit-out, cool-off period that's imposed by the laws of Macau. So some of these people that are coming to us, have had - their arrival has been stunted by the law. On June 1, we get another tranche of some of our new recruits and they are in training outside of Macau to join our company, and to pick up on our culture. But have a steady program of muscling up, marketing, food and beverage, casino and hotels. One of the men that's coming to us is a five star executive, he starts on June 1. Tony is coming from the Bangkok hotel, where he got the five star, he is joining us. Our new food and beverage, Vice President is finishing his cooling off period as well as several other people. And I'm not quite sure how public I should get while they're in the cooling off period. But I will tell you that come June 1, we power up even more our executive leadership of the company. Craig Billings Steve, there was one of the gift we gave Ciaran when he joined us in January. We added some tables to Wynn Macau. We had it over-steered a bit in terms of table movement. And now we've calibrated both properties for optimum efficiency and that's certainly help the quarter at Wynn Macau in the mass side. Stephen Wynn And as you can see everybody, this old business of the amount of tables was overrated. It's a thing, I said in August, and you can see that it's not up the amount of tables, it's who's at them the matters, and how long they stay that's the game we are in, not the gross amount of tables. We've never been the biggest at anything, we've always been the one that captures the quality end of the market, and those are the kind of buildings, we build and those are the kind of people we hire. That are join together, because of a common desire to be part of high quality operation. Ciaran Carruthers Into that point, if I can add, across all of our business segments through the first quarter, we had our average daily volumes exceeded the period and it may lead up to Wynn Palace Ultimum [ph]. So we've been able to regain - not only regain the business that we may have lost through Palace Ultimum, we've grown on that as well as the market is lifted. Thomas Allen Congratulations, definitely seeing in the numbers. Just moving onto Vegas. Revenue was up 6% in the quarter, EBITDA obviously up 23%. How does that market feel obviously there are one time things or it's supporting the first quarter in the market in general. But is that market feel like it's starting to improve and maybe it's specifically around high-end Asian player would be helpful? Thank you. Stephen Wynn Mr. Wooden is here. Maurice Wooden So again, I think the first quarter was a perfect balance of all areas. You look at our gaming, hotel, food and beverage, so we were perfect position where all those areas actually performed much better than they did last year. Looking forward our convention pace is outperforming outpacing any future historical metrics that we use. And so we are on a really strong pace of 2018 and 2019 for convention bookings as well. So here Las Vegas, we are optimistic that we'll continue to look at REVPAR growth, somewhere in the 45% for the year. And looking into the future with respect to the kind of convention business that's really important to us, we see tremendous growth there as well. Stephen Wynn We will be constantly adding and developing a convention of the market, especially the part where the money is, which is the catering and meeting room and banquet business as opposed to the exhibit space itself. For that we're right across the street in the sands. We're right across the street from the Las Vegas Convention Bureau, both of these entities are aggressive, and we are in the crossfire, so we love it. And we are feeling good about our Asian business as things improved in China, we've always been the principal beneficiary of Asian baccarat relentlessness in Las Vegas. Even before we open the Mirage and the best Chinese business, then Bellagio at the best part for our business, and then when and on core at the best baccarat business. And we feel almost just quickly as they're doing Macau, we feel that here in Las Vegas. Up until including last night and this morning, where baccarat numbers, and given shift are $2 million stuff like that. This place gives that business every week, and it's pretty cool, and also we enjoyed that. You may ask yourself, why would Asian people, with so many casinos in their home territory fly 15 hours to Las Vegas, and stay at a place like Bellagio or the The Venetian. It's because of the choices you have here, it's because of the non-casino venue that gets back to football team to basketball, hockey and conventions and shopping, restaurants. This place, this town is a real safe bet. We ask our [Technical Difficulty], we say is anybody on the Board of Directors believe that Las Vegas would not in the next 15 to 20 years be one of the major destination tour cities in the world. And no one has ever answered to that question. And that's what we feel so good about our real estate and our opportunities here. And then we are going to open this place in Boston in two dozen months. And we are going to have a case study of how grand hotel in the major metropolitan city can change the neighborhood for the better. And be the largest private investment in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the second largest employer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts behind Mass General Hospital. So I like the direction we are in, and I'm feeling comfortable about the pace of our growth. And I don't feel like anybody is after us. We're moving along exactly the way we should be. And my colleagues joined me in that conference. Thomas Allen Helpful. Thank you. Stephen Wynn You're welcome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Margaret Farley Great, thanks. One Macau question and one question about the U.S. operations. The Macau question is kind of similar to other folks has been asking about that when you look at the greater number of rooms that you have on Cotai versus Peninsula. When do you think that the mass drop there, we'll get to exceed what you have on the Peninsula? Stephen Wynn Good question, Robin. I'm not the guy could answer that. I know that Linda is on an airplane, because she was here with me last night. She is on her way - Linda Chen, back to Macau. Ian and Ciaran, can you deal with Robin's question? Ian Coughlan We've got 700 more keys at Wynn Palace, and the waiting of casino rooms versus cash rooms is a lot lower than it is on the Peninsula. Downtown on the Peninsula it's been virtually impossible for 10 years to get a room in Wynn Macau, because it's been so heavily casino driven. Cotai is a slightly different market, but we have lots of room to grow casino customers and continue to hold high occupancy at Wynn Palace. We've lifted occupancy at Wynn Palace from the low-70s in the third quarter to mid-90s in the first quarter of 2017. And there is quite a lot of activity in tour and travelling cash business, but we have lots of rooms with casino market. So as we gain momentum and continue to ramp up those rooms, we'll got to mid-tier and premium mass customers. Ciaran Carruthers And when that happens, as soon as we straighten out the concession business, we'll add several thousand rooms to Cotai. Robin Margaret Farley Okay. Great, thanks. And then my question on the U.S. operations, if you look at your budget for Boston, kind of two quarters ago you were talking about kind of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And then it sort of moved to the $2.2 billion range and now $2.4 billion. So when you look at that… Ian Coughlan That's the end of it, $2.4 billion. It's bought out, that's the number. Robin Margaret Farley And, well, so that… Ian Coughlan With a big contingency. Robin Margaret Farley And that was one question; it was like is that final now. But then also, I think originally when you were talking about the project in Vegas, you were talking about a $1 billion budget. Is it sort of just a coincidence that the Boston budget - that the Vegas budget has gone done by the amount that Boston budget has gone up? Is there anything to be read into that? Stephen Wynn No, it is a coincidence. I tried very hard to explain why we're handling the lagoon and the golf course the way we are. And it was function of the EBITDA certainty of phase one. And the fact that we have so many options about what to do with the rest of the real estate on the waterfront that we want to see it first. So - and the fact that that budget went down is a coincidence entirely. The fact that the budget went up in Massachusetts is a function of the surprisingly expensive bids we got from the subs. I did change scope about eight months ago, wasn't it, Matt? Matt Maddox Yes. Stephen Wynn When we added more convention space. I added more convention space on our property. But it really - the GMP is at $1.310 billion. And we were surprised for a couple of hundred million, 150 to 200, Matt? Matt Maddox Yes. Stephen Wynn And we took a lot of bids. And we went back and value-engineered, because we didn't like the bids and we cleaned it up some more. But, boy, I'll tell you, building in Boston is expensive. The subs have a lot of work. They - we were cross-bidding four and five different outfits on things like HVAC, electrical and plumbing. And those numbers stood. And it's not just that it's a union town, because we've always built union buildings out here. It's the building trades are busy in Boston and the cost of living is high in Boston. Now, that's a gate that swings both ways. The cost of living is high in Boston, so wager levels are higher in Boston, but so is the average income in that magnificent metropolitan area. It's matter of fact, the average income in the metropolitan area, the four-point-eight-or-nine million people that we are going to serve by ourselves so to speak is one of the highest per cap metropolitan areas in the United States, if not, the highest. Is it the highest, Matt? Matt Maddox I don't know. It's one of the highest. Stephen Wynn Yes, I mean, we've never been in a city where the per cap income is as high as this, not to mention non-stop air service from every single capital in the world to Logan Airport, including Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, Geneva, London, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, Seoul, non-stop service to Boston on a daily basis. And we've never been in a city where we're 12 minutes away, where our hotel is 12 minutes away from an international airport with non-stop service from every capital on earth, the first time for us. We've always had to go get the folks in LA and fly them over here in one of our jets, but not this time. We're 12 minutes from Logan Airport. I was there last week. And that's how long it took me to get there. And we're 12 minutes from Boston Garden. We're in Everett, which is its own city, with its own Mayor, a wonderful fellow and a wonderful city council. But we are surrounded like an island by Boston and its suburbs. And on the edge of our property, if you take three steps to the right you're in Boston. You take three steps to the left you're in Everett. And that's on three sites. So we're an island in that metropolitan area, and happy to be there. So it was coincidence. It was a coincidence. Robin Margaret Farley Okay. Thanks for the color. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line Harry Curtis with Instinet. Daniel Scott Adam Hi, this is Dan Adam for Harry Curtis. Thanks for taking our question. In Macau, looking at demand trend so far in April, we are wondering if you're seeing a continuation of the strong 18% market growth that we saw in February and March follow through into April. Thanks. Stephen Wynn Well, I don't know that we want to get into the next quarter. Ian Coughlan No, I don't think so. We're usually - it's too early right now to be talking about the second quarter. Stephen Wynn Yes, I think - I don't think that - I don't want to give people false expectations or anything like that, so I think we'll be off that little concern. But it was throughout. Daniel Scott Adam Yes, fine. Thank you. Stephen Wynn Dan, is there another question? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Adam Trivison with Gabelli & Company. Adam Trivison Hi, thanks for taking my question. Steve, can you give us your thoughts on the opportunity in Japan and how you're approaching it in the context of your other investment opportunities? Stephen Wynn Could you repeat the question please? Adam Trivison Could you talk about the opportunity in Japan and how you're approaching it in the context of all your investment opportunities? Stephen Wynn Matthew Maddox can handle that and I'll take all the… Matt Maddox Sure. So we've been monitoring Japan for the last decade pretty carefully. And for us right now this is actually a really exciting time. It seems like all the right people and corporations are now focused on moving the IR implementation go forward in the next 12 months. And the Wynn focus on quality, and what we do we think fits quite well with what Japan is looking for. So we are ramping up our efforts and really excited about the opportunity. Adam Trivison Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, the second one, Maurice, you touched on this a little bit. But in Las Vegas REVPAR was very strong, first quarter. Can you talk a little about the way that played out over the quarter, I guess, particularly with a lot of it in March or what's the pace in there? Maurice Wooden Well, really, January and March. So we got out of the gate very strong with CES and then there was from a convention and transient segment. The entire quarter had a lot of strength. Obviously, in March, we didn't deal with the Easter holiday and the Passover holiday that occurred in 2016 in March. This year it's in April, so there was a shifting of that holiday period. And then we had one unique group that comes every three years, CON/AGG, CONEXPO in March, and then also helped the [city with city-wide event] [ph], a great group to have. And so, but really the strength is both transient and convention, so really then translates into cash revenue. Adam Trivison Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley Hi, good afternoon. Maybe I just wanted to go back to the ramp up at Cotai. And I guess it's probably a little bit difficult to analyze, given that January and February were so impacted by Chinese New Year. But when you kind of look back at the quarter, did you see, I guess, some continued sequential ramp up, at least across the quarter in some of the key metrics or KPIs that you guys are watching at the property? Ian Coughlan Yes, business has been growing in all segments, non-gaming and gaming. It hasn't been outstanding in one particular area. Shaun Kelley Okay. Thanks for that, Ian. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up is - we talked a little bit about the promotional environment in the mass and premium mass segments, which appears still competitive in Cotai. But could you talk a little bit about the VIP business, either what you're seeing from junkets right now, some of the interest in either extending credit from your standpoint, adding rooms, things like that, because it doesn't feel like many other people in the market right now are actually targeting this business from a competitive standpoint? Ian Coughlan With the type of product that we provide and service in the marketplace lends itself to being very attractive to junkets. An interesting stat is that, when Macau and Wynn Palace combine junket volume was 2.5 times our junket volume for the 60 days prior to the opening of Wynn Palace. So we are very attractive to junket operators. There are types of players. Our direct program continues to grow between the two properties. And in addition to being a great place for mass players, Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau lead in terms of VIP service and quality. Shaun Kelley Thanks. And maybe just a last one, Ian, are you seeing I guess new junkets or new sub-junkets like some of the signs of I guess early credit formation? Are we kind of at that part in the cycle there? Ian Coughlan So we certainly - we've seen junkets that have been quieter, rebuild a lot of their business. Ciaran referred to one junket that's grown from two tables to ten. We also - that's downtown Macau. At Wynn Palace, we have a new very strong junket starting in a couple of days. So there's continued interest from existing junkets and want to grow their business. Matt Maddox Shaun, it's Matt. One thing I think you'll appreciate is we're generating about $8.5 million of VIP revenue a day between the two properties, which is similar to the 2014, 2015 levels with less than half of the advances. So this is not a credit driven liquidity revenue like we've seen in the past. It feels very healthy. Shaun Kelley That's great, Matt. And then, maybe if I could, just one more on that would be, you sense a similar type of environment for the junkets themselves? Are they extending as much credit or are the customers more flush with cash as well? Stephen Wynn It's a tough question to answer, but it's an interesting question. Shaun Kelley Yes, I guess, maybe you could see it little bit in the collections, right? In the past it's been as short as 15 days, sometimes that period lengthens out a little bit, probably the only way to give any sense really. Matt Maddox You know what I would say is, when you talk to the junket operators they'll tell you their liquidity is much better. And what that means is they're collecting more of their debts than they were in the past on top of raising additional funds. So they're not getting the liquidity from the operators. They're getting it from better collections and from outside investors. So I think that's a good indication that the health of the junket market is much better than it was. Stephen Wynn It's such a good question. I'm going to ask some of the junket of that, [I didn't thought to ask them] [ph]. Shaun Kelley Great. Stephen Wynn [indiscernible]. We're not given… Craig Billings There is a general sentiment in the market at among the junket operators that they are managing to collect on debt that's owed to them and they're able to put it back into the market. Shaun Kelley Perfect. Thank you very much, everyone. Operator And there are no additional questions at this time. Stephen Wynn Well, thank you very much everybody. Talk to you again in 90 days or so. Appreciate your interest. Have a nice week. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. And your first question comes from the line of Carlo Santarelli with Deutsche Bank. Carlo Santarelli Hey, thanks. And thank you for the explanation on Paradise Park. And as you think about the master-plan longer term, I know when you guys originally kind of proposed the idea back in April at the Analyst Day, a hotel and kind of broader scope was attributed to it. Could we kind of look at it today and say, okay, Cotai is up and running, Macau is doing a little bit better, but - and you guys are being a little bit more conservative with this spend, going forward with the elements of the project that you think have high-return associated with them in the near-term and then could potentially branch into something larger with potential additional hotel towers more similar to the original contemplation down the road? Stephen Wynn I couldn't have said it better myself, Carlo. Carlo Santarelli Okay. Okay. That's easy then. And then on… Stephen Wynn Would you, if I may? Carlo Santarelli Yes. Stephen Wynn This idea, if you build it they'll come, has been something that I've done for the past 40 odd years. But I've never had an opportunity that was so rich in options in my entire career in Las Vegas. This golf course and this lagoon and the beach-run property, every time we turn around someone else comes to see us to do something else with it or to buy a piece or to rent a piece or to do a JV. And it's been very exciting. So I say, well, before I build my idea of a thing to go on that section, let's put it out there, let's feel it, let's live with it for a while, let's give everybody a chance to appreciate how dynamic this location is and how powerful the opportunity is. Maybe we miss something. Every once in a while, when you're a wide-eyed developer like myself, and my colleagues, it's good to take a beat and so we did. Carlo Santarelli Understood, and then if - maybe somebody could help out here. Obviously, you guys had some favorables on the VIP hold side, maybe a little bit of light mass hold that looked like at Peninsula. But when you look at each of the three assets, could you guys kind of give us what your sense was for normalized property level, EBITDA metrics? Stephen Wynn Nothing in China and a few million bucks in Vegas. Carlo Santarelli Okay. Craig Billings All right, the direct hold was low and the junket hold was high. So when you look at it, there really was no hold impact on the Peninsula. Carlo Santarelli Okay. And now, that was - so the three-three you were saying on the junket side is the junket side plays favorable, the direct side played weak and kind of mitigate it. Craig Billings That's right. Carlo Santarelli Okay. Okay, great. Thank you, guys. Stephen Wynn Sure. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Joe Greff with J.P. Morgan. Joseph Greff Good afternoon, everybody. Just so we maybe can get a sense of how to think about normalized margins on the Peninsula. I know there was a collection benefit and you had them from time-to-time and I understand how you reserved for outstanding credit. But can you talk about what that impact may have been at Peninsula in the 1Q, just so we get a sense of how to think about normalized property level EBITDA margin? Craig Billings Hey, Joe, it was about $5.5 million. Joseph Greff Got that. Great. And is it your sense that the rate of outstanding credits being paid off and [that is that's] [ph] benefiting for you and others on the VIP side at Macau, is that starting to plateau or is there - do you feel that sustainable? Stephen Wynn You can answer that question. Ian Coughlan This is Ian in Macau. We've had some favorable collection of credit. And it certainly seems to be tied in with the stronger credit market in general and it has benefited for us for a number of quarters. Joseph Greff Okay. And maybe just a big picture for you, Steve, you referenced obviously a resurgence in the high-end, the top-end in China. It surely manifested in the numbers you reported tonight. What do you think as driving that? And how sustainable are those drivers from here? I don't know if anybody has the right answer for that, but if you can share with us your view. Stephen Wynn I have a picture - I have an opinion on that. And of course, it's just my opinion. But I've said in these calls in the past that it would be a mistake to misunderstand the primary underlying driver of the Chinese economy. It is a massive thing and when you say that as I have in the past that we have a very positive and bullish look forward into our long-term position in Macau, at some point the long-term vision and the short-term begin to meld as they are now. The suppression of the VIP market was something that was the result organically of a process that the administration of President Xi Jinping thought was appropriate for the country, the elimination of corruption. And it had secondary effects on high-end products like shopping, and automobiles, and gaming was part of that. But having made a corrective move in China there comes a point when the corrective move, it sort of finishes. And although corruption is still a major item in the PRC, the initial impact has softened, because so much of the work that they thought had to be done, was done. And so people begin to return to normal spending habits, and they are not so strongly influenced by public policy issues that involve public officials. So the people are settling back into routines that they're comfortable with, and that includes going to Macau and buying a new car or shopping at Louis Vuitton. And we've always been part of that cycle, and it wasn't going to be permanent, and we've said that before. Long-term strength of the Chinese concession is one of the most precious assets in modern day. And we are just been seeing it. And another thing, they limited the expansion of Macau in a number of ways. First, by the real estate that is available. The last hotels to be built are being built at the moment, SJM and MGM and that little sort of [squired project was Louis the XIV] [ph] or something, the guy with the red Rolls Royce's building on Colovon [ph], so the little boutique place. That's it. The new tower, the rooms that were added at City of Dreams is coming into the season. And then that's it, the door sort of closes on more supply. And then we are just left with the enormous demand of China. And that's sort of coming into play now again. And I think you can see it continue. That's my opinion. Joseph Greff Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling Hey, thanks for taking the question. Maybe a quick follow-up to Joe's last one, just how do you think about the ultimate size of the demand from VIP longer term? And as you referenced VIP returning, how much of the recent strength has come from existing players versus new players? And are you seeing any changes in that customer base based on either sourced industries or geographies at the two properties? Thanks. Stephen Wynn What do you say, Ian, Ciaran, what do you say? Ciaran Carruthers We're seeing - we are very cautiously optimistic in terms of how the business in the VIP side is going on moving forward. We've obviously seen some good growth over the last quarter, quarter-and-a-half. Initial, early signs are out that that's going to be sustainable in the short period. For how long that can be sustained really is too early to tell. I'd like to see another quarter or two of some good solid growth. The upside of course is that with properties like ours we obviously benefit the most in the marketplace being that preeminent product for service and luxury. So as that new liquidity enters into the marketplace the premium master rates in junkets, we benefit more so them anybody else. So cautiously optimistic, but I think a little bit too early to call as a long-term sustainable story... Stephen Wynn Do you see, Ciaran, do you see - he asked an interesting question. I think the same old people come back, or they're new ones that you're seeing? Ciaran Carruthers We are seeing some new ones, but we are seeing a lot of the old players come back to us as well. We are seeing some old faces that are coming back into the marketplace. We've seeing some junkets that have been fairly stays over the last 18 months, 24 months, start to rebuild. We recently had a junket at Wynn Macau during this quarter. Stephen Wynn And another one is coming up this week? Ciaran Carruthers That's right. At Wynn Macau, this junket went from two tables to ten tables. About six weeks ago, when they have been very solid through that period, they continued to show good strength. So again, early indications are positive, but cautiously optimistic looking forward. Stephen Grambling That's very helpful. And maybe if you turn back to Las Vegas, Steve, can you just talk about any impact you're expecting from the Raiders move there and how that may or may not play into what you ultimately pursue at Paradise Park? Stephen Wynn Love the Raiders coming. And I even spoke before the joint session of the senate and the assembly in Carson City, along with Jim Murren and the folks from Harris were there. We are very, very happy. This was whipped cream and cherry on the cake, I mean, getting professional sports into Las Vegas is a perfect thing. I spent Easter on vacation at the Bahamas. And one of my guests with me was Dan Snyder that owns the Redskins. And while, I was there at Baker's Bay, Robert Kraft was onboard, and so is Steve Bisciotti that owns the Ravens. And we were all talking about how certain the owners were - we had 31 out of 32 votes to move the team here, how certain everybody is that NFL games in Las Vegas are going to light it up. Super Bowl without the game actually here is as big as New Year practically in this town. Now, when we have these home games or exhibition games in the city, and we will have a stadium big enough for Super Bowl, and the Super Bowl will be here, more than once, this place will go bonkers. And speaking for our own hotel, we figure to get a big share at the top end of that business. So we believe that it's a tremendous impact of the football team to the strip first of all regardless of where the stadium is built. And I think that I know where it's going to be built. Mark has an auction on piece of property just on the other side of I-15, just opposite Mandalay Bay actually of Russell Road is a site that he is auctioned. That may or may not be the final location for this big installation. But I suspect we are going to have football here in 2020. And I can't wait for it to happen. What it's impact will be on my development of the golf course is another story. We are building the golf course to power up our existing assets and to allow us to expand in non-casino ways, the power of Las Vegas. I want to repeat once again that a casino is a passive place, every slot machine and roulette table in the world is identical to every other. What drives people, what moves people are the non-casino directions. And that's why in spite of the fact that we've had the most financially successful casino in the world other than Singapore and Macau, right up until today, never in my company's history and that includes Mirage Resorts, Palazzo, Mirage all the rest of them, Atlantic City, Biloxi or downtown Las Vegas, the casino revenue has never been equal to 50% of the revenue it's always been less. And lately, it's almost two to one. So what moves people are the adventures of a vacation, great service and choice of activities. The development of golf course is a direct aim at that mentality. And the football team is just like adding into a symphonic orchestra the strings and percussion. So we got T-Mobile Arena that MGM and Phil Anschutz built, AEG. My guess is we'll end up with an NBA team before this is over. We've got a hockey team. You fast-forward 36 months or so, and Las Vegas is I believe will be a sports capital how about that. Stephen Grambling That's all great. Stephen Wynn Now, with 160,000 rooms where is it better than here for that sort of thing. And everybody wants to come here anyway from every city and other countries. And we'll use that football stadium for soccer before it's over or my name isn't Steve. So I think that recent developments portend very positively for Las Vegas. Stephen Grambling Great, thanks. I'm looking forward to going bonkers of the game too. I'll jump back in the queue. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Felicia Hendrix with Barclays. Felicia Hendrix Hi, thanks for taking my question. Ian and Ciaran, this will probably get directed to you. So just wanted to first compliment you on the great performance in Macau in the quarter, and on the VIP site both properties beat us nicely. But on the mass, depending on the property they're either in line or slightly below our expectation. So I'm wondering now that you have the VIP piece of the puzzle in place. What's the plan to drive mass growth and I know for you guys it's primarily premium mass. And then, how would you describe that piece in the quarter relative to your expectations? Ian Coughlan This is Ian. So looking at the premium mass portion at Wynn Macau it was really post opening of Wynn Palace about maintaining service levels and keeping the stickiness of the customers that we had downtown. And we've been very successful and doing that. And over at the Palace it was about continuing that slow steady build of premium mass players from a quite distinct market. And I have to say on both accounts it's being successful. The ramp-up period of Wynn Palace is not as quick as we'd like it to be. But it's been very steady. There is momentum. And on the premium mass side we continue to build new players for Wynn Palace. And as each weekend and each holiday period goes by, we pick up more people. We've done a lot of internal building of key host for the marketplace. And we are out there hunting for players and making them happy and keeping them. Felicia Hendrix And how are you seeing the promotional side of the business in that segment? Ian Coughlan As referred to on previous calls, Cotai is more heavily promotionally driven. And we are in that game and we are competing with everybody else. We are not doing anything untoward. We are not changing the dynamics of the market. We are just competing fairly, and we've got the nicest probably in Cotai. Similarly, downtown we still command the Peninsula, so we're delivering on our promise both properties are in great condition, and the player council building. Stephen Wynn Can I add something to this. If those of you on the call have been there, if you can visualize the physical layout, our benefit downtown has been at the Wynn Macau that we were in a cross flow of the people from the surrounding casinos both SJM's place, the Arc, MGM, and one on the corner Star World. In Macau, we were on opening day in August at the end - the east end of Macau - of the Cotai. When we get through with next six to 10 months, we are in the middle of SJM, MGM, and surrounded by the light rail, the monorail. So now, we get this brand new center of energy called Cotai East, for lack of a better term. That has a tremendous impact on our walk-in mass business. Not only do we not enjoy this at the moment, but we are blocked on our west side by barricades, and construction as I mentioned so many times before. But understand, that when it finishes we are in the middle again. And that's why the Peninsula hotel has always had such a terrific mass business, because they walk across the street and boom. I mean, when SJM opens their 2,400 rooms, we are literally across the street from them, and across the street from MGM, and across the street from the new tower at City of Dreams. And all of that connectivity comes to bear as we move forward in the quarters ahead. Lot of things that mature, that we thought they would be done by the time we were done. I literally thought we are going to be last at one point. And of course it turns out we were first not only with the transportation, but the existing hotels in our neighborhood. So it's been a challenge to deal with that handicap. But that comes to an end here, pretty soon. And then it swings the other way rather dramatically, and we've got extra real estate to build more rooms. And we will add to our room total, because we know that we can fill them at a good rate. Felicia Hendrix So that's helpful. So it's sounds like to taking everything together what you offset maybe to assume some sequential growth just from some of the programs you're doing, but really the real growth in the premium side will come in all the construction has gone? Ian Coughlan Right. That's what we believe. Felicia Hendrix Okay. Ian Coughlan You just summarized management and Board's conviction on this matter. Felicia Hendrix Great. That's helpful. And Steve, your comments earlier on the growth of the market particularly on the VIP side are very helpful. I think a lot of people are also a little cautious about is, in the past Wynn growth came in - when GGR grew too fast or perceptively too fast. We would see the government either steadily or not so steadily make different policy changes to run in growth. Do you think there is a risk of government interference at this time? Or do you think this is a new normal given the new supply that needs to be absorbed? Stephen Wynn We don't based upon our conversations with the government and our perception of things they've said to other people. We do not see any negative impact by central government or Macau government activity matter of fact we see quite the opposite support and encouragement. Felicia Hendrix Great, super. Helpful. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Allen with Morgan Stanley. Thomas Allen Hi, so just on the Wynn Macau, the Peninsula property. You are able to improve your market share by over 1% versus the fourth quarter. I heard your comments to the last question around the strength in VIP and the stickiness of your customers there. But is there anything else you're doing differently to support that improvement in market share? Thank you. Stephen Wynn Yes, we hired Ciaran Carruthers. Ciaran Carruthers Next question. Stephen Wynn At the end of the day, it's about people, isn't it? And we are constantly strengthening the human resource side of this company, and under Ian's leadership, we've done so on number of levels. Now the way it works over there. If somebody that we admire and is willing to come to work for us, and we can't do a meeting of mind. And if they are in the market they have to give notice, and then they have this sit-out, cool-off period that's imposed by the laws of Macau. So some of these people that are coming to us, have had - their arrival has been stunted by the law. On June 1, we get another tranche of some of our new recruits and they are in training outside of Macau to join our company, and to pick up on our culture. But have a steady program of muscling up, marketing, food and beverage, casino and hotels. One of the men that's coming to us is a five star executive, he starts on June 1. Tony is coming from the Bangkok hotel, where he got the five star, he is joining us. Our new food and beverage, Vice President is finishing his cooling off period as well as several other people. And I'm not quite sure how public I should get while they're in the cooling off period. But I will tell you that come June 1, we power up even more our executive leadership of the company. Craig Billings Steve, there was one of the gift we gave Ciaran when he joined us in January. We added some tables to Wynn Macau. We had it over-steered a bit in terms of table movement. And now we've calibrated both properties for optimum efficiency and that's certainly help the quarter at Wynn Macau in the mass side. Stephen Wynn And as you can see everybody, this old business of the amount of tables was overrated. It's a thing, I said in August, and you can see that it's not up the amount of tables, it's who's at them the matters, and how long they stay that's the game we are in, not the gross amount of tables. We've never been the biggest at anything, we've always been the one that captures the quality end of the market, and those are the kind of buildings, we build and those are the kind of people we hire. That are join together, because of a common desire to be part of high quality operation. Ciaran Carruthers Into that point, if I can add, across all of our business segments through the first quarter, we had our average daily volumes exceeded the period and it may lead up to Wynn Palace Ultimum [ph]. So we've been able to regain - not only regain the business that we may have lost through Palace Ultimum, we've grown on that as well as the market is lifted. Thomas Allen Congratulations, definitely seeing in the numbers. Just moving onto Vegas. Revenue was up 6% in the quarter, EBITDA obviously up 23%. How does that market feel obviously there are one time things or it's supporting the first quarter in the market in general. But is that market feel like it's starting to improve and maybe it's specifically around high-end Asian player would be helpful? Thank you. Stephen Wynn Mr. Wooden is here. Maurice Wooden So again, I think the first quarter was a perfect balance of all areas. You look at our gaming, hotel, food and beverage, so we were perfect position where all those areas actually performed much better than they did last year. Looking forward our convention pace is outperforming outpacing any future historical metrics that we use. And so we are on a really strong pace of 2018 and 2019 for convention bookings as well. So here Las Vegas, we are optimistic that we'll continue to look at REVPAR growth, somewhere in the 45% for the year. And looking into the future with respect to the kind of convention business that's really important to us, we see tremendous growth there as well. Stephen Wynn We will be constantly adding and developing a convention of the market, especially the part where the money is, which is the catering and meeting room and banquet business as opposed to the exhibit space itself. For that we're right across the street in the sands. We're right across the street from the Las Vegas Convention Bureau, both of these entities are aggressive, and we are in the crossfire, so we love it. And we are feeling good about our Asian business as things improved in China, we've always been the principal beneficiary of Asian baccarat relentlessness in Las Vegas. Even before we open the Mirage and the best Chinese business, then Bellagio at the best part for our business, and then when and on core at the best baccarat business. And we feel almost just quickly as they're doing Macau, we feel that here in Las Vegas. Up until including last night and this morning, where baccarat numbers, and given shift are $2 million stuff like that. This place gives that business every week, and it's pretty cool, and also we enjoyed that. You may ask yourself, why would Asian people, with so many casinos in their home territory fly 15 hours to Las Vegas, and stay at a place like Bellagio or the The Venetian. It's because of the choices you have here, it's because of the non-casino venue that gets back to football team to basketball, hockey and conventions and shopping, restaurants. This place, this town is a real safe bet. We ask our [Technical Difficulty], we say is anybody on the Board of Directors believe that Las Vegas would not in the next 15 to 20 years be one of the major destination tour cities in the world. And no one has ever answered to that question. And that's what we feel so good about our real estate and our opportunities here. And then we are going to open this place in Boston in two dozen months. And we are going to have a case study of how grand hotel in the major metropolitan city can change the neighborhood for the better. And be the largest private investment in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the second largest employer in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts behind Mass General Hospital. So I like the direction we are in, and I'm feeling comfortable about the pace of our growth. And I don't feel like anybody is after us. We're moving along exactly the way we should be. And my colleagues joined me in that conference. Thomas Allen Helpful. Thank you. Stephen Wynn You're welcome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Robin Margaret Farley Great, thanks. One Macau question and one question about the U.S. operations. The Macau question is kind of similar to other folks has been asking about that when you look at the greater number of rooms that you have on Cotai versus Peninsula. When do you think that the mass drop there, we'll get to exceed what you have on the Peninsula? Stephen Wynn Good question, Robin. I'm not the guy could answer that. I know that Linda is on an airplane, because she was here with me last night. She is on her way - Linda Chen, back to Macau. Ian and Ciaran, can you deal with Robin's question? Ian Coughlan We've got 700 more keys at Wynn Palace, and the waiting of casino rooms versus cash rooms is a lot lower than it is on the Peninsula. Downtown on the Peninsula it's been virtually impossible for 10 years to get a room in Wynn Macau, because it's been so heavily casino driven. Cotai is a slightly different market, but we have lots of room to grow casino customers and continue to hold high occupancy at Wynn Palace. We've lifted occupancy at Wynn Palace from the low-70s in the third quarter to mid-90s in the first quarter of 2017. And there is quite a lot of activity in tour and travelling cash business, but we have lots of rooms with casino market. So as we gain momentum and continue to ramp up those rooms, we'll got to mid-tier and premium mass customers. Ciaran Carruthers And when that happens, as soon as we straighten out the concession business, we'll add several thousand rooms to Cotai. Robin Margaret Farley Okay. Great, thanks. And then my question on the U.S. operations, if you look at your budget for Boston, kind of two quarters ago you were talking about kind of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And then it sort of moved to the $2.2 billion range and now $2.4 billion. So when you look at that… Ian Coughlan That's the end of it, $2.4 billion. It's bought out, that's the number. Robin Margaret Farley And, well, so that… Ian Coughlan With a big contingency. Robin Margaret Farley And that was one question; it was like is that final now. But then also, I think originally when you were talking about the project in Vegas, you were talking about a $1 billion budget. Is it sort of just a coincidence that the Boston budget - that the Vegas budget has gone done by the amount that Boston budget has gone up? Is there anything to be read into that? Stephen Wynn No, it is a coincidence. I tried very hard to explain why we're handling the lagoon and the golf course the way we are. And it was function of the EBITDA certainty of phase one. And the fact that we have so many options about what to do with the rest of the real estate on the waterfront that we want to see it first. So - and the fact that that budget went down is a coincidence entirely. The fact that the budget went up in Massachusetts is a function of the surprisingly expensive bids we got from the subs. I did change scope about eight months ago, wasn't it, Matt? Matt Maddox Yes. Stephen Wynn When we added more convention space. I added more convention space on our property. But it really - the GMP is at $1.310 billion. And we were surprised for a couple of hundred million, 150 to 200, Matt? Matt Maddox Yes. Stephen Wynn And we took a lot of bids. And we went back and value-engineered, because we didn't like the bids and we cleaned it up some more. But, boy, I'll tell you, building in Boston is expensive. The subs have a lot of work. They - we were cross-bidding four and five different outfits on things like HVAC, electrical and plumbing. And those numbers stood. And it's not just that it's a union town, because we've always built union buildings out here. It's the building trades are busy in Boston and the cost of living is high in Boston. Now, that's a gate that swings both ways. The cost of living is high in Boston, so wager levels are higher in Boston, but so is the average income in that magnificent metropolitan area. It's matter of fact, the average income in the metropolitan area, the four-point-eight-or-nine million people that we are going to serve by ourselves so to speak is one of the highest per cap metropolitan areas in the United States, if not, the highest. Is it the highest, Matt? Matt Maddox I don't know. It's one of the highest. Stephen Wynn Yes, I mean, we've never been in a city where the per cap income is as high as this, not to mention non-stop air service from every single capital in the world to Logan Airport, including Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, Geneva, London, Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Tokyo, Seoul, non-stop service to Boston on a daily basis. And we've never been in a city where we're 12 minutes away, where our hotel is 12 minutes away from an international airport with non-stop service from every capital on earth, the first time for us. We've always had to go get the folks in LA and fly them over here in one of our jets, but not this time. We're 12 minutes from Logan Airport. I was there last week. And that's how long it took me to get there. And we're 12 minutes from Boston Garden. We're in Everett, which is its own city, with its own Mayor, a wonderful fellow and a wonderful city council. But we are surrounded like an island by Boston and its suburbs. And on the edge of our property, if you take three steps to the right you're in Boston. You take three steps to the left you're in Everett. And that's on three sites. So we're an island in that metropolitan area, and happy to be there. So it was coincidence. It was a coincidence. Robin Margaret Farley Okay. Thanks for the color. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line Harry Curtis with Instinet. Daniel Scott Adam Hi, this is Dan Adam for Harry Curtis. Thanks for taking our question. In Macau, looking at demand trend so far in April, we are wondering if you're seeing a continuation of the strong 18% market growth that we saw in February and March follow through into April. Thanks. Stephen Wynn Well, I don't know that we want to get into the next quarter. Ian Coughlan No, I don't think so. We're usually - it's too early right now to be talking about the second quarter. Stephen Wynn Yes, I think - I don't think that - I don't want to give people false expectations or anything like that, so I think we'll be off that little concern. But it was throughout. Daniel Scott Adam Yes, fine. Thank you. Stephen Wynn Dan, is there another question? Operator Your next question comes from the line of Adam Trivison with Gabelli & Company. Adam Trivison Hi, thanks for taking my question. Steve, can you give us your thoughts on the opportunity in Japan and how you're approaching it in the context of your other investment opportunities? Stephen Wynn Could you repeat the question please? Adam Trivison Could you talk about the opportunity in Japan and how you're approaching it in the context of all your investment opportunities? Stephen Wynn Matthew Maddox can handle that and I'll take all the… Matt Maddox Sure. So we've been monitoring Japan for the last decade pretty carefully. And for us right now this is actually a really exciting time. It seems like all the right people and corporations are now focused on moving the IR implementation go forward in the next 12 months. And the Wynn focus on quality, and what we do we think fits quite well with what Japan is looking for. So we are ramping up our efforts and really excited about the opportunity. Adam Trivison Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, the second one, Maurice, you touched on this a little bit. But in Las Vegas REVPAR was very strong, first quarter. Can you talk a little about the way that played out over the quarter, I guess, particularly with a lot of it in March or what's the pace in there? Maurice Wooden Well, really, January and March. So we got out of the gate very strong with CES and then there was from a convention and transient segment. The entire quarter had a lot of strength. Obviously, in March, we didn't deal with the Easter holiday and the Passover holiday that occurred in 2016 in March. This year it's in April, so there was a shifting of that holiday period. And then we had one unique group that comes every three years, CON/AGG, CONEXPO in March, and then also helped the [city with city-wide event] [ph], a great group to have. And so, but really the strength is both transient and convention, so really then translates into cash revenue. Adam Trivison Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from Shaun Kelley with Bank of America. Shaun Kelley Hi, good afternoon. Maybe I just wanted to go back to the ramp up at Cotai. And I guess it's probably a little bit difficult to analyze, given that January and February were so impacted by Chinese New Year. But when you kind of look back at the quarter, did you see, I guess, some continued sequential ramp up, at least across the quarter in some of the key metrics or KPIs that you guys are watching at the property? Ian Coughlan Yes, business has been growing in all segments, non-gaming and gaming. It hasn't been outstanding in one particular area. Shaun Kelley Okay. Thanks for that, Ian. And then, I guess, just as a follow-up is - we talked a little bit about the promotional environment in the mass and premium mass segments, which appears still competitive in Cotai. But could you talk a little bit about the VIP business, either what you're seeing from junkets right now, some of the interest in either extending credit from your standpoint, adding rooms, things like that, because it doesn't feel like many other people in the market right now are actually targeting this business from a competitive standpoint? Ian Coughlan With the type of product that we provide and service in the marketplace lends itself to being very attractive to junkets. An interesting stat is that, when Macau and Wynn Palace combine junket volume was 2.5 times our junket volume for the 60 days prior to the opening of Wynn Palace. So we are very attractive to junket operators. There are types of players. Our direct program continues to grow between the two properties. And in addition to being a great place for mass players, Wynn Palace and Wynn Macau lead in terms of VIP service and quality. Shaun Kelley Thanks. And maybe just a last one, Ian, are you seeing I guess new junkets or new sub-junkets like some of the signs of I guess early credit formation? Are we kind of at that part in the cycle there? Ian Coughlan So we certainly - we've seen junkets that have been quieter, rebuild a lot of their business. Ciaran referred to one junket that's grown from two tables to ten. We also - that's downtown Macau. At Wynn Palace, we have a new very strong junket starting in a couple of days. So there's continued interest from existing junkets and want to grow their business. Matt Maddox Shaun, it's Matt. One thing I think you'll appreciate is we're generating about $8.5 million of VIP revenue a day between the two properties, which is similar to the 2014, 2015 levels with less than half of the advances. So this is not a credit driven liquidity revenue like we've seen in the past. It feels very healthy. Shaun Kelley That's great, Matt. And then, maybe if I could, just one more on that would be, you sense a similar type of environment for the junkets themselves? Are they extending as much credit or are the customers more flush with cash as well? Stephen Wynn It's a tough question to answer, but it's an interesting question. Shaun Kelley Yes, I guess, maybe you could see it little bit in the collections, right? In the past it's been as short as 15 days, sometimes that period lengthens out a little bit, probably the only way to give any sense really. Matt Maddox You know what I would say is, when you talk to the junket operators they'll tell you their liquidity is much better. And what that means is they're collecting more of their debts than they were in the past on top of raising additional funds. So they're not getting the liquidity from the operators. They're getting it from better collections and from outside investors. So I think that's a good indication that the health of the junket market is much better than it was. Stephen Wynn It's such a good question. I'm going to ask some of the junket of that, [I didn't thought to ask them] [ph]. Shaun Kelley Great. Stephen Wynn [indiscernible]. We're not given… Craig Billings There is a general sentiment in the market at among the junket operators that they are managing to collect on debt that's owed to them and they're able to put it back into the market. Shaun Kelley Perfect. Thank you very much, everyone. Operator And there are no additional questions at this time. Stephen Wynn Well, thank you very much everybody. Talk to you again in 90 days or so. Appreciate your interest. Have a nice week. Bye. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Derek Leckow, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter 2017 conference call. I would like to remind you that an earnings slide deck presentation relating to this call is available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statement on slides two and three of our earnings slide presentation. During today's conference call, we'll make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about the future performance and financial results. We base these statements on certain assumptions and expectations of future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of our most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. And with that, I'll now turn the program over to Jeffrey Slovin, Chief Executive Officer of Dentsply Sirona. Jeff? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks, Derek. It is my pleasure to welcome all of you to our first quarter 2017 conference call. Also joining us on the call today Chris Clark, our President and Chief Operating Officer, Technologies; and Joshua Zable, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Before I begin, please note that our CFO, Uli Michel, will not be on the call today to attend to a medical issue. We look forward to his return next time. Turning to the call, our results this quarter were far from stellar, but I am pleased that we are able to deliver on critical strategic objectives. We are now better positioned to accelerate our short and long-term growth. In March, at the International Dental Show, Dentsply Sirona set the standard for what it means to be a total solutions provider for the dental professionals and labs. We unveiled how an enabling technologies integrated with procedural solutions provide better clinical outcomes. We also reinforced our position as the innovator in the industry. At the Show, we launched 50 new products which will drive our growth for years to come. This morning we also announced our plans to expand distribution in the U.S. market. We are excited to expand our partnership with Patterson, with a new long-term U.S. distribution agreement that will help drive adoption of our digital technologies and solutions for years to come. Together, over 20 years, we've created CEREC as the standard for single-visit dentistry in the U.S. We are also excited to expand our relationship with Henry Schein in North America, with a new three-year agreement beginning in September, under which Henry Schein will begin selling our leading equipment brand in the U.S. This should benefit all of our product lines, including Schick Sensors, Treatment Centers, extraoral imaging, and of course, CEREC as well. Both Patterson and Henry Schein will be critical drivers in accelerating adoption of our digital technology and our unique integrated solutions. We firmly believe our now new go-to-market strategy in the U.S. will accelerate our growth for years to come. I will discuss this in more detail later. Our merger-related initiatives are on track. We will ramp cost and revenue synergy activities throughout the year, driving top and bottom-line growth for 2017. Turning to the quarterly results. First quarter internal sales declined 4.7%, driven by decline in technology. Consumables and Healthcare grew 2.4% this quarter. Our Consumables business grew in each of our three regions. Technologies declined by approximately 13% or $57 million. Growth was unfavorably impacted by approximately $40 million as a result of quarter-over-quarter changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors in North America and Europe, related to the transition in distribution strategy in North America. The remaining decline is attributable to weaker retail performance. The largest contributor being the U.S., where the transition to our go-to-market is having an impact. Turning to geographies. This quarter Europe led the way with 2.2% internal growth. Consumables growth offset, no growth in Technologies. Revenue synergies are creating momentum for us in Europe. Based on our assessment, our Consumables outpaced the market for the second quarter in a row. Technologies in Europe was essentially flat. We were able to compensate for the unfavorable impact of a $5 million change in net equipment inventory and the slowdown ahead of the International Dental Show. As a reminder, in Europe and in Germany in particular, many of our customers wait for the Show to purchase new equipment. We are pleased to report that we had a record order intake at the event. Our success at the Show across both Technologies and Consumables highlighted the power of our merger. Rest of World was down 5.2% on top of last year's 7.5% growth. $5 million or 220 basis points of the decline in Q1 was driven by a change in net equipment inventory level at a distributor in Kennedy associated with the transition of our distribution strategy in North America. The remainder of the decline was driven by the Technologies segment, where we had very strong growth in certain countries last year. In Q4 2016, the region grew almost 10%, driven by Technologies. We continue to expect the Rest of World region to be our fastest growing region this year. U.S. sales were down 11% driven by decline in Technologies, as I already discussed, the primary driver of the decline was due to equipment inventory changes and to a lesser extent distributor retail performance. Our North American Consumables business grew low single digits. We were pleased to see the business accelerate sequentially from the fourth quarter. We continue to believe that North America market is stable and showing modest improvement. During the quarter, we continue to do our active capital allocation program; we bought back another $85 million of stock and announced a small, but strategically important acquisition, using our strong and flexible balance sheet will continue to be a lever for us to increase shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Josh who will review our fourth quarter financials and outlook. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. This morning I will discuss our U.S. GAAP results as well as our non-GAAP adjusted results. As I walk through the earnings performance, I will also point out major impacts of merger accounting on our results. In the first quarter, our reported revenue increased $127.9 million to $900.5 million, up 16.6%. Adjusted sales of our combined businesses excluding precious metals, declined 2.2% on a constant currency basis. Internal growth declined 4.7% excluding a 250 basis point favorable impact from net acquisitions. As Jeff already explained, overall sales were unfavorably impacted by approximately $40 million or 430 basis points as a result of net changes in equipment inventory levels at distributors related to our transition and distribution strategy in North America. Foreign exchange movements were a headwind of revenue of 130 basis points. As a reminder, these growth percentages reflect the performance of the combined business as if the merger had been completed on January 1, 2016. Jeff already addressed revenue growth by geography and segments. We have provided reconciliation tables for every segment and region that will help you understand how the GAAP reported revenue and internal growth come together. U.S. GAAP gross profit was $492 million, up $73.1 million or 17.5% from $418.9 million in 2016. Gross profit as a percentage of sales excluding precious metal content, decreased by 20 basis points to 55.3% from 55.5% in the prior year. As you can see on the non-GAAP reconciliation tables, the gross profit margin was negatively impacted by 360 basis points, mostly due to the effects of step up amortization and other merger-related items as compared to 510 basis points last year. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 58.9%, down 170 basis points for the quarter. The majority of the decline is associated with a lower gross profit rate on equipment associated with the timing of the merger. Last year's gross margin was favorably impacted by the consolidation of only the strongest sales month for the quarter for Sirona, with a more favorable product mix. Reported SG&A expense, which includes R&D, was $404.7 million, up $62.6 million or 18.3% versus last year. This equates to 45.5% of sales, excluding precious metals, 20 basis points above prior year. Reductions in business combination related costs, fair value adjustments as well as amortization of purchased intangible assets and similar items benefited the rate by 330 basis points. These benefits largely compensated for rate increases driven by the lack of revenues associated with equipment inventory reductions, biennial trade shows and other selling events as well as the effects of acquisitions and foreign exchange. Adjusted for non-GAAP items, including amortization expense and other costs related to the merger, SG&A expense was $377.3 million or 42.3% of sales excluding precious metals, representing an increase of 390 basis points. This year, IDS and selling events added approximately 135 basis points and lower sales from dealer inventory reduction also impacted the rate by approximately 180 basis points. FX and acquisitions cost us about 50 basis points. The rest of the increase is the balance of investments in selling and R&D, offsetting savings in G&A. Restructuring expenses were $3.1 million, down from $4.1 million last year. In total, GAAP operating income was $84.2 million, up $11.5 million or 15.8% from last year. Excluding the non-GAAP items set forth in our non-GAAP financial measures, adjusted operating margin was 16.6%, down 560 basis points compared to 22.2% last year. As discussed, the gross profit margin rate was down 170 basis points with favorable impacts from the timing of the merger last year and unfavorable impacts of from equipment distributor inventory reductions this year. In addition to this headwind, operating margins for the current year were impacted by higher operating expense rates by 390 basis points as discussed a moment ago. Net interest and other income and expense for the first quarter increased by $2.3 million compared to the prior year. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded U.S. GAAP income tax expense of $16.9 million versus a $57.9 million benefit last year. As a reminder, last year's first quarter taxes benefited from a $76.1 million valuation allowance release related to the merger. This year we have $6.3 million of discrete excess tax benefits related to employee share-based compensation. Per our existing policy, we exclude discrete tax items from adjusted earnings. On an annual basis, we now estimate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 19.2% compared to 23% in the first quarter last year and 20.8% for the full year 2016. Our lower tax rate is a benefit resulting from the complementary tax attributes of the merged companies. Q1 U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Dentsply Sirona was $59.8 million, down 52.1% from the prior year. First quarter diluted GAAP EPS was $0.26 compared to $0.70 in the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP net income declined 7.1% to $113.7 million. The decline in net income reflects the lack of revenue largely associated with changes in net equipment inventory levels at certain distributors. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.49 compared to $0.69 last year. The $0.20 decline in adjusted EPS was driven by the effects of the higher share count, partially offset by additional two months of Sirona and the effects of the distributor equipment inventory changes. In addition, FX created a $0.03 headwind. For a reconciliation of GAAP EPS to non-GAAP adjusted EPS, please see our earnings press release. The year-over-year comparisons in the cash flow statement are less meaningful this quarter, given the timing of the closing of the merger in February last year. I will discuss elements of the cash flow statement this year highlighting the key drivers. Cash flow from operating activities during the quarter was $82.5 million. Cash used in investing activities is $41.1 million. Capital expenditures were $31.1 million for the quarter. We continue to expect CapEx for the year to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million. During the quarter, we paid $78 million for share repurchases and paid $18 million in dividends. Now turning to guidance. For fiscal 2017, we continue to expect adjusted non-GAAP EPS in the range of $2.80 to $2.90. Our guidance includes the following assumptions: Constant currency sales growth to range from 4% to 6%. This includes approximately 150 basis points of net benefit from acquisitions' divestitures, implying internal growth of 2.5% to 4.5%. At current exchange rates, this translates to reported revenues, excluding precious metals, of $3.95 billion to $4.03 billion. We now expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be 19.2%. Our EPS range implies a full year diluted share count of approximately 231 million to 233 million shares versus 222 million in 2016. This reflects approximately $0.09 of headwind at the midpoint and is simply a function of the timing of the merger. We still anticipate FX headwinds of $0.08 to $0.10 for 2017. As we explained on our last call, we will continue to experience headwinds associated with inventory reductions. For now, the inventory reductions are expected to continue to negatively impact our net sales into the third quarter of 2017 by approximately $50 million to $60 million in total. As other market channels are brought online in the third and fourth quarter, sales through these channels could offset the majority of the mentioned inventory reduction resulting in a net of $10 million to $20 million unfavorable impact on our revenues for the remainder of the year. We expect this to translate into a much stronger back half of the year. As always, I suggest our investors evaluate our business on an annual basis as our quarterly progression can vary. I will now turn the call back to Jeff. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks, Josh. As the dental market grows, Dentsply Sirona will truly be the partner of choice to deliver better, safer, faster dental care to meet the growing demand. Dentistry's importance is being recognized as a critical driver of overall health. In the past quarter alone, multiple studies have confirmed the importance of oral health. At the American Stroke Association's international conference, research was presented linking periodontal disease as a potential cause for stroke. A large study in Japan found that patients who retain more of their natural teeth were less likely to develop dementia. In March, the Journal of The American Medical Association published an article highlighting data that showed that poor oral health can trigger autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. In both developed and developing markets, a heightened awareness about the importance of dental care is driving increased demand. Coupled with sustainable demographic trends, our industry has a long runway of growth ahead. A significant part of our market is private pay as other health care providers brace for health care reform, our customers can focus on how to best serve their patients. At the IDS, it was clear that dental professionals want to treat their patients with best-in-class integrated solutions. Dentsply Sirona can best support the individual practitioners and group practices, with efficient and effective end-to-end workflows. As many of you know, group practices are the fastest-growing segment of the market, and an area where Dentsply Sirona is significantly underpenetrated, particularly in terms of equipment. One of the rationales per the merger was that by coming together, we could offer groups an unmatched value proposition. With the broadest clinical education platform, end-to-end solutions that create more efficient practices and technologies that greatly enhance the patient experience, Dentsply Sirona is an ideal manufacturer partner for the groups. In Q1, we expanded our relationship with Aspen Dental, which has 600 practices across 36 states. Clinicians in Aspen branded practices made the decision to implement our new Nupro Freedom Cordless Prophy hand piece throughout their offices. They were one of the first groups to embrace the advantages of the product, which includes one-of-a-kind infection prevention, reduced noise and exceptional ergonomics for hygienists. We have a solid foundation with group practices, but we have a significant opportunity to bring more value to current customers and to bring on new ones. We will continue to focus more resources there and develop products that can better support our customers and differentiate us from the competition. This fact was evident at the International Dental Show in March. We launched 50 new products and solutions at the Show itself. At the Show, we unveiled our new root to crown solution. As the market leader in imaging and doing restorative products, Dentsply Sirona can now provide an end-to-end integrated solution for root canals. This makes treatment better, safer and faster. Dental professionals understand that enabling technologies are the key to providing integrated procedural solutions. At the IDS, it was clear that digital dentistry is happening today and Dentsply Sirona is best positioned to accelerate the benefits for this megatrend. 3D imaging and single-visit dentistry are both at the tipping point. With the launch of our low-dose mode for the Orthophos SL, we are another step closer to making 3D imaging a standard of care. With lower radiation levels, we've made using our 3D imaging safer, while still offering best-in-class X-ray quality. For the first time at the IDS, we announced opening up CEREC systems to enable export of our STL files. Without compromising the integrity of our unmatched Chairside system, opening up the Omnicam will accelerate adoption of our product for digital impressions. Many digital labs have gone from being opponents to digital to supporters. Digital impressions makes labs workflows more accurate and efficient helps them better serve their customers. By opening up the system, we have facilitated better coordination between dental labs and individual practitioners. Now as dentists go from impression materials to digital, our Omnicam represents the best choice in terms of quality, ease-of-use and effectiveness for both dentists and labs alike and we still have the number one selling impression material. Awareness and acceptance is not only rising in professional community, but among consumers as well. Single-visit dentistry is differentiating dentists to their patients who are beginning to ask for CEREC by name. In May, we launched a direct-to-consumer promotional campaign in conjunction with 1-800-Dentist to celebrate Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales to raise the profile of our technology and educate potential U.S. patients on the benefits of CEREC and single-visit dentistry. We also ramped up our efforts to reach different demographics by appearing on well-known stations such as MSNBC, CNN and ESPN. The other critical component to accelerating adoption is the partnership of our distributors. This morning we announced a new go-to-market strategy in the U.S. The U.S. market is the largest in the world and critical to our long-term success. In September, Patterson and Henry Schein, the two largest distributors in the country, will have access to our full distribution product line. Our consumables have been part of both Henry Schein and Patterson since the early days of dental distribution in the U.S. We have a unique and important relationship with Patterson, who has been an exclusive partner selling equipment and technology in the United States. Together we have been a driving force in the adoption of digital technologies and our new agreement ensures that our companies continue driving penetration of digital technologies and solutions in this important market. We're also excited to expand our relationship with Henry Schein and are confident that adding our equipment lines to their sales and service infrastructure should be complementary, as they already know us and our products well. Schein can leverage the knowledge and success they've had selling our technology in Europe. With both distributors carrying our full distributed product line, we will expand our reach into the U. S. market. Awareness about the digital and single-visit dentistry will increase and expand the market. With CEREC only 17% penetrated and 3D even less, there is significant room for growth with both Patterson and Henry Schein. Equally important with both Patterson and Henry Schein, carrying our full distributed product lines, we will be able to reach the majority of U.S. dental professionals with our end-to-end solutions. As they adopt our full solutions, we will grow faster. As our installed base increases, we will have even more opportunities to cross-sell our product portfolio. A critical component to cross-selling is also integrating our products. Our leading Treatment Centers are now integrated with our endodontic and implantology systems, further differentiating our products. Dentsply Sirona Treatment Centers are truly the centerpiece of the dental office and critical hubs in our ecosystem. We had another record quarter before the IDS in Q1. We also continue to have success selling our Celtra Duo Blocks and other CEREC consumables to new users of our technology. This is rapidly growing multi-hundred million dollar market. This synergy opportunity is significant. We are ramping sales rapidly. As our one global team works hand-in-hand, we are seeing clear benefits. Where our commercial strategies are critical to driving growth, innovation will remain the hallmark of Dentsply Sirona. At the American Association of Endodontic's annual meeting, we launched our new CEREC Ortho 1.2 software and the new self-ligating bracket system In-Ovation X. This is the first meaningful innovation of self-ligating brackets in many years and reduces both treatment time and professional chair time compared to the current standard of care in this category. Our lab business has a slew of new products in the market. Materials like Celtra Press and Cercon xt are driving momentum in the marketplace. We continue to invest in research and development as well as our sales and service infrastructure. With over 4,000 sales and service professionals around the globe, our reach is unparalleled in the industry. Our merger is enabling us to make these investments as we generate cost savings. We have many multiple reorganizations and country formation projects in process. Our cost synergies programs remain on track and will ramp into 2018. Top-line growth remains at the forefront of our priorities and strategies, but we will also remain committed to driving leverage through our P&L and driving increased profitability. We anticipate earnings growth to accelerate in the second half of the year. Finally, our capital allocation continues to be a key component of our strategy. With our strong balance sheet, we remain focused on our pipeline of deals and a disciplined approach. In addition to acquisitions, we intend to consistently return capital to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. I'd like to thank our customers for their loyal support, trust and enthusiasm for Dentsply Sirona. We are pleased to announce our new agreements with Henry Schein and with Patterson today. We are truly excited about the possibility of growing together. I'd also like to extend a special thanks to our employees. Integrating two companies can be difficult and many have been working tirelessly to make Dentsply Sirona a success. Their commitment to improve the lives of dental professionals and their patients is inspiring. We will now address your questions. Operator, please proceed. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Certainly. We will now take our first question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Thanks. Good morning. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Good morning. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC I guess, Jeff, starting with the Henry Schein deal. Can you speak to the importance or the somewhat earlier start date, being September 1? I was previously under the impression that the Patterson exclusivity would run through the end of September. And is there any relevancy to the three-year period? And I guess, part two, maybe for Joshua. You seem to point to a slightly or a wider band for the inventory de-stocking headwind this year, $50 million to $60 million versus the prior $50 million. Can you just elaborate on the shift there? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks, Brandon; important question. Of course, we're celebrating today the announcement of Henry Schein. As we stated on our call in February, the transition to opening up distribution has its challenges. And we made it clear that we were changing our go-to-market and we felt, as an organization and working with Patterson, that this was the right time to be able to announce this. This is a significant decision for us. We also felt, by doing this now, we were able to stay focused on our exclusivity with Patterson through the summer, but be able to bring Schein on for our September and our DS World, as we move forward to the back half of our year. The significance of the three years is just an initial term for us. We expect to be doing business with our full distributed lines with Schein for years to come. We're very excited about how our teams have worked together, as we've seen the success in Europe and what we've been able to do on the distributed consumable side with Henry Schein. The time is now, ever since it was announced that we would be changing our strategy and opening it up, and to get the clarity in the marketplace were exactly what we're doing. In the absence of clarity, we have issues with our customers, we have issues with distribution reps, we have rumors, and frankly, we have our own people wondering what's going to happen. Now we have that clarity about how we're moving forward and this is important. And certainly, we have confidence in our long-standing relationship with Patterson on the technology side, certainly, it's been 20 years of exclusive with CEREC which is very special to us. Henry Schein has had and continues to have a special relationship with us, has had exclusive and continues to have CEREC exclusive in many areas. And bringing it all together today, allows us to move forward in a very powerful way, get the field to focus on the exclusive they have, to understand the way forward for us and to get down to what's most important, and that's taking care of the customer and executing on our plan, which is why we talked about the second half being where we expect it to grow faster. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Hey, Brandon, this is Josh. Just on the question about the band of inventory. I think you're referring to what we said last quarter, when we talked about a $50 million net impact. Just to be clear on what I had mentioned was that we expect a $50 million to $60 million impact going forward from here on out, with the bulk of that happening in Q2. The net impact of all of this should be $10 million to $20 million the remainder of the year. I think it's hard to pinpoint a specific number obviously, because ultimately inventory is a function of retail performance. And as Jeff alluded to, transition can cause some slowness there, but of course, clarity is important to help get that going again. So I think from a modeling perspective, the way you should think about it is, $50 million to $60 million, bulk of that in Q2, and then like I said, remainder of the year, $10 million to $20 million. If there's a little bit more than $50 million, we think there're opportunities that we might be able to offset it with some other market channels, but again we'll continue to keep you updated. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, Brandon. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you, guys. I guess two questions. The first one, just – are there going to be any differences in how you support Patterson and Schein for maybe a sales and education perspective? Does that mean we need to think about margin profile of your business through Schein or Patterson as different at all between the two in the U.S? That's the first question. And then Josh, just on those inventory comments. I guess I completely misunderstand in here. Guidance as of last quarter was that we would see $40 million to $60 million of the inventory headwinds for the year. We saw, I believe, $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter. Now you're saying there's another $50 million to $60 million – where's this $50 million to $60 million all of a sudden coming from? That's a new number to me. So if you can help me out there, that would be great. Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Okay. Jeff, Patterson has a 20-year experience with our product offering and infrastructure and training available today. We will work with Schein. We have a plan in place that we are not going to compromise our customers on their training and education of this and that's why we're confident about bringing on both distributors because of our ability to take care of the customer and expand our reach. And we have a lot of confidence in Henry Schein's capability to do this. With regard to the margin profile, we're not going to get into the contracts that's been agreed to by both parties, but we are confident that the way we've set up our structure benefits both Henry Schein and Patterson. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. So Jeff, just to, again, go back on the inventory. We talked about a net number for the year last call. You saw an impact this quarter and I talked about the $50 million to $60 million additional impact going forward. That will be bulk of it in Q2, could leak into Q3 as well. And then of course, we talked about is a net number, which means we believe there's some offset opportunity from other channels coming online. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Jeff, I think it's important to understand that what we're talking about at the end of the day is $50 million to $60 million. We absolutely believe that as other channels come online, there will be a net effect. So we have not changed from that perspective and we certainly also believe that there are global implications of this and opportunities for us. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, operator. Next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, thanks. A couple. First, was there any – I mean, if we look – Technologies were still down just under 4% after adjusting for Patterson. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that was a pre-IDS slowdown? I think Schein, this morning, talked about 197 deduction for (37:01) forward sales in the year-end. So do you have any impact there, or is this also just a function of Patterson reps maybe losing a little bit more focus? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Well, I think, certainly that played a role in this. That's why we wanted to get the clarity out there to the field exactly what was going on. There were too many rumors that we're stalling fails and that was critical to what was important there. And certainly ahead of the IDS, it always stall sales as they look forward to see what we're going to bring out. Now on our last call, we've talked about announcing 50 new products and technology and that certainly played a role for us. We were pleased though with what we were seeing, particularly in Germany and Southern Europe, but there was, in general, slowdown. And this doesn't just affect Europe, but this affects other parts of the world as they are looking to find out what exactly is Dentsply Sirona, but I would also highlight that our Consumables showed consecutive sequential growth in Europe ahead of this. There were no delays there. We feel good about what that tells us, we're able to do in the marketplace, but it is a function of – this was our first IDS together. The marketplace wanted to see what's Dentsply Sirona really about. Frankly, yes, we've been together for a year, but the IDS is such a big showcase. And to be able to see the order intake and reach records for all of our product areas and segments. And in fact, CAD/CAM benefit and specifically, CEREC, clear double-digits from us coming together. As we've always said, at Dentsply Sirona, we believe we'll accelerate the adoption of our technologies. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then just one follow up on CEREC dynamics. Obviously, we saw Schein did a deal with Ivoclar. Well, can you just maybe talk on some of the shifting pieces you're seeing in the market on competitive dynamics, I guess, in general for CAD/CAM? And maybe the post-IDS reception to you guys opening up CEREC? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah sure. In a moment, I'm going to pass the call to Chris. This highlights what we've been saying to the market for years. The market is going digital. Single-visit dentistry matters to the dental professional and the patient. You cannot ignore that whether you're a materials company or an equipment company. And I would argue every dental company understands the impact that this megatrend is having. And of course, this IDS showcased the fact that Dentsply Sirona is in the best position, but of course we're going to have competitors come on to try to play a role in this. As we've said, we're only 17% penetrated in the U.S. Imagine what it is around the rest of the globe. With that, I'll turn it to Chris. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Tycho, it's Chris. I think this is case when you're successful in market, it's going to attract attention. I think that's what we have here. And as Jeff mentioned, digital dentistry is here to stay. We're at tipping point. From a competitive standpoint, more attention to the category is going to drive more interest and that's going to accelerate penetration. And we think that's good for us. Obviously we've got a good healthy respect for our competition. We're staying close to technological developments, but that's it. We're also very pleased with our technology platform that comes from over 20 years of experience and continuously leading both in innovation and also in markets insight. So again, we're the clear leader here. We're the basis for doctors being able to perform single-visit dentistry. We're pleased with the near-term innovations, including CEREC Open and the new software that Jeff mentioned earlier. And we're continuing to make significant investments in our R&D portfolio to stay on the forefront of technology. So again, we're pleased with our position, and again, I think that overall, more attention on the category is going to helpful to accelerating penetration. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Certainly, 30 years of experience, R&D, knowhow and the team we have in place, with not only equipment, but materials today is even stronger for the future for our CEREC. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. You bet. Operator As a reminder, we are taking one question from each caller in the interest of time. We'll take our next question from Mr. Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I want to just follow-up in a specific way on the Rest of World piece. And then, just a couple of clarifications. On Rest of World, the result was a little bit below our model. I wonder if you can reflect and I guess, it isn't necessarily have to be specific to Rest of World, on the timing of the IDS. If you look at the last few iterations of the IDS it was middle of month. You had a couple of weeks in there to complete deliveries. Did the timing of the IDS being close to the end of March, the end of the quarter have any impact? And then I have a follow-up. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Steve, it's tough to say how much timing of the IDS would play, but keep in mind that we had a difficult comp coming in, 7.5% last year and after finishing the year strong. We still believe that the Rest of World will be our fastest growing region. That hasn't changed. We've got 120 countries in the Rest of World. Asia was slower than we expected, but we expect that, that will improve in the second quarter and make up for the slowness on that. We were pleased what we saw in Latin America growth, even given the restructuring efforts there. So we expect that Rest of World will play a critical role in the future. I think, clarifying how we're going forward in Canada, that plays a role in Rest of World and our North America will support that and that had an impact, but in general, the offering we have in Rest of World, we expect to continue to generate sales in the back half of the year. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for that. And I just want to follow-up on Jeff's question actually about equipment trends. I mean, given what you've seen in the DTA data, the consolidated industry data on equipment trends in the U.S. through the first quarter, how are you thinking about the equipment demand profile, not necessarily in a Dentsply Sirona specific way, but the trajectory for equipment demand in the U.S? Thanks. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Steve, it's Chris. First off, in terms of the DTA data, there's no longer any DTA on large equipment available. So from that standpoint, again, some of the market data that may have been available is no longer. That said as we look at it, it's a little bit tough for us in terms of a barometer for the factors that Jeff mentioned, obviously, with the go-to-market strategy change, but in the quarter not announcing the clarity in terms of exactly what that is, we do think it had an impact on us. As we look at it, we do think that underlying demand is solid and stable, but it was probably not the quarter to use as the barometer for that. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. And again, today, we announced a major change in our go-to-market in the U.S. And this is one that is going to have a short and long-term impact for Dentsply Sirona, and we need to focus on how important that will affect our equipment sales with both in place and our ability for Paterson to finish strong before September. Keep in mind that as we go into DS World, we'll now have a new message to the marketplace about what's possible for them. And this should make it easier for the reps to be able to sell the product and the adoption to increase. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks a bunch. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. You bet. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks very much. Jeff, just expand a little bit on the comment you made in the call about feeling like you're underpenetrated in the group practices. I think that was mainly a U.S. comment. Is your go-to-market strategy changing beyond adding Schein? If you could just expand on how you're going to push more into DSOs, that will be helpful? Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Well look first of all, I think, we have a strong practice in the DSOs. Keep in mind, we go through distribution and direct with our specialty products. That won't change, but we're aggressively going after DSOs by bringing together how we present ourselves with the DSO to make sure they get the full benefit of our clinical education, our 360 programs and have integrated solutions deal with the full facets of what we're able to provide, root to crown, Class II procedures, implantology. By being able to focus that, we believe we'll have more of an impact in the DSOs. So there's a lot of opportunity for us, because we want to not only improve our share of wallet, but increase the number of DSOs that we're working with. We're already working with most of the largest DSOs. So it is about putting our organization together, investing in those resources and being able to make sure that the focus is on an area that's growing faster than the market. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. Yeah just wanted to go back to the softer equipment number. The inventory wind-down does seem to be a bit of a moving target. So I'm just curious at this point, how much confidence do you feel like you have in this revised number? Is that something that you've worked more closely with Patterson to get your hands around? And then just related to that, Jeff, I believe you mentioned weaker retail performance in your prepared remarks, particularly in the U.S. as something that was a headwind or a drag. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what you meant by retail performance and how that's separate from the inventory issue that we've discussed? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Sure. Again, I think that comes back to the clarity of what's happening in the market. Bob, I can't tell you how many reps are hearing that we're imminent to opening up distribution. The distractions that, that has had, which has created uncertainty and uncertainty is never good for a rep, for an organization. And that had impact in what we were able to sell. I think with this clarity and the fact with our confidence with Patterson and what we've been able to do over the last 20 years with the exclusivity, we can get back to doing what we want to focus on, which is executing and selling the product. You also have to keep in mind that last year we introduced a new way of thinking about Chairside, with using Zirconia. We came out with the SpeedFire, which also led to changes in our milling unit, wet-dry. Those also had impacts for the prior year on this. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Bob, with regard to inventory – this is Josh, just to provide clarity. So recognize there was a $40 million change year-over-year related to inventory. That was Q1, right? We talked about an additional $50 million to $60 million coming, right, but for the remainder of the year, a net of $10 million to $20 million, which is to say that there's going to be an offset to that. So what we've said is, last call we talked about $50 million. We're talking about a similar range here. Again, ultimately retail, it will dictate how much or how little this will be, but we're still in the general range as we're talking about. So it's never a perfect target, but I don't want to give you the impression that it's a moving target. It's still within the same range. It's just a function of, remember, we talked about this being a tale of two halves in terms of the year. We talked about the first half having a significant headwind in inventory. We talked about strong growth in the back half of the year, right? We reiterated our guidance and so we're just reiterating that same message. We obviously had the first impact in Q1. You'll continue to see impact in Q2 and you'll get the benefit of the other market or the channels coming on line, which will offset that headwind in the back half of the year which will drive our growth. So the net is in the same realm, right. Again, we can't pinpoint it exactly, but I don't want you to walk away thinking there's a significant change here, because there isn't. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. No there really isn't. Again, the big picture is about the net result for the year. And we haven't changed that. We've said the first quarter was going to be challenged. And actually, it would also be the first half and it was all about the second half. So I want to be clear that we continue to be on track believing that what we gave the guidance, and that's why we haven't changed our guidance. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll try to ask both upfront. So first one, Jeff, just your thoughts on capital allocation and possibly getting more aggressive on the share repo. It seems like you're sensing or seeing the worldwide dental market picking up. You've got broader distribution going forward. You called out several times you expect momentum to increase in the back half of the year and sort of continue into 2018 and you're sitting here on a very solid balance sheet. So just your thoughts on maybe flexing the balance sheet a bit more here in the near-term. And then the second question, just quickly is a lot of moving parts for 2Q. I mean, you guys have hit on inventory but you also have sort of the ship outs going on from IDS. So curious if you want to give any clarity on the EPS cadence on line and just how to think about the moving parts for the remainder of the year? Thanks guys. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Right. We have a clear buy back in place. We've already deployed over $1 billion in capital – in acquisitions and buy back. We continue to do that. That's an important lever. We have a very strong balance sheet, which we will continue to use. So I don't see that changing. Certainly, that's part of what we've talked about. We also said that we were going to do $50 million to $100 million per quarter. We did $85 million this quarter. So we're staying on track with what we believe. With regard to the EPS, clearly we don't get into quarterly guidance, but the back half assumes that we expect to have acceleration on that. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, operator. Next question, please? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff, Chris, Josh and Derek. So I know you guys can't talk too much about the terms of these new U.S. distribution deals, but I guess I first have a question is, will a U.S. sale of CEREC through Schein be more profitable to you than what CEREC unit profit margin has been under Patterson previously? And then also is Schein going sell just CEREC in the U.S. for Chairside, CAD/CAM, crown restoration, or are they still going to have the option to sell other Chairside crown restoration systems if they want to? Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks for the question. Again, this is about Schein having our full distributed line. They'll have everything with regard to CAD/CAM as well as our imaging products, our Treatment Centers and our instruments. We're not going to get into margin profile. Obviously, we believe that this structure is in the best interest of both parties and it's about accelerating growth for both of us. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. And the other quick thing, this is more of a comment than really just a question, but I still don't really get the notion of the Patterson's sales force distraction, that they know they're still going to be selling it going forward. You think they'd want to work harder to lock-in sales before a new distributor comes in. I don't understand why they'd lay down in this situation but again that's sort of the sidebar comment I guess I'll look forward to seeing you guys at our conference next week and we can hopefully talk about this in more detail. Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Look, again, until you have clarity in the market, it leads to confusion. And you have to understand that, that is the fact. When Patterson on their call in November announced that they would be opening up distribution with it, that brought certain uncertainty for the marketplace. We feel we've dealt with that. I mean, we're very excited with what we've announced today with Patterson as well and we think that will have an impact for us. So both Henry Schein and Patterson, coming together understanding what is going to be exactly what we do moving forward will allow everyone to focus on execution. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. This is Vik Chopra in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the Consumables business, kind of what areas of strength you've seen, maybe specialty versus general products? And what you're seeing in terms of ASPs? And my second question is on gross margins. How should we think about gross margins heading into the rest of year? And can we expect any expansion over last year? Thanks. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Vik, it's Chris. Relative to the Consumables, I mean we have pretty solid and consistent growth really across the various SBUs, if you will, both on the Chairside as well as on the specialties, particularly solid, relative to endo. Again we look pretty solid underlying U.S. sell-through trends which again, we're pleased with. Europe was very solid from a core Consumables standpoint. So again, I think, that we feel good about how that business is executing. There's a number of new innovations that we showed at the IDS. New products really do drive those businesses pretty significantly, which again we're pleased with what we've brought to market. And again I think that relative to the margins or the pricing, again we're able to hold price fine. We're able to take reasonable price generally on these businesses. So again I don't think we see any significant change in those competitive dynamics. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Vik, as far as gross margin for the year, we don't get into that level of detail. What I would tell you is that this quarter, margins were impacted by the timing of the merger last year. Remember, last year had the strongest selling month for Sirona, so that gave us a difficult comparison. We talked about margins year-over-year in terms of operating margins to be similar to last year, but that actually implies underlying growth because again, you'll recall that last year we benefited from that strong selling month. So overall, remember gross margins, you have a lot of moving parts in there between product mix and FX. And so we'll just talk about the operating margin level for the year. Operator Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Well thank you, everyone, for joining us today on today's conference call, and thanks for your interest on Dentsply Sirona. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and of course, we'll update you again on August. Have a good day. Operator Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

We will now take our first question from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Thanks. Good morning. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Good morning. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC I guess, Jeff, starting with the Henry Schein deal. Can you speak to the importance or the somewhat earlier start date, being September 1? I was previously under the impression that the Patterson exclusivity would run through the end of September. And is there any relevancy to the three-year period? And I guess, part two, maybe for Joshua. You seem to point to a slightly or a wider band for the inventory de-stocking headwind this year, $50 million to $60 million versus the prior $50 million. Can you just elaborate on the shift there? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks, Brandon; important question. Of course, we're celebrating today the announcement of Henry Schein. As we stated on our call in February, the transition to opening up distribution has its challenges. And we made it clear that we were changing our go-to-market and we felt, as an organization and working with Patterson, that this was the right time to be able to announce this. This is a significant decision for us. We also felt, by doing this now, we were able to stay focused on our exclusivity with Patterson through the summer, but be able to bring Schein on for our September and our DS World, as we move forward to the back half of our year. The significance of the three years is just an initial term for us. We expect to be doing business with our full distributed lines with Schein for years to come. We're very excited about how our teams have worked together, as we've seen the success in Europe and what we've been able to do on the distributed consumable side with Henry Schein. The time is now, ever since it was announced that we would be changing our strategy and opening it up, and to get the clarity in the marketplace were exactly what we're doing. In the absence of clarity, we have issues with our customers, we have issues with distribution reps, we have rumors, and frankly, we have our own people wondering what's going to happen. Now we have that clarity about how we're moving forward and this is important. And certainly, we have confidence in our long-standing relationship with Patterson on the technology side, certainly, it's been 20 years of exclusive with CEREC which is very special to us. Henry Schein has had and continues to have a special relationship with us, has had exclusive and continues to have CEREC exclusive in many areas. And bringing it all together today, allows us to move forward in a very powerful way, get the field to focus on the exclusive they have, to understand the way forward for us and to get down to what's most important, and that's taking care of the customer and executing on our plan, which is why we talked about the second half being where we expect it to grow faster. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Hey, Brandon, this is Josh. Just on the question about the band of inventory. I think you're referring to what we said last quarter, when we talked about a $50 million net impact. Just to be clear on what I had mentioned was that we expect a $50 million to $60 million impact going forward from here on out, with the bulk of that happening in Q2. The net impact of all of this should be $10 million to $20 million the remainder of the year. I think it's hard to pinpoint a specific number obviously, because ultimately inventory is a function of retail performance. And as Jeff alluded to, transition can cause some slowness there, but of course, clarity is important to help get that going again. So I think from a modeling perspective, the way you should think about it is, $50 million to $60 million, bulk of that in Q2, and then like I said, remainder of the year, $10 million to $20 million. If there's a little bit more than $50 million, we think there're opportunities that we might be able to offset it with some other market channels, but again we'll continue to keep you updated. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC Okay. Thank you. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, Brandon. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Jeff D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thank you, guys. I guess two questions. The first one, just – are there going to be any differences in how you support Patterson and Schein for maybe a sales and education perspective? Does that mean we need to think about margin profile of your business through Schein or Patterson as different at all between the two in the U.S? That's the first question. And then Josh, just on those inventory comments. I guess I completely misunderstand in here. Guidance as of last quarter was that we would see $40 million to $60 million of the inventory headwinds for the year. We saw, I believe, $40 million to $50 million in the first quarter. Now you're saying there's another $50 million to $60 million – where's this $50 million to $60 million all of a sudden coming from? That's a new number to me. So if you can help me out there, that would be great. Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Okay. Jeff, Patterson has a 20-year experience with our product offering and infrastructure and training available today. We will work with Schein. We have a plan in place that we are not going to compromise our customers on their training and education of this and that's why we're confident about bringing on both distributors because of our ability to take care of the customer and expand our reach. And we have a lot of confidence in Henry Schein's capability to do this. With regard to the margin profile, we're not going to get into the contracts that's been agreed to by both parties, but we are confident that the way we've set up our structure benefits both Henry Schein and Patterson. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. So Jeff, just to, again, go back on the inventory. We talked about a net number for the year last call. You saw an impact this quarter and I talked about the $50 million to $60 million additional impact going forward. That will be bulk of it in Q2, could leak into Q3 as well. And then of course, we talked about is a net number, which means we believe there's some offset opportunity from other channels coming online. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Jeff, I think it's important to understand that what we're talking about at the end of the day is $50 million to $60 million. We absolutely believe that as other channels come online, there will be a net effect. So we have not changed from that perspective and we certainly also believe that there are global implications of this and opportunities for us. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, operator. Next question, please. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, thanks. A couple. First, was there any – I mean, if we look – Technologies were still down just under 4% after adjusting for Patterson. Can you maybe just talk about how much of that was a pre-IDS slowdown? I think Schein, this morning, talked about 197 deduction for (37:01) forward sales in the year-end. So do you have any impact there, or is this also just a function of Patterson reps maybe losing a little bit more focus? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Well, I think, certainly that played a role in this. That's why we wanted to get the clarity out there to the field exactly what was going on. There were too many rumors that we're stalling fails and that was critical to what was important there. And certainly ahead of the IDS, it always stall sales as they look forward to see what we're going to bring out. Now on our last call, we've talked about announcing 50 new products and technology and that certainly played a role for us. We were pleased though with what we were seeing, particularly in Germany and Southern Europe, but there was, in general, slowdown. And this doesn't just affect Europe, but this affects other parts of the world as they are looking to find out what exactly is Dentsply Sirona, but I would also highlight that our Consumables showed consecutive sequential growth in Europe ahead of this. There were no delays there. We feel good about what that tells us, we're able to do in the marketplace, but it is a function of – this was our first IDS together. The marketplace wanted to see what's Dentsply Sirona really about. Frankly, yes, we've been together for a year, but the IDS is such a big showcase. And to be able to see the order intake and reach records for all of our product areas and segments. And in fact, CAD/CAM benefit and specifically, CEREC, clear double-digits from us coming together. As we've always said, at Dentsply Sirona, we believe we'll accelerate the adoption of our technologies. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then just one follow up on CEREC dynamics. Obviously, we saw Schein did a deal with Ivoclar. Well, can you just maybe talk on some of the shifting pieces you're seeing in the market on competitive dynamics, I guess, in general for CAD/CAM? And maybe the post-IDS reception to you guys opening up CEREC? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah sure. In a moment, I'm going to pass the call to Chris. This highlights what we've been saying to the market for years. The market is going digital. Single-visit dentistry matters to the dental professional and the patient. You cannot ignore that whether you're a materials company or an equipment company. And I would argue every dental company understands the impact that this megatrend is having. And of course, this IDS showcased the fact that Dentsply Sirona is in the best position, but of course we're going to have competitors come on to try to play a role in this. As we've said, we're only 17% penetrated in the U.S. Imagine what it is around the rest of the globe. With that, I'll turn it to Chris. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Tycho, it's Chris. I think this is case when you're successful in market, it's going to attract attention. I think that's what we have here. And as Jeff mentioned, digital dentistry is here to stay. We're at tipping point. From a competitive standpoint, more attention to the category is going to drive more interest and that's going to accelerate penetration. And we think that's good for us. Obviously we've got a good healthy respect for our competition. We're staying close to technological developments, but that's it. We're also very pleased with our technology platform that comes from over 20 years of experience and continuously leading both in innovation and also in markets insight. So again, we're the clear leader here. We're the basis for doctors being able to perform single-visit dentistry. We're pleased with the near-term innovations, including CEREC Open and the new software that Jeff mentioned earlier. And we're continuing to make significant investments in our R&D portfolio to stay on the forefront of technology. So again, we're pleased with our position, and again, I think that overall, more attention on the category is going to helpful to accelerating penetration. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Certainly, 30 years of experience, R&D, knowhow and the team we have in place, with not only equipment, but materials today is even stronger for the future for our CEREC. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. You bet. Operator As a reminder, we are taking one question from each caller in the interest of time. We'll take our next question from Mr. Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. I want to just follow-up in a specific way on the Rest of World piece. And then, just a couple of clarifications. On Rest of World, the result was a little bit below our model. I wonder if you can reflect and I guess, it isn't necessarily have to be specific to Rest of World, on the timing of the IDS. If you look at the last few iterations of the IDS it was middle of month. You had a couple of weeks in there to complete deliveries. Did the timing of the IDS being close to the end of March, the end of the quarter have any impact? And then I have a follow-up. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Steve, it's tough to say how much timing of the IDS would play, but keep in mind that we had a difficult comp coming in, 7.5% last year and after finishing the year strong. We still believe that the Rest of World will be our fastest growing region. That hasn't changed. We've got 120 countries in the Rest of World. Asia was slower than we expected, but we expect that, that will improve in the second quarter and make up for the slowness on that. We were pleased what we saw in Latin America growth, even given the restructuring efforts there. So we expect that Rest of World will play a critical role in the future. I think, clarifying how we're going forward in Canada, that plays a role in Rest of World and our North America will support that and that had an impact, but in general, the offering we have in Rest of World, we expect to continue to generate sales in the back half of the year. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for that. And I just want to follow-up on Jeff's question actually about equipment trends. I mean, given what you've seen in the DTA data, the consolidated industry data on equipment trends in the U.S. through the first quarter, how are you thinking about the equipment demand profile, not necessarily in a Dentsply Sirona specific way, but the trajectory for equipment demand in the U.S? Thanks. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Steve, it's Chris. First off, in terms of the DTA data, there's no longer any DTA on large equipment available. So from that standpoint, again, some of the market data that may have been available is no longer. That said as we look at it, it's a little bit tough for us in terms of a barometer for the factors that Jeff mentioned, obviously, with the go-to-market strategy change, but in the quarter not announcing the clarity in terms of exactly what that is, we do think it had an impact on us. As we look at it, we do think that underlying demand is solid and stable, but it was probably not the quarter to use as the barometer for that. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. And again, today, we announced a major change in our go-to-market in the U.S. And this is one that is going to have a short and long-term impact for Dentsply Sirona, and we need to focus on how important that will affect our equipment sales with both in place and our ability for Paterson to finish strong before September. Keep in mind that as we go into DS World, we'll now have a new message to the marketplace about what's possible for them. And this should make it easier for the reps to be able to sell the product and the adoption to increase. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks a bunch. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. You bet. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks very much. Jeff, just expand a little bit on the comment you made in the call about feeling like you're underpenetrated in the group practices. I think that was mainly a U.S. comment. Is your go-to-market strategy changing beyond adding Schein? If you could just expand on how you're going to push more into DSOs, that will be helpful? Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Well look first of all, I think, we have a strong practice in the DSOs. Keep in mind, we go through distribution and direct with our specialty products. That won't change, but we're aggressively going after DSOs by bringing together how we present ourselves with the DSO to make sure they get the full benefit of our clinical education, our 360 programs and have integrated solutions deal with the full facets of what we're able to provide, root to crown, Class II procedures, implantology. By being able to focus that, we believe we'll have more of an impact in the DSOs. So there's a lot of opportunity for us, because we want to not only improve our share of wallet, but increase the number of DSOs that we're working with. We're already working with most of the largest DSOs. So it is about putting our organization together, investing in those resources and being able to make sure that the focus is on an area that's growing faster than the market. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. Yeah just wanted to go back to the softer equipment number. The inventory wind-down does seem to be a bit of a moving target. So I'm just curious at this point, how much confidence do you feel like you have in this revised number? Is that something that you've worked more closely with Patterson to get your hands around? And then just related to that, Jeff, I believe you mentioned weaker retail performance in your prepared remarks, particularly in the U.S. as something that was a headwind or a drag. Could you maybe just elaborate a little bit on what you meant by retail performance and how that's separate from the inventory issue that we've discussed? Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Sure. Again, I think that comes back to the clarity of what's happening in the market. Bob, I can't tell you how many reps are hearing that we're imminent to opening up distribution. The distractions that, that has had, which has created uncertainty and uncertainty is never good for a rep, for an organization. And that had impact in what we were able to sell. I think with this clarity and the fact with our confidence with Patterson and what we've been able to do over the last 20 years with the exclusivity, we can get back to doing what we want to focus on, which is executing and selling the product. You also have to keep in mind that last year we introduced a new way of thinking about Chairside, with using Zirconia. We came out with the SpeedFire, which also led to changes in our milling unit, wet-dry. Those also had impacts for the prior year on this. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Bob, with regard to inventory – this is Josh, just to provide clarity. So recognize there was a $40 million change year-over-year related to inventory. That was Q1, right? We talked about an additional $50 million to $60 million coming, right, but for the remainder of the year, a net of $10 million to $20 million, which is to say that there's going to be an offset to that. So what we've said is, last call we talked about $50 million. We're talking about a similar range here. Again, ultimately retail, it will dictate how much or how little this will be, but we're still in the general range as we're talking about. So it's never a perfect target, but I don't want to give you the impression that it's a moving target. It's still within the same range. It's just a function of, remember, we talked about this being a tale of two halves in terms of the year. We talked about the first half having a significant headwind in inventory. We talked about strong growth in the back half of the year, right? We reiterated our guidance and so we're just reiterating that same message. We obviously had the first impact in Q1. You'll continue to see impact in Q2 and you'll get the benefit of the other market or the channels coming on line, which will offset that headwind in the back half of the year which will drive our growth. So the net is in the same realm, right. Again, we can't pinpoint it exactly, but I don't want you to walk away thinking there's a significant change here, because there isn't. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. No there really isn't. Again, the big picture is about the net result for the year. And we haven't changed that. We've said the first quarter was going to be challenged. And actually, it would also be the first half and it was all about the second half. So I want to be clear that we continue to be on track believing that what we gave the guidance, and that's why we haven't changed our guidance. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jon Block from Stifel. Jonathan Block - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I'll try to ask both upfront. So first one, Jeff, just your thoughts on capital allocation and possibly getting more aggressive on the share repo. It seems like you're sensing or seeing the worldwide dental market picking up. You've got broader distribution going forward. You called out several times you expect momentum to increase in the back half of the year and sort of continue into 2018 and you're sitting here on a very solid balance sheet. So just your thoughts on maybe flexing the balance sheet a bit more here in the near-term. And then the second question, just quickly is a lot of moving parts for 2Q. I mean, you guys have hit on inventory but you also have sort of the ship outs going on from IDS. So curious if you want to give any clarity on the EPS cadence on line and just how to think about the moving parts for the remainder of the year? Thanks guys. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Right. We have a clear buy back in place. We've already deployed over $1 billion in capital – in acquisitions and buy back. We continue to do that. That's an important lever. We have a very strong balance sheet, which we will continue to use. So I don't see that changing. Certainly, that's part of what we've talked about. We also said that we were going to do $50 million to $100 million per quarter. We did $85 million this quarter. So we're staying on track with what we believe. With regard to the EPS, clearly we don't get into quarterly guidance, but the back half assumes that we expect to have acceleration on that. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thank you, operator. Next question, please? Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette from Bank of America. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great, thanks. Good morning, Jeff, Chris, Josh and Derek. So I know you guys can't talk too much about the terms of these new U.S. distribution deals, but I guess I first have a question is, will a U.S. sale of CEREC through Schein be more profitable to you than what CEREC unit profit margin has been under Patterson previously? And then also is Schein going sell just CEREC in the U.S. for Chairside, CAD/CAM, crown restoration, or are they still going to have the option to sell other Chairside crown restoration systems if they want to? Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Thanks for the question. Again, this is about Schein having our full distributed line. They'll have everything with regard to CAD/CAM as well as our imaging products, our Treatment Centers and our instruments. We're not going to get into margin profile. Obviously, we believe that this structure is in the best interest of both parties and it's about accelerating growth for both of us. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. And the other quick thing, this is more of a comment than really just a question, but I still don't really get the notion of the Patterson's sales force distraction, that they know they're still going to be selling it going forward. You think they'd want to work harder to lock-in sales before a new distributor comes in. I don't understand why they'd lay down in this situation but again that's sort of the sidebar comment I guess I'll look forward to seeing you guys at our conference next week and we can hopefully talk about this in more detail. Thanks. Jeffrey T. Slovin - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Look, again, until you have clarity in the market, it leads to confusion. And you have to understand that, that is the fact. When Patterson on their call in November announced that they would be opening up distribution with it, that brought certain uncertainty for the marketplace. We feel we've dealt with that. I mean, we're very excited with what we've announced today with Patterson as well and we think that will have an impact for us. So both Henry Schein and Patterson, coming together understanding what is going to be exactly what we do moving forward will allow everyone to focus on execution. Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our final question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Vik Chopra - UBS Securities LLC Hey, guys. This is Vik Chopra in for Matt. Thanks for taking my questions and squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the Consumables business, kind of what areas of strength you've seen, maybe specialty versus general products? And what you're seeing in terms of ASPs? And my second question is on gross margins. How should we think about gross margins heading into the rest of year? And can we expect any expansion over last year? Thanks. Christopher T. Clark - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Yeah. Vik, it's Chris. Relative to the Consumables, I mean we have pretty solid and consistent growth really across the various SBUs, if you will, both on the Chairside as well as on the specialties, particularly solid, relative to endo. Again we look pretty solid underlying U.S. sell-through trends which again, we're pleased with. Europe was very solid from a core Consumables standpoint. So again, I think, that we feel good about how that business is executing. There's a number of new innovations that we showed at the IDS. New products really do drive those businesses pretty significantly, which again we're pleased with what we've brought to market. And again I think that relative to the margins or the pricing, again we're able to hold price fine. We're able to take reasonable price generally on these businesses. So again I don't think we see any significant change in those competitive dynamics. Joshua Zable - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Vik, as far as gross margin for the year, we don't get into that level of detail. What I would tell you is that this quarter, margins were impacted by the timing of the merger last year. Remember, last year had the strongest selling month for Sirona, so that gave us a difficult comparison. We talked about margins year-over-year in terms of operating margins to be similar to last year, but that actually implies underlying growth because again, you'll recall that last year we benefited from that strong selling month. So overall, remember gross margins, you have a lot of moving parts in there between product mix and FX. And so we'll just talk about the operating margin level for the year. Operator Thank you. That does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to our moderators for any additional or closing remarks. Derek W. Leckow - DENTSPLY SIRONA, Inc. Well thank you, everyone, for joining us today on today's conference call, and thanks for your interest on Dentsply Sirona. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming conferences and of course, we'll update you again on August. Have a good day. Operator Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

And welcome to PayPal’s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today’s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Gabrielle Rabinovitch Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings’ earnings conference call for the first quarter 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We’re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentaries. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company’s performance. In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma measures because we believe that these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company’s performance across different periods. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2017. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today’s date, April 26, 2017. We disclaim any obligation to update the information. With that, let me turn the call over to Dan. Dan Schulman Thank you, Gabrielle. I’m pleased to report that PayPal began 2017 with an exceptional quarter. This continues a string of consistently strong performance since our separation from eBay in July 2015. We delivered solid operating and financial results this quarter. PayPal gained 6 million net new active accounts, a 35% increase from the 4.5 million net adds in Q1 a year ago. This represents largest organic quarterly increase in this important metric over the past three years. We ended the quarter with 203 million active accounts. We expect that our net adds will increase by more than 20 million in 2017 and once again our transactions per active account increases, growing in Q1 to 32 up from 28 a year ago. We reported $2.975 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis, above the high end of our guidance, driven predominantly by stronger core PayPal growth. PayPal delivered $.44 of non-GAAP EPS, which is $0.02 above the high end of our guidance as we are beginning to realize the sustainable benefits of our scale and we generated $603 million in free cash flow. This strong customer results clearly demonstrate our progress towards becoming the worlds leading open digital payments platform. We continue to build on our strategies of reimagining and democratizing the management and movement of money for our consumers. Helping drive the global transition from cash to digital payments and positioning our millions of merchants to benefit from the noble revolution at move to an all-digital cross-context retail environment. Our powerful two-sided network engages both consumers and merchants and the larger our scale the stronger our network effect becomes. We have made meaningful progress in advancing merchant adoption of PayPal in the quarter. At the end of March the number of active merchant accounts on our platform increased to 16 million. The size of our merchant base is a formidable competitive advantage and is extraordinarily difficult for others to replicate. We have provided one of the new brands at the PayPal platform including online fashion retailer with Vente-Privee in France, Papa John’s and Groupon in U.S., leading Mexican department store chains, Coppel and Liverpool, and we made meaningful strides in the travel and tourism vertical in India with the addition of access rooms, Vista Rooms and MakeMyTrip. In addition, over 5 million merchants and 75% of the IRR 100 now offer our industry-leading One Touch checkout solution on their mobile and desktop shopping experiences. We expect the number of merchants accepting One Touch to increase noticeably throughout the year. We finished the quarter with 53 million consumers opted into One Touch. We couldn’t be more pleased with this transformative product experience and the engagement that’s driving with our customers. One Touch provides a powerful connection between our merchants and our consumers in a mobile first world. In the quarter, 32% of our payment volume came through mobile device and mobile payment volume increased 51% over the same period last year to approximately $32 billion. In the quarter, we also continue to innovate and transform how people send money to each other through P2P and remittent services. We continue to expand the functionality of our global remittent service Xoom. In the quarter we launched the Xoom service within the PayPal mobile app in the U.S. and plan to increase spending limits to $10,000 per transaction in the second quarter. We opened up the Japanese market in Q1 making Xoom now available in 56 different countries around the world. In the quarter Venmo continue to transform our millennials managed and engage with their money. In addition to being named is one of fast company’s most innovative brands, the social P2P app process 6.8 billion in payments in the quarter. This more than double the volume processed year ago. Importantly, beginning in Q2 we plan to significantly enhance the social P2P payment experience that has made Venmo environment phenomenon. PayPal made Venmo available as a payment option on the brand three platform. We have the opportunity to test and learn as preserved unique nature of Venmo as we move the experience into new context. Today we are announcing the opening of our data for select U.S. PayPal merchants who accept Venmo as a mobile payment option. We anticipate the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely deployed across millions of our U.S. PayPal merchant base by the end of this year. Investments we have made in our platform architecture now allow us to enable Venmo as a payment method for our PayPal merchants without any additional integration work on their end, mirroring the approach we use to successfully rollout One Touch. While we continue to drive innovation inside PayPal, we are also always looking to acquire innovative companies that can bring great product experiences and technology talent to PayPal like we delivered entering, Venmo, Paydiant and Xoom. In the first quarter we announced our agreement to acquire Tio Networks which will expand our two-sided network by adding bill payment is another key service to drive engagement and value to our consumers. On April 10th Tio shareholders approved our transaction and we expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2017. Tio is a leading multichannel bill payment processor in North America and processed more than 7 billion in bill payment in its fiscal 2016. The company’s digital platform and physical network of agent location make paying bill simpler, faster and more affordable. And importantly, gift consumers may not have access to digital financial services, the ability to easily migrate cash into a digital network and as a result benefit from the convenience and speed of digital bill payments. With its network of 10,000 supported billers, Tio will meaningfully expand our ability to offer digital financial services to tens of millions of underserved consumers. Reinventing the management and movement of money for people across the global creates opportunities for close partnerships with companies across our ecosystem. We continue to strengthen and forge additional strategic alliances with leading brands around the world. We just announced the partnership agreement with Wells Fargo, adding another strategic issuer to the growing list of companies working with PayPal to expand our services at the point of sale. As a result of this partnership Wells Fargo customers will be able to use their debit and credit cards to make contactless mobile payments at millions in store merchants. This expands our longstanding relationship with Wells Fargo and build on the product capabilities. These are made available to PayPal as part of our strategic partnership. We also extended our partnership with Visa into the Asia-Pacific region and in January we finalized a comprehensive strategic partnership with Discover. Along with Citi and FIS, these partnerships will make it easier for PayPal customers to find and choose the preferred financial instruments inside the PayPal Wallet and use the PayPal account in multiple context. Our conversations with other leading issuers continue to be positive and constructive. Over the past nine months we have rolled out consumer choice against across our on boarding, servicing and checkout experiences. Multiple millions of our consumers have already opted into choice and have formatted the payment option best suited for their particular checkout experience. Consequently, we now have additional visibility into the early results of choice and we are quite pleased that what we are seeing. First, choice is having a notable positive impact on our net active adds. Second, it is driving higher spend per customer. Third, we are experience a reduction across into our customer service centers leading to cost reductions in our global operations. And finally, the impact of choice on our transaction margins is well within our expectations. In summary, we couldn’t happier with our strategic move to choice and the corresponding benefits we are seeing. We plan to rollout choice in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, beginning in Q2. We also announced a meaningful expansion of our growing relationship with Google. PayPal will be available within Android pay in United States and will be accepted as a way to pay both in app and at the millions of retailers that accept Android pay at the point of sale. We are pleased to offer our customers another exciting way to pay with PayPal further expanding the choices and context within which they can use their PayPal Wallet. We expect that our relationships with technology companies like Google and Facebook will continue to grow and expand into additional context as we move through the next several quarters. 2017 continues the strong efforts we have undertaken to create strategic partnerships across multiple ecosystems. We have seen the transformative power of these partnerships across our business. It’s hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across the multiple sectors who were previously viewed as potential competitors. We are now collaborating a strong and supportive allies to create value for our mutual customers. As this quarter’s results clearly demonstrate we are executing against our vision in a disciplined fashion. We operate one of world’s most exciting and dynamic industry which energizes and inspires our entire team. We still have much to accomplish, but I would like to take a moment and thank the entire PayPal team for another quarter of dedication and hard work on behalf of our customers. It is making a real difference in the value we can drive to consumers, merchants and to our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to John. John Rainey Thanks Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal’s customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great year. We outperformed in the first quarter on both revenue and earnings, building on our momentum for 2016. Solid growth across active accounts, payment volumes and revenue demonstrates that our customer first strategy coupled with our strategic partnerships are yielding results. Before I go into the detail financial results, a few highlights for the quarter, revenue was $2.98 billion, growing 17% on a spot basis and 19% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS grew 19% to $0.44. We generated $751 million of operating cash flow and $603 million of free cash flow and we returned $517 million to shareholders during the quarter. For the first quarter, our total payment volume was $99 billion, up 25% on a currency neutral basis, including U.S. payment volume growth of 27% and international volume growth of 23%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $84 billion. Merchant services represent approximately 85% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented approximately 15% of the total compared to 16% in the prior quarter and 18% in the first quarter of 2016. In the first quarter, we added 5 million net new active accounts, ending with 203 million active accounts, representing growth of 11% from Q1 last year. Active account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal core business. The number of payment transactions per active accounts increased 12% year-over-year, continued solid growth of customer engagement in active accounts resulted in a 23% year-over-year increase in payment transactions to $1.7 million.  In the first quarter 17% revenue growth resulted from a 60% in transaction revenue and a 23% increase in revenue from other value added services. Transaction revenue was driven by core PayPal and Braintree businesses and revenue from other value added services was predominantly driven by credit. For Q1 our total take rate was 3% and our transaction take rate was 2.62%, both of these metrics reflect sequentially and down approximately 14 basis points from a year ago. Continuing a trend, our P2P businesses contributed meaningful in take rate decline in the quarter. Again, I would like to point out the growth in our Venmo and our core P2P platform increases our ubiquity, strengthens our value proposition and support higher levels of engagement and reduce levels of churn across our consumer base. These businesses are important to our long-term success and we remain committed to both investing it and monetizing these high growth opportunities. Our volume based expenses were up 28% year-over-year. Transaction expense was $987 million, up 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by increase funding cost across our core PayPal platform, as well as business mix from strong growth in Braintree. On choice we are in the process of rolling this experience to all of our customers here in U.S. and as Dan articulated, we are pleased with the early success of this initiative. To date, the increase card based cost have been well within our expectation. Transaction loss in the quarter was $171 million or 5.7% of revenue, representing 40 basis points of leverage. In the quarter loan losses for both the consumer and merchant credit finance were $129 million or 4.3% of revenue. Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge-off rate was 6.9% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivable balance including both principle and interest of $5.7 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolio and a total reserve of $360 million. Other operating expenses increased 4.5% to $1.05 billion or 35% of total revenue, representing 420 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year. This marks the lowest favored growth in operating expenses that we achieved as an independent company. We are very encouraged by the early progress of our initiatives to operate more efficiently. Looking forward we will continue to seek opportunities to drive sustainable efficiencies and cost discipline, while at the same time foster innovation, reducing complexity in our processes and improving our service to our customers. We are positioning PayPal to operate and scale more profitably over the long-term. Associated with these initiatives we recognize a $14 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, primarily related to strategic headcount reductions across our global organization. Less than 3% of our global work force will be affected and based on current plans we do not expect a net decrease in headcount for the year. We expect to realize annualized savings of approximately $75 million, of that majority of which will be reinvested in our growth initiatives. We believe the changes we are making to how we are organize and how we run the business will allow us to deliver sustainably stronger results. Non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter was 21.6%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the same period last year. This is our best operating margin performance since separation. In addition, non-GAAP operating income grew 20% year-over-year to $643 million, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 in the quarter. I would now like to spend a moment discussing how changes in foreign currency impacted our results in the quarter. While we recognize hedge gains of $40 million in the first quarter, these gains were more than offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. The effect of translation net of our hedge gains created revenue headwind of approximately $16 million. Our hedging program is decided to minimize the operating income effect from changes in the currencies to which we have the largest exposure. On an operating income basis, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates were immaterial to our results in the quarter. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion. We generated $751 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $148 million or 5% of revenue, resulting in $603 million of free cash flow in the quarter, representing $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. In addition to an already strong balance sheet, our balance generates substantial free cash flow. Effective capital allocation is an additional leverage to drive long-term value creation. We take a comprehensive view of our sources and uses of cash to ensure that we allocate resources and capital to what we consider to be the highest return on alternatives. We are fortunate and we have many great options for the use of our free cash flow. Part of that is how we deploy the capital on our balance sheet to highest returning investments. We currently have $5.1 billion of consumer credit receivables on our balance sheet and are exploring different options including asset sales and partnership opportunities to free up cash for higher returning investments. In the first quarter, we returned $517 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $500 million remaining on our buyback authorization further reinforcing our ongoing commitment to capital return and discipline capital allocation. Today we are announcing a new buyback authorization in the amount of $5 billion. We are confident that the cash generated potential of our business will continue to allow us to invest organically, be equatative and return cash to shareholders. We are pleased that we are positioned to increase the repurchase authorization and view this as the next step in providing a more comprehensive longer range plan for capital allocation. Consistent with the execution of our existing authorization we plan to repurchase share to offset the dilution from stock based compensation and use the remainder for opportunistic repurchases. I would now like to discuss our guidance for the second and updated guidance for the full year 2017. For the full year, we are ranging our revenue guidance and now expect revenue between $12.52 billion and $12.72 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 17% to 19%. We are pleased that raising this outlook relative to the guidance that provided in January because of the momentum you are seeing across our business and initiatives. At current exchange rates for the full year we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 200 basis points, resulting in spot growth of 15% to 17%. We are also raising our full year EPS number and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of a $1.74 to $1.79. We expect the sequential trends in our quarterly revenues and earnings to be very similar to 2016. For the second quarter we expect revenue to be between $3.05 billion and $3.1 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.41 and $0.43. In closing we have started 2017 from a position of strength. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, executed successfully across our plans and achieve important goals both operationally and financially. We see substantial opportunity in the markets we are currently serving and those that are part our longer term addressable market. We will continue expand and build on our market leadership position and remain focus on balancing investments in growth with profitability and discipline capital management, creating shareholder value for the long-term. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Darrin Pellar from Barclays. Your line is now open. Darrin Pellar Thanks guys. Thanks John. Just – it’s great to see more operating leverage in the model, just wanted to be clear first, John, the $40 million in restructuring is more one-time nature? And then, perhaps, you can give us a bit more detail moves you are making to improve that operating expense growth, I think, you mentioned, you said 5% in other expense, where can that get you here, I mean, clearly showing more of the past due in operating leverage this quarter than in the past? Thanks. John Rainey Yes. Thanks, Darrin. Good question both. The $40 million restructuring charge is a result of a very targeted initiative here which actually goes into your second quarter that is really design to help us move forward in a very efficient manner as we scale our business. It is not what I would describe as your typical headcount reduction. It’s a target reduction that really drives towards the efficiency of the business and in doing so is in a very customer centric fashion. So we don’t expect that in the future necessarily that’s one-time effect. With respect to operating leverage, you are right, you could go back and look at the last several quarters and you have seen sequential declines in our operating expense growth rate each of those quarters. And to your point we grew 4.5% this quarter and even if you look at that on kind of an incremental margin basis, for every dollar of revenue that we brought in this quarter our operating expenses increased $0.10 and that’s the best performance that we have ever seen as a company. You can go back to prior years and that number would have been as high as $0.50 in some cases. So this is a demonstration of how we are going to operate moving forward and it really is across all aspects of our business. It’s not specific to what you may think of generally as overhead. It’s how build sales group and product development. How we build our product. How we sell to our customer. So it’s a muscle that we are developing and we certainly hope that we can share more of these results going forward. Darrin Pellar All right. Nice job guys. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-tsin Huang Thank you for the results. Just want to ask on the acceleration in active accounts and also in the U.S. payment volume metric looks like acceleration as well, is that the result of the customer choice or there are other factors to consider, just trying to segregate customer choice from the rest of the business if possible? Dan Schulman Yes. Tien-tsin, thanks for the question. I think, there are a couple of things that drove overall results. And I think one of the things is au (3144) around these things. It is the result of cumulative effect of lots of actions that we have been taking. Certainly, customer choice is being very helpful. We are seeing not only increase on board – on boarding is more streamlined but reduction in churn, which to me is a great checkmate for what we were trying to do with the choice. But that’s still early days on that. We are really seeing momentum across all regions right now. I think a lot of that is because over the past 18 to 24 months Bill and his team, the risk teams others around the company have really looked at our core value proposition. Things that you may not think about like availability and performance of our network are up time. We spent a tremendous amount of energy and resource to make sure that our platforms perform the way that our customers expect for us. We obviously couldn’t think like One Touch. One Touch is driving more engagement. More engagement typically means with our churn, which is held for on our net adds. I think, if you look at our noble performance and it’s arguable that we are only not global checkout experience right now. I look at things like our consumer app we put out, the merchant app we put out, new invoicing things, smaller things have the ability to recover passwords more easily, all of these things are starting to hit in the marketplace in quite impactful way. And I would say we are just beginning on this as well. I mean, if you think about choice for the first time, we are actually beginning to see banks that, we have even mentioned in our remarks, our press announcements that our marketing pays off to their consumers because if they can put their debt or credit into the PayPal Wallet, they know they are going to drive additional digital spend by doing that. We have a lot more that we have got planned in the funnel whether that’s additional functionality for Venmo users, whether that’s international expansion, upticks in our consumer value proposition or all of the things we are doing with multiple partners across world, that’s also helping to drive our net adds. So as I mentioned in our remarks, we are now expecting more than 20 million net adds for the year since substantial step up from where we are and hopefully we will continue to see that momentum moving forward. We are certainly encourage by what we are seeing. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane Hey, guys. Solid results. Just kind of a two part question, I guess, what came in better than previous guidance that cause the revenue and EPS guidance raise from fiscal year ’17? And then just secondly on the Android paid partnership announcement, that seems like a unique deal. My understanding is PayPal will generate a fee on all transactions at the point of sell regardless of tender types, so even if it is a credit card. So maybe you can help us understand the economics that PayPal earns on those transactions? Thank so much and congrats on the quarter? Dan Schulman Thanks, Bryan. I will take the first part of the question then turn over to Bill for Android. Actually, Bryan, this is one of these quarters where we just hit on all cylinders. If you start at the top of the funnel you see that the 6 million net new adds, which is highest we have had in several years and then you walk away down, revenue came in and really all – across all regions came in better than what we have expected in core PayPal. And then as I alluded to you in my prepared remarks, we are really pleased with what we are seeing in around discipline on the cost side of the business. We have got – we just -- we are changing our way that we operate as a company and this is Bill’s evolution, but we are pretty excited and then we are beginning to seeing the results of what we are capable up here. Bill Ready Yeah. The Android pace probably just, the thing we are doing there, I mean, it’s good to sort of take a step back a little bit and talk about some of the broader partnership that we are doing, be more specific your question on Android, hey Bryan is, what you are seeing happen on mobile that our two sided platform is allowing to connect consumers and merchants very efficiently across many different context and if you have seen people on ecosystem partner with us because we can help line up new experiences that they want to create for their customers and so that’s across the number of partnerships that we have. With Android Pay and PayPal becoming a payment options inside of Android Pay, number one, we are going to give the consumer great ability to access mobile app to pay transactions by be able to sign up at One Touch to be able to have a friction of on boarding into that experience. We have a great customer journey into mobile app to pay. And then at the end of that the economics of that we are starting with PayPal balance only and for those we will make money on those transactions must like it would any other transaction. As we work through other payment methods we will use Visa, Mastercard tokens, tokens from other and this is one of the interesting things about deals we did there that the token that we import from Visa and Mastercard we – when we token out the estimate of an issuer, we will pass through a card present rates to the merchants, the merchant is card presently, and we only cost on those things. It also means that we are not necessarily have revenue on all those transactions, but we don’t have cost either and that let us have some of our transactions where we will make good margin on those, others basically are zero revenue and zero costs for us and the benefit of that is that we can drive engagement across our consumer base and you see that’s across other parts of our business where take P2P as a good example we did tremendous volume on P2P. And in many situations those are free transactions but those consumer engage with us on P2P are more engaged overall and we find that some of our most profitable customers because we have higher engagement them overall across other transactions where we monetize. And we think about in store in a very similar way, with Android Pay in similar way that we will have some of those transactions that we monetize directly, others that are pass through for us but we expect it will drive overall engagement higher as we have more and more opportunities to engage with our PayPal users. Dan Schulman Yeah. Just to build on that a response though, one of the long-term aspirations we have with consumers is that, we first started this that they were transacting with us one to two times a month. We are now approaching almost three times a month, that’s what we can say it for us that our long-term aspiration is that a PayPal consumer engagement with us one to two times a week. And as Bill mentioned, the way to do that is to be much more involve in the everyday management and movement of money of the consumer, which means that we want to give them this optionality of not only what instrument they want to use and how they want to spend, but where they want to spend. So whether that the international remittance, whether that be bill pay, whether that be a tax to pay in app or in store, we are trying to open up the PayPal Wallet through these partnership in multiple context and multiple different functions for our consumers to be much more engage with PayPal Wallet and we are beginning to see the early payoffs of that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Paul Condra Hey, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I guess, on, just on the guidance, does that include any contribution from Venmo or Tio, just on Tio can you talk a little bit about margin profile, growth rate or anything just to help understand that, the way that business looks a little more? Thanks. John Rainey Sure. As Dan alluded to you in his remarks, we are beginning to expand pay with Venmo and we have got some improvement in the contribution assume there, but I wouldn’t by any stretch the imagination suggested aggressive or that were dependent upon that for our results this year. We are going to be measured in this as Bill has said many times before this is something where we – it’s too precious to get Venmo and we want to get the experience just right. So if that requires us taking more measured approach that’s absolutely fine with us. And so we are – we do expect to have daily improving economics with Venmo as we go forward. But there is not, I wouldn’t describe our 2017 guidance is depending on the comp that is going to happen within that. Dan Schulman Yeah. As I mentioned in my opening remarks on Venmo side, we are really trying to take same approach with One Touch. We have now been able to engineer our platform just like with One Touch recently got such quick merchant acceptance as the merchant have to do no work on their part to be able accept our One Touch transaction. We have that initial on Braintree with automobile customers and we tested Venmo to see I take that experience, that’s a social experience of payments and move it into a social experience for purchases as well. And we now have the platform to be able to turn on PayPal merchants which obviously is the vast majority of base here in the U.S. to accept payment from Venmo as an option. And so that will roll out over the year but that will roll out more towards the back half of the year and so we will Venmo this year and as John said, we will start to see that improve as we look forward in our medium-term guidance. On Tio, Tio is a publicly traded company right now, you can see the results that did about $80 million or so last year in their past quarter, this last quarter that they just reported. Obviously, we will look at with synergies are there. We are quite excited about having Tio come in. Bill payment is a very sticky solution. We are really trying to build out how we can help underserved consumers manage and move their money and that can be done in a very profitable way for us and a very consumer friendly way for consumers as well. So we are really excited to close that acquisition. Again, we expect that to close in the second half of this. But in our overall results, it’s a pretty small number in general. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani Thanks. Dan you mentioned like discussions with other banks continue and you have some good experiences. I guess, what’s holding some other announcements up when you have your discussions with banks? And then, just one for John, as part of the asset life strategy, is there any sense of timing? Thanks. Dan Schulman Yeah. So, Sanjay, just, we are actually announcing all of the different issuers and banks that we are working with, because we don’t active, we don’t -- they don’t necessarily make the announcement. We don’t need the announcement and so there are lot that adjusting to that end. Some of the very big ones take time to work with. That’s really just take time to work through. I think there is a single conversation that we are having right now that I feel, but optimistic about that everything being done with an eye from both parties to get deal done and these are big banks. They have a unique, some of them are very unique situations and we just need to work through large different documents with each of them. We want to make sure that when we sign up with the bank that the product flows are right, that we exactly have experience right to make it as I mentioned in my remarks, mutually advantageous for our mutual customers. So, not really to read on that, just take some time to work through these things. John Rainey Sanjay, on asset life, I want to start by reminding everyone that we have no intention to start offering a credit product. Credit today compliments a holistic suite of payment offerings that we provide for our merchants and consumers and they find great value of that. What we do want to do though is put that that credit offering in a less capital intensive manner than what we do today, so that we can free up that cash potentially as much as $5 billion for higher returning investment. We have got various options there, some are more partnerships like opportunities, others are pure asset sale, some combination of the two. Our preference that you do question on timing is to do something sooner, but we are not going to add on the side of experience that means giving a sale optimal deal for PayPal. So we are not under a self-imposed timeframe. We are going to take our time will be measured and do what is best for creating long-term shareholder value for PayPal. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache Thank you. Good afternoon. Dan, I know you have said that you are pleased with the consumer choice results that you have seen far, but can you give us a little bit more detail around what’s driving your confidence level over being able to continue to offset the increase in transaction margin compression with TPV growth and operating leverage? And John, separately for you, could we see the growth rate and other expenses turn negative for a time or is the goal just to keep other expenses growing more slowly than revenues? Thanks. Dan Schulman Yes. Thanks for your question, Bill. So, I will just take one step back on choice. We want the choice, because we really felt that into our long-term stage to be the ultimate customer champion company focused on customers and what their pain points are, what they need that offering them optionality of how and where they want to pay, giving them flexibility and transparency and powering them with essential for us to remain the market leader in digital payments. And it also had the benefit which was great, enabling us to team with networks, financial institutions, carriers, tech companies to drive digital payment, we are all aligned and wanted to do that. And then remember that the partnership arrangements that we had enabled us to get certain things that we didn’t have before cost certainty, elimination of digital wallet, sees what something that was hanging out in the market, we got access as Bill mentioned to industry standard tokens, card present rates. We have network volume discounts that came back to us because we obviously drive a ton of volume over the various networks and we had instant access to funds coming off of the platform which was a – today which we have in our P2P product and we fill all of those gaps with this field. So we assume right now that we are now rolled out basically into across our on boarding, a servicing and our checkout experiences. And we are not now looking at tens of thousands of data test and after test for hundreds of thousands of early adapters, we are looking at multiple millions of consumers that is opted into choice and the results we are seeing are, a frank and very pleasant as we see them. As I mentioned, we are going to see an increase in net adds and a notable part of that is going to be driven through choice and we are just beginning on that piece of it. Our order sizes are up as people can figure out, so this order allows them to use our debit or credit cards, this transaction they wanted to use their ACH or debit card. And so people can now talk about for in fact nearly it’s those who use PayPal less to finding the most value in choice right now and that is driving engagement and higher order sizes and we see our cost coming down as we expected, because people were confused about funding choices and we expected a reduction of course coming in the call center and that’s exactly what we are seeing and that’s sustainable cost reductions for us. And then the transaction costs are well within the expectation, so we have well within that and so we had model all of these reasonably conservatively what we looked at our guidance and our medium-term guidance and all of them. We are quite pleased by what we are seeing and we are just getting start the marketing for the banks. In fact that we get additional funding options coming in like rewards points that will start to come in early next year as our another funding mechanism, all of these things are sort of begin early days on choice, but we were always sure that over the long-term this would make sense for us, we are frankly see any playing out much earlier than we expected. John Rainey Hey, Bill, the second part of your question, in terms of whether we would expect to see OpEx turn negative. I would reemphasis that this is not a one-time cost take out approach on cost. We are reengineering the way we work and so from one quarter to the next we certainly have seasonality in our business we may invest more in certain quarters versus other quarters, but at the end of day we are growth company and we are going to continue to add cost, where we think it generates value for us. And we don’t overly rotate towards one metric like other operating expense or like transaction margin, the thing that drives us is being a customer champion and create shareholder value and so we are going to make decision whether it would be around revenue or costs that we think results in strong performance in both of those metrics. Dan Schulman I would say, senior leader shifting though, there has been a tremendous amount of focus kind of how we do that in a way that enables us to make decisions quickly, to innovate more rapidly, to do so in a much more efficient way and so when you think about costs, this is not necessarily taking cost out but it’s eliminating cost. So for instant in global ops, our global ops growth least than that that it has come forward. The reason for that is predominantly caller statement. That means calls are not coming in our customer care, because our product experience is better, since we have choice and so those are sustainable benefits that we have as a result of actions we are taking that and we are very focused on being both – focus on what customer pain points are. How we solve it. How we keep our lead in the marketplace that are operating in very efficient and effective way. John Rainey And Bill, I would add to that, maybe a better to think about the cost trajectory going forward with other operating expense is mid-single digits growth. Bill Carcache Great. Thank you both for the very detailed responses. That’s very helpful. Thank you. Dan Schulman You bet. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar Thanks. Hi, Dan, John, Bill. Solid quarter. Congratulations on that. My question is, now we have had obviously a number of initiatives one is consumer choice, you both acquired Xoom, contextual commerce, almost then sort of a kind of design to increase the size of the funnel, you draw more transactions and accounts on to the PayPal platform, you are having good payment now, banking other relationships. I guess, the question becomes, are you done buildings, what you could be building in terms of pulling transactions in, it become an execution story from now on, is that, I mean, what else could you be adding to the platform here strategically? Bill Ready Hi, Ashwin, it’s Bill. One other things we really think a lot about is, how rapidly the consumer is moving into new context with MA transact and the interesting thing about PayPal, we talked about this the previously, it will really make PayPal is that we are one of the only player to operate on both the consumer merchant side of the payment ecosystem. They will do so globally and control the experience end-to-end. And so what that means is that, every time consumer emerge they start to meet one and another in new context or consumers want to transact in the new context. We are able to light those up often times in far better late than what others could. And so on one hand, we – our cost are looking how we evolve the platform to make sure that as those new context emerge that we can serve customers. However, we have a structural difference in our company that naturally allows us to be a primary player, enabling those transactions, because of the way that we operate on both the consumer and merchant side of the payment ecosystem and in fact that we can do so globally and control end-to-end experiences. And I think you see that happening in what’s going on in the ecosystem that you see in terms of mobile commerce, at 32 billion dollars in volume this quarter, more than $100 billion last year and what we are doing with the One Touch rollout and with 5 million plus merchants and 75% IRR 100, you are seeing that increasingly, our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystem are looking at us as the preferred partner to light up these types of experience for them. So your question was around how much we are building, we continue to think on building for those new contexts, but we also have our platform is really set up to be a great way to connect consumers and merchants whenever they meet one another in new context. And then some of those specifically where on the consumer side, Dan, talks a lot about things that we want to do and become a part of the way people manage and move their money every day. Those are places where we are just beginning our endeavors and look at the kind of growth, and Dan touched how we are approaching three transactions a month, while we had great growth overall. We think there is so much more of the consumers overall experience and we can help them with and the industry is moving toward us, that you have seen more and more transactions are moving towards e-commerce and to mobile and we are increasingly a preferred partner to our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystems as that happens. Dan Schulman I just like to add to that, if you think about the merchant side and you think about our strategy around the merchant side, as we move fundamentally over the last three or four years from predominantly being a button on our website to really now being a fundamental underlying platform provider to merchants as they think about how did they take advantage of mobile and that means that we are offering a host of services across a common platform that we never did before. Full checkout type of capabilities, credit capabilities, contextual commerce toolsets, rewards integration through API sets and the list goes on and on and so invoicing capabilities. So if you think about the mission of PayPal of both on the consumer side as Bill just articulated and on the merchant side. It is a much more expansive mission and vision than we have ever had before and so I think that we obviously can grow in a couple of different ways going forward and this is fully what we expect. One is we are going cross sell more products and services to existing customers. We have a whole suite both on the consumer side and on the merchant side and we can tremendously expand the amount of services we provide to each and every customer. Second thing though is we are just beginning on this journey here. We are beginning to see acceleration of our net ads coming consumers are beginning to recognize sort of network effect and we have merchants are beginning to see that and we have huge international expansion opportunities which is better performance and we can do on that side. So it’s not just a matter of due coming in, it’s a matter of taking what we have and be able to cross sell into existing as well. So that sort of combination of this two things, time gives us a lot of excitement about our growth prospect as we look forward. Operator And we have time for one last question from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is now open. James Cakmak Hi. Thanks. Just one quick one, does your guidance contemplate any kind of incremental marketing expense build awareness on the pay with Venmo side as we progress with that. I guess is the look towards at the end of year is what? Dan Schulman Hi, James, thanks for the question. First of all, I think, one of the areas that as we have seen a bunch of fundamental really efficiency and improvement is in our whole marketing spend. We took what we are previously very desperate marketing functions in each of our regions either in headquarters, we put them all together and that group is both regions and I think central looking at our spend, figuring out how do we spend that in the most efficient manner. We have ton of data and analytics around if you look at things both through an ROI perspective and we are not just more efficient but way more effective on our marketing spend and I can’t say enough good things about what that team has done. And by being more efficient we are actually getting more spend out of the existing dollars that we have. With pay Venmo for all of our growth initiatives, you heard John talk about we are going to take the money that we are saving and reinvest it back into our group initiatives, pay with Venmo where we a part of that that gets additional investment for us. John Rainey Yeah. I would just add to that, while, as just Dan mentioned, we have great efficiency around marketing and billing considering the ability to assist, pay within what’s marketing, the $6.8 million a month we did in the quarter and 114% year-over-year growth came with almost no marketing for Venmo. It’s a product that have been inherently viral and so we certainly think about how we will support the product going forward, but it is a great place to be when you have a product that customers truly love and is inherently viral and grows without having to go through tons of marketing dollars added and so that is something we think about with that as we build pay with Venmo the social aspect of that we have kept very much at the core of what we are doing and we think that can really help to build upon the virality of the core product. So it’s not a product that we have to go support with massive amounts of marketing. It’s a product that is inherently viral and that we can complement with couple marketing. James Cakmak Yeah. Great. Dan Schulman So, James, thank you for that question. And thank you to everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks a lot.

[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Darrin Pellar from Barclays. Your line is now open. Darrin Pellar Thanks guys. Thanks John. Just – it’s great to see more operating leverage in the model, just wanted to be clear first, John, the $40 million in restructuring is more one-time nature? And then, perhaps, you can give us a bit more detail moves you are making to improve that operating expense growth, I think, you mentioned, you said 5% in other expense, where can that get you here, I mean, clearly showing more of the past due in operating leverage this quarter than in the past? Thanks. John Rainey Yes. Thanks, Darrin. Good question both. The $40 million restructuring charge is a result of a very targeted initiative here which actually goes into your second quarter that is really design to help us move forward in a very efficient manner as we scale our business. It is not what I would describe as your typical headcount reduction. It’s a target reduction that really drives towards the efficiency of the business and in doing so is in a very customer centric fashion. So we don’t expect that in the future necessarily that’s one-time effect. With respect to operating leverage, you are right, you could go back and look at the last several quarters and you have seen sequential declines in our operating expense growth rate each of those quarters. And to your point we grew 4.5% this quarter and even if you look at that on kind of an incremental margin basis, for every dollar of revenue that we brought in this quarter our operating expenses increased $0.10 and that’s the best performance that we have ever seen as a company. You can go back to prior years and that number would have been as high as $0.50 in some cases. So this is a demonstration of how we are going to operate moving forward and it really is across all aspects of our business. It’s not specific to what you may think of generally as overhead. It’s how build sales group and product development. How we build our product. How we sell to our customer. So it’s a muscle that we are developing and we certainly hope that we can share more of these results going forward. Darrin Pellar All right. Nice job guys. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Tien-tsin Huang Thank you for the results. Just want to ask on the acceleration in active accounts and also in the U.S. payment volume metric looks like acceleration as well, is that the result of the customer choice or there are other factors to consider, just trying to segregate customer choice from the rest of the business if possible? Dan Schulman Yes. Tien-tsin, thanks for the question. I think, there are a couple of things that drove overall results. And I think one of the things is au (3144) around these things. It is the result of cumulative effect of lots of actions that we have been taking. Certainly, customer choice is being very helpful. We are seeing not only increase on board – on boarding is more streamlined but reduction in churn, which to me is a great checkmate for what we were trying to do with the choice. But that’s still early days on that. We are really seeing momentum across all regions right now. I think a lot of that is because over the past 18 to 24 months Bill and his team, the risk teams others around the company have really looked at our core value proposition. Things that you may not think about like availability and performance of our network are up time. We spent a tremendous amount of energy and resource to make sure that our platforms perform the way that our customers expect for us. We obviously couldn’t think like One Touch. One Touch is driving more engagement. More engagement typically means with our churn, which is held for on our net adds. I think, if you look at our noble performance and it’s arguable that we are only not global checkout experience right now. I look at things like our consumer app we put out, the merchant app we put out, new invoicing things, smaller things have the ability to recover passwords more easily, all of these things are starting to hit in the marketplace in quite impactful way. And I would say we are just beginning on this as well. I mean, if you think about choice for the first time, we are actually beginning to see banks that, we have even mentioned in our remarks, our press announcements that our marketing pays off to their consumers because if they can put their debt or credit into the PayPal Wallet, they know they are going to drive additional digital spend by doing that. We have a lot more that we have got planned in the funnel whether that’s additional functionality for Venmo users, whether that’s international expansion, upticks in our consumer value proposition or all of the things we are doing with multiple partners across world, that’s also helping to drive our net adds. So as I mentioned in our remarks, we are now expecting more than 20 million net adds for the year since substantial step up from where we are and hopefully we will continue to see that momentum moving forward. We are certainly encourage by what we are seeing. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Bryan Keane Hey, guys. Solid results. Just kind of a two part question, I guess, what came in better than previous guidance that cause the revenue and EPS guidance raise from fiscal year ’17? And then just secondly on the Android paid partnership announcement, that seems like a unique deal. My understanding is PayPal will generate a fee on all transactions at the point of sell regardless of tender types, so even if it is a credit card. So maybe you can help us understand the economics that PayPal earns on those transactions? Thank so much and congrats on the quarter? Dan Schulman Thanks, Bryan. I will take the first part of the question then turn over to Bill for Android. Actually, Bryan, this is one of these quarters where we just hit on all cylinders. If you start at the top of the funnel you see that the 6 million net new adds, which is highest we have had in several years and then you walk away down, revenue came in and really all – across all regions came in better than what we have expected in core PayPal. And then as I alluded to you in my prepared remarks, we are really pleased with what we are seeing in around discipline on the cost side of the business. We have got – we just -- we are changing our way that we operate as a company and this is Bill’s evolution, but we are pretty excited and then we are beginning to seeing the results of what we are capable up here. Bill Ready Yeah. The Android pace probably just, the thing we are doing there, I mean, it’s good to sort of take a step back a little bit and talk about some of the broader partnership that we are doing, be more specific your question on Android, hey Bryan is, what you are seeing happen on mobile that our two sided platform is allowing to connect consumers and merchants very efficiently across many different context and if you have seen people on ecosystem partner with us because we can help line up new experiences that they want to create for their customers and so that’s across the number of partnerships that we have. With Android Pay and PayPal becoming a payment options inside of Android Pay, number one, we are going to give the consumer great ability to access mobile app to pay transactions by be able to sign up at One Touch to be able to have a friction of on boarding into that experience. We have a great customer journey into mobile app to pay. And then at the end of that the economics of that we are starting with PayPal balance only and for those we will make money on those transactions must like it would any other transaction. As we work through other payment methods we will use Visa, Mastercard tokens, tokens from other and this is one of the interesting things about deals we did there that the token that we import from Visa and Mastercard we – when we token out the estimate of an issuer, we will pass through a card present rates to the merchants, the merchant is card presently, and we only cost on those things. It also means that we are not necessarily have revenue on all those transactions, but we don’t have cost either and that let us have some of our transactions where we will make good margin on those, others basically are zero revenue and zero costs for us and the benefit of that is that we can drive engagement across our consumer base and you see that’s across other parts of our business where take P2P as a good example we did tremendous volume on P2P. And in many situations those are free transactions but those consumer engage with us on P2P are more engaged overall and we find that some of our most profitable customers because we have higher engagement them overall across other transactions where we monetize. And we think about in store in a very similar way, with Android Pay in similar way that we will have some of those transactions that we monetize directly, others that are pass through for us but we expect it will drive overall engagement higher as we have more and more opportunities to engage with our PayPal users. Dan Schulman Yeah. Just to build on that a response though, one of the long-term aspirations we have with consumers is that, we first started this that they were transacting with us one to two times a month. We are now approaching almost three times a month, that’s what we can say it for us that our long-term aspiration is that a PayPal consumer engagement with us one to two times a week. And as Bill mentioned, the way to do that is to be much more involve in the everyday management and movement of money of the consumer, which means that we want to give them this optionality of not only what instrument they want to use and how they want to spend, but where they want to spend. So whether that the international remittance, whether that be bill pay, whether that be a tax to pay in app or in store, we are trying to open up the PayPal Wallet through these partnership in multiple context and multiple different functions for our consumers to be much more engage with PayPal Wallet and we are beginning to see the early payoffs of that. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Paul Condra Hey, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I guess, on, just on the guidance, does that include any contribution from Venmo or Tio, just on Tio can you talk a little bit about margin profile, growth rate or anything just to help understand that, the way that business looks a little more? Thanks. John Rainey Sure. As Dan alluded to you in his remarks, we are beginning to expand pay with Venmo and we have got some improvement in the contribution assume there, but I wouldn’t by any stretch the imagination suggested aggressive or that were dependent upon that for our results this year. We are going to be measured in this as Bill has said many times before this is something where we – it’s too precious to get Venmo and we want to get the experience just right. So if that requires us taking more measured approach that’s absolutely fine with us. And so we are – we do expect to have daily improving economics with Venmo as we go forward. But there is not, I wouldn’t describe our 2017 guidance is depending on the comp that is going to happen within that. Dan Schulman Yeah. As I mentioned in my opening remarks on Venmo side, we are really trying to take same approach with One Touch. We have now been able to engineer our platform just like with One Touch recently got such quick merchant acceptance as the merchant have to do no work on their part to be able accept our One Touch transaction. We have that initial on Braintree with automobile customers and we tested Venmo to see I take that experience, that’s a social experience of payments and move it into a social experience for purchases as well. And we now have the platform to be able to turn on PayPal merchants which obviously is the vast majority of base here in the U.S. to accept payment from Venmo as an option. And so that will roll out over the year but that will roll out more towards the back half of the year and so we will Venmo this year and as John said, we will start to see that improve as we look forward in our medium-term guidance. On Tio, Tio is a publicly traded company right now, you can see the results that did about $80 million or so last year in their past quarter, this last quarter that they just reported. Obviously, we will look at with synergies are there. We are quite excited about having Tio come in. Bill payment is a very sticky solution. We are really trying to build out how we can help underserved consumers manage and move their money and that can be done in a very profitable way for us and a very consumer friendly way for consumers as well. So we are really excited to close that acquisition. Again, we expect that to close in the second half of this. But in our overall results, it’s a pretty small number in general. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open. Sanjay Sakhrani Thanks. Dan you mentioned like discussions with other banks continue and you have some good experiences. I guess, what’s holding some other announcements up when you have your discussions with banks? And then, just one for John, as part of the asset life strategy, is there any sense of timing? Thanks. Dan Schulman Yeah. So, Sanjay, just, we are actually announcing all of the different issuers and banks that we are working with, because we don’t active, we don’t -- they don’t necessarily make the announcement. We don’t need the announcement and so there are lot that adjusting to that end. Some of the very big ones take time to work with. That’s really just take time to work through. I think there is a single conversation that we are having right now that I feel, but optimistic about that everything being done with an eye from both parties to get deal done and these are big banks. They have a unique, some of them are very unique situations and we just need to work through large different documents with each of them. We want to make sure that when we sign up with the bank that the product flows are right, that we exactly have experience right to make it as I mentioned in my remarks, mutually advantageous for our mutual customers. So, not really to read on that, just take some time to work through these things. John Rainey Sanjay, on asset life, I want to start by reminding everyone that we have no intention to start offering a credit product. Credit today compliments a holistic suite of payment offerings that we provide for our merchants and consumers and they find great value of that. What we do want to do though is put that that credit offering in a less capital intensive manner than what we do today, so that we can free up that cash potentially as much as $5 billion for higher returning investment. We have got various options there, some are more partnerships like opportunities, others are pure asset sale, some combination of the two. Our preference that you do question on timing is to do something sooner, but we are not going to add on the side of experience that means giving a sale optimal deal for PayPal. So we are not under a self-imposed timeframe. We are going to take our time will be measured and do what is best for creating long-term shareholder value for PayPal. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is now open. Bill Carcache Thank you. Good afternoon. Dan, I know you have said that you are pleased with the consumer choice results that you have seen far, but can you give us a little bit more detail around what’s driving your confidence level over being able to continue to offset the increase in transaction margin compression with TPV growth and operating leverage? And John, separately for you, could we see the growth rate and other expenses turn negative for a time or is the goal just to keep other expenses growing more slowly than revenues? Thanks. Dan Schulman Yes. Thanks for your question, Bill. So, I will just take one step back on choice. We want the choice, because we really felt that into our long-term stage to be the ultimate customer champion company focused on customers and what their pain points are, what they need that offering them optionality of how and where they want to pay, giving them flexibility and transparency and powering them with essential for us to remain the market leader in digital payments. And it also had the benefit which was great, enabling us to team with networks, financial institutions, carriers, tech companies to drive digital payment, we are all aligned and wanted to do that. And then remember that the partnership arrangements that we had enabled us to get certain things that we didn’t have before cost certainty, elimination of digital wallet, sees what something that was hanging out in the market, we got access as Bill mentioned to industry standard tokens, card present rates. We have network volume discounts that came back to us because we obviously drive a ton of volume over the various networks and we had instant access to funds coming off of the platform which was a – today which we have in our P2P product and we fill all of those gaps with this field. So we assume right now that we are now rolled out basically into across our on boarding, a servicing and our checkout experiences. And we are not now looking at tens of thousands of data test and after test for hundreds of thousands of early adapters, we are looking at multiple millions of consumers that is opted into choice and the results we are seeing are, a frank and very pleasant as we see them. As I mentioned, we are going to see an increase in net adds and a notable part of that is going to be driven through choice and we are just beginning on that piece of it. Our order sizes are up as people can figure out, so this order allows them to use our debit or credit cards, this transaction they wanted to use their ACH or debit card. And so people can now talk about for in fact nearly it’s those who use PayPal less to finding the most value in choice right now and that is driving engagement and higher order sizes and we see our cost coming down as we expected, because people were confused about funding choices and we expected a reduction of course coming in the call center and that’s exactly what we are seeing and that’s sustainable cost reductions for us. And then the transaction costs are well within the expectation, so we have well within that and so we had model all of these reasonably conservatively what we looked at our guidance and our medium-term guidance and all of them. We are quite pleased by what we are seeing and we are just getting start the marketing for the banks. In fact that we get additional funding options coming in like rewards points that will start to come in early next year as our another funding mechanism, all of these things are sort of begin early days on choice, but we were always sure that over the long-term this would make sense for us, we are frankly see any playing out much earlier than we expected. John Rainey Hey, Bill, the second part of your question, in terms of whether we would expect to see OpEx turn negative. I would reemphasis that this is not a one-time cost take out approach on cost. We are reengineering the way we work and so from one quarter to the next we certainly have seasonality in our business we may invest more in certain quarters versus other quarters, but at the end of day we are growth company and we are going to continue to add cost, where we think it generates value for us. And we don’t overly rotate towards one metric like other operating expense or like transaction margin, the thing that drives us is being a customer champion and create shareholder value and so we are going to make decision whether it would be around revenue or costs that we think results in strong performance in both of those metrics. Dan Schulman I would say, senior leader shifting though, there has been a tremendous amount of focus kind of how we do that in a way that enables us to make decisions quickly, to innovate more rapidly, to do so in a much more efficient way and so when you think about costs, this is not necessarily taking cost out but it’s eliminating cost. So for instant in global ops, our global ops growth least than that that it has come forward. The reason for that is predominantly caller statement. That means calls are not coming in our customer care, because our product experience is better, since we have choice and so those are sustainable benefits that we have as a result of actions we are taking that and we are very focused on being both – focus on what customer pain points are. How we solve it. How we keep our lead in the marketplace that are operating in very efficient and effective way. John Rainey And Bill, I would add to that, maybe a better to think about the cost trajectory going forward with other operating expense is mid-single digits growth. Bill Carcache Great. Thank you both for the very detailed responses. That’s very helpful. Thank you. Dan Schulman You bet. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open. Ashwin Shirvaikar Thanks. Hi, Dan, John, Bill. Solid quarter. Congratulations on that. My question is, now we have had obviously a number of initiatives one is consumer choice, you both acquired Xoom, contextual commerce, almost then sort of a kind of design to increase the size of the funnel, you draw more transactions and accounts on to the PayPal platform, you are having good payment now, banking other relationships. I guess, the question becomes, are you done buildings, what you could be building in terms of pulling transactions in, it become an execution story from now on, is that, I mean, what else could you be adding to the platform here strategically? Bill Ready Hi, Ashwin, it’s Bill. One other things we really think a lot about is, how rapidly the consumer is moving into new context with MA transact and the interesting thing about PayPal, we talked about this the previously, it will really make PayPal is that we are one of the only player to operate on both the consumer merchant side of the payment ecosystem. They will do so globally and control the experience end-to-end. And so what that means is that, every time consumer emerge they start to meet one and another in new context or consumers want to transact in the new context. We are able to light those up often times in far better late than what others could. And so on one hand, we – our cost are looking how we evolve the platform to make sure that as those new context emerge that we can serve customers. However, we have a structural difference in our company that naturally allows us to be a primary player, enabling those transactions, because of the way that we operate on both the consumer and merchant side of the payment ecosystem and in fact that we can do so globally and control end-to-end experiences. And I think you see that happening in what’s going on in the ecosystem that you see in terms of mobile commerce, at 32 billion dollars in volume this quarter, more than $100 billion last year and what we are doing with the One Touch rollout and with 5 million plus merchants and 75% IRR 100, you are seeing that increasingly, our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystem are looking at us as the preferred partner to light up these types of experience for them. So your question was around how much we are building, we continue to think on building for those new contexts, but we also have our platform is really set up to be a great way to connect consumers and merchants whenever they meet one another in new context. And then some of those specifically where on the consumer side, Dan, talks a lot about things that we want to do and become a part of the way people manage and move their money every day. Those are places where we are just beginning our endeavors and look at the kind of growth, and Dan touched how we are approaching three transactions a month, while we had great growth overall. We think there is so much more of the consumers overall experience and we can help them with and the industry is moving toward us, that you have seen more and more transactions are moving towards e-commerce and to mobile and we are increasingly a preferred partner to our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystems as that happens. Dan Schulman I just like to add to that, if you think about the merchant side and you think about our strategy around the merchant side, as we move fundamentally over the last three or four years from predominantly being a button on our website to really now being a fundamental underlying platform provider to merchants as they think about how did they take advantage of mobile and that means that we are offering a host of services across a common platform that we never did before. Full checkout type of capabilities, credit capabilities, contextual commerce toolsets, rewards integration through API sets and the list goes on and on and so invoicing capabilities. So if you think about the mission of PayPal of both on the consumer side as Bill just articulated and on the merchant side. It is a much more expansive mission and vision than we have ever had before and so I think that we obviously can grow in a couple of different ways going forward and this is fully what we expect. One is we are going cross sell more products and services to existing customers. We have a whole suite both on the consumer side and on the merchant side and we can tremendously expand the amount of services we provide to each and every customer. Second thing though is we are just beginning on this journey here. We are beginning to see acceleration of our net ads coming consumers are beginning to recognize sort of network effect and we have merchants are beginning to see that and we have huge international expansion opportunities which is better performance and we can do on that side. So it’s not just a matter of due coming in, it’s a matter of taking what we have and be able to cross sell into existing as well. So that sort of combination of this two things, time gives us a lot of excitement about our growth prospect as we look forward. Operator And we have time for one last question from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is now open. James Cakmak Hi. Thanks. Just one quick one, does your guidance contemplate any kind of incremental marketing expense build awareness on the pay with Venmo side as we progress with that. I guess is the look towards at the end of year is what? Dan Schulman Hi, James, thanks for the question. First of all, I think, one of the areas that as we have seen a bunch of fundamental really efficiency and improvement is in our whole marketing spend. We took what we are previously very desperate marketing functions in each of our regions either in headquarters, we put them all together and that group is both regions and I think central looking at our spend, figuring out how do we spend that in the most efficient manner. We have ton of data and analytics around if you look at things both through an ROI perspective and we are not just more efficient but way more effective on our marketing spend and I can’t say enough good things about what that team has done. And by being more efficient we are actually getting more spend out of the existing dollars that we have. With pay Venmo for all of our growth initiatives, you heard John talk about we are going to take the money that we are saving and reinvest it back into our group initiatives, pay with Venmo where we a part of that that gets additional investment for us. John Rainey Yeah. I would just add to that, while, as just Dan mentioned, we have great efficiency around marketing and billing considering the ability to assist, pay within what’s marketing, the $6.8 million a month we did in the quarter and 114% year-over-year growth came with almost no marketing for Venmo. It’s a product that have been inherently viral and so we certainly think about how we will support the product going forward, but it is a great place to be when you have a product that customers truly love and is inherently viral and grows without having to go through tons of marketing dollars added and so that is something we think about with that as we build pay with Venmo the social aspect of that we have kept very much at the core of what we are doing and we think that can really help to build upon the virality of the core product. So it’s not a product that we have to go support with massive amounts of marketing. It’s a product that is inherently viral and that we can complement with couple marketing. James Cakmak Yeah. Great. Dan Schulman So, James, thank you for that question. And thank you to everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks a lot.

Onward Choi Thank you, Brandi. I would like to start by providing opening remarks on behalf of William. As a reminder all percentages are based on RMB. 2017 is off to a strong start and our ability to successfully develop and this should be in the weight of content continues to be the cornerstone for our growth. Mobile has taken hold as the dominant force in the online community and we are actively cultivating our mobile reach across our business to extend and then its brand to users not only in China but around the world. During the first quarter we advanced a number of strategic initiatives in each of our core divisions, increasing out total net revenues by approximately 72.3% year-over-year; and 12.7% quarter-over-quarter. Specifically we introduced multiple new mobile games and added new expansion packs to our popular PC client games. We also enhanced our monetization capabilities for our advertising services and expanded our e-commerce business. Led by our self-developed mobile games the year-over-year increase of net revenues from our online game services was 78.5%. Net revenues from our advertising services and email, e-commerce and all other segments were also up by 15.2% and 63.2% respectively or compared to the same period last year. Our mobile games continue to make greater contributions to our online games revenues. In the first quarter mobile games accounted for approximately 73% of our total online games net revenues, up from about 64% in the preceding quarter, as well as the first quarter of 2016. We released a number of new mobile titles in the first quarter including well received games such as Demon Seals Mobile, Westward Journey Rage, and Land of Glory [ph], an epic 3D Westward fantasy real-time MMORPG. Hit titles like Onmyoji continue to gain popularity with multiple content updates for us in the first quarter, and on February 20, 2017, it achieved 200 million global downloads. Other legacy mobile titles including Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey online mobile games, Invincible, Heroes of Tang Dynasty Mobile and the mobile versions of New Ghost, as well as the PC-client games such as New Ghost and Fantasy Westward Journey online also maintained good user attractions during the period. We are also pleased to be expanding our global lattice [ph] when NetEase operated games are being widely embraced. In February, we released Onmyoji in Japan following a Southeast Asia release base last year. And we plan to continue our global rollout of this game this year with Korea, Canada, Europe, and the U.S. as the next destinations. We have the similar international aspirations with other self-developed games such as Land of Glory. Popular games that we operate in China are also enriching the domestic online games market. In particular, the closed beta tapping for my craft [ph] where it is launched in April is progressing well and we are on-track with the official launch planned for later this year. Additionally, for the first quarter Blizzard Entertainment's Hostel achieved record number of quarterly attributes and players are flocking to the games, U.S. expansion pack, journey to Ngoro [ph] launched last month. A central theme to our game strategy is glow where is market settlements while simultaneously attracting users to our legacy titles. We have to enrich pipeline lineup for 2017 with a number of mobile games under development. You shrink them and diversify our portfolio that includes more than 100 Titles. In April we released several new mobile titles to buzz reviewer as a feedback including Treasure Hunter, a catalyst style PPS game or third-party shooting games. We plenty to do more detailed pipeline information for the rest of the year as the latest game, New Press Conference on May 20, 2017 in Guangzhou. With our PC-Client Games, we launched new expansion packs for New Ghosts and Kung Fu Master II recently, and plan to introduce new expansion packs for several popular games in the coming months including Tianxia III, Heroes of Tang Dynasty Zero, Demon Seals, Revelations, and New Westward Journey Online II. The advertising and e-commerce markets are also core components of our growth. During the first quarter, the automobile, real estate and telecommunications strategies were our top performing verticals with our year-over-year gains driven by strong growth in mobile media supported by our top rank mobile news app. Additionally both Kaola.com and Yanxuan are rising with promising growth trajectories. Our focus remains on creating premium contents for and reaching the imaginations of our massive community in online games, media and e-commerce. It is this ideas and strategies that support our ability to maintain our commitments to our shareholders, increase our products and expand our company across its lines. This concludes Williams's comments. I will now provide a review of our first quarter 2017 financial results and primarily focus on margins, expense fluctuations and net profit. Our gross profit for the first quarter was RMB7.5 billion or $1.1 billion, compared to RMB6.5 billion and RMB4.6 billion for the preceding quarter and first quarter 2016, respectively. The year-over-year increase in online games gross profit was primarily driven by increased revenue contributions from mobile games such as Onmyoji, the mobile versions of New Ghost, and Demon Seals Mobile, as well as Blizzard Entertainment's Overwatch, and World of Warcraft. The quarter-over-quarter increase in online game gross profit was primarily driven by revenue contribution from mobile games such as Onmyoji, the mobile versions of New Ghost, and Demon Seals Mobile. Quarter-over-quarter we saw a decrease in advertising services gross profit which was primarily due to seasonality. The year-over-year increase in e-mail, e-commerce and other gross profit was primarily due to increased revenue contributions from our e-commerce business, such as Kaola.com. The quarter-over-quarter decrease was primarily due to lower revenue contributions from certain e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margins. First quarter gross profit margins for online games was 63.9% compared to 60.7%, and 67.1% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter 2016, respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to increase in revenue contributions from mobile games, which have relatively lower gross profit margins as a percentage of our total online games net revenues. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to decreased revenue contributions from license games which have relatively lower gross profit margins and one-off recognitions of certain royalty expenses related to licensed games in the fourth quarter 2016 and possibly offset by the increase of revenue contributions from mobile games in the current quarter. First quarter gross profit margins for the advertising services business was 57.3%, compared to 66.5% and 62.4% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016 respectively. The year-over-year decrease in gross profit margin was mainly due to higher stock related and content purchase cost and the quarter-over-quarter decrease was mainly due to seasonality.

The year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter decreases were primarily attributable to decreased of revenue contributions from certain e-commerce businesses with relatively higher gross profit margin. Total operating expenses for the first quarter were RMB2.7 million or $394 million compared to RMB2.6 billion and RMB1.7 billion for the preceding quarter, and the first quarter 2016 respectively. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher selling and marketing expenses related to online games, high R&D investments and higher stock related costs, as well as operating expenses related to kaola.com. The quarter-over-quarter increase was mainly due to higher stock related costs. During the first quarter we recorded in net tax charge of RMB943.0 million or US$137.0 million, compared to RMB882.0 million and RMB530.7 million for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2017 was 19.0%, compared to 19.2% and 17.5% for the preceding quarter and the first quarter of 2016, respectively.

Thank you for your attentions, we would like now to open the call to your questions, operator please go ahead. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Fan Liu with Goldman Sachs. Fan Liu Hi management, thanks for taking my question. So your differed revenues this quarter has declined by 8% quarter-over-quarter, would you mind to guide the reason behind that and also do you mind to share with us, what is your company strategy to prolong a life longevity of the 16 titles this year, and what's your plan of the new product pipeline the second half? And also do you want to guide with us what's revenue a contribution on Kaola and Yanxuan this quarter? And also any color on the margin profile will be also appreciated. Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So basically with regard to your questions about how the company's plans to maintain the longevities of the game products, it depends on the strategies that we are adopting, basically you can make reference to what we have been doing especially on the PC games front. I would like to see game titles such as FWJ and WJ, you see that we have accumulated quite a good experiences and the knowledge about how to maintain a long life cycles for various game titles that we have operated for long. And in a way you can also observe that through so many years, we have also been able to up keep a very stable and perhaps a growing performance for those like the legacy titles and a couple other game titles that we have put in place in the market. And we would definitely be making good use of those experiences that we have accumulated over the years as well as adopting similar strategies for moving on to our mobile price and we believe that those experiences would be very helpful to enabling us to make sure that the same thing what happens on our mobile price. And on the other hand, we are also looking upon the fact that NetEase is a company very strong in delivering high qualities and premium game products in the marketplace and we believe that by offering those good quality game products to the marketplace. This can also enhance the overall gaming experiences to our players or the gamers in general. And so we believe that this will also be another positive points that we would like to share with you. And on color of that we have also got very solid plans to roll out a couple of new quality and premium games to the market in the future periods. And so basically what Williams would like to share with you a bunch of how we think about and our strategies to ensure the continuity of the game products. And now getting back to your questions and more on the financial sides of the operations, I believe that in the first quarter and this is obvious that if you look at it different revenues, on a Q - on-Q comparison there has been this growth of about 8% but we do will that this is still a very understandable and yes and also not a way a significant decrease in terms of the program is because if you look back in especially in the last quarter because we already got it where high pace in the four quarters and in the first quarter of 2017 there's also been a quarter with not too many new games been go out. And so it's obvious, that's still quite within our expectations and we're still feeling that all of our game titles are still being good and most of them are still upkeeping, very stable performance at the same time as and when we are rolling out some more new contact updates on your special pack where we are also expecting that there would be a positive impact that brought about to the overall performances of our various other game titles in the marketplace. And so far to answer your third questions about the revenue contributions of Kaola businesses in our business segments which is the e-mail, e-Commerce and others. We'll start giving you to the exact percentage. I would say that in the first quarters of 2017 our e-commerce related businesses including both the Kaola and also our Yanxuan already accounts way race and the components of our overall revenue contributions in our first segments namely are the email commercial harvest. Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Alicia Yap of CitiGroup. Alicia Yap Hi. Thank you. Good morning, William and Onward. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats under strong quarter. My question is related to the recent fluctuations of - is it mainly due to more intensified competition from other new games or is that more related to MOG on operation effort and what would be the team currently are working on to improve and overturn the fluctuations of the game. And then second question is related to our activation recently on the conference call. They note that they saw about 30% year-over-year increase in the item sale for World of Warcraft and Overwatch. Do you see the similar type of growth rate for the China franchise for this year? Any color for that will be appreciated. Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So basically first of all with regard to your first questions of - definitely we also see kind of some fluctuations in terms of the performance but after all we still believe that the game by itself is a very successful mobile games and we have a very strong teams and high quality products being roll out to the market. And at the same time we are holding a very confidence, performance going forward because in terms of both the depth and the breath of the context that we are offering for these particular games. This is also still a very good and we have lots to offer in the times to come. And so we believe that our this game will be still be performing well in the future. And on the other hand, with regards though to how we move about the lighter games performances in particular to all the games that we have in lightens from Blizzard Entertainments not only including the World of Warcraft, Overwatch but also extending to the upper three and also to cross stones and some other games as well. And one of the highlights that we would like to share with you is that the last week it happens on the strong net cash, all those games has also made another record high performances in terms of the matrix that has been very encouraging to us. And we are looking over the five offerings of some very quality products to the market. We still believe that this can also ensure a good experience has been conferred upon our players. And this can also ensure a long term performance of the games in the times to come. Operator Thank you. You are next question comes from Natalie Wu with CICC. Natalie Wu Hi, good morning, William, Onward and Juliet. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on another solid quarter. And also thanks all for the support in the past years and financial apex wishes for you and for the future endeavor. So my question is about the. PC games. So I've noticed that there is some kind of the softness regarding the self-develop PC game last year. So just wondering is it an issue to be worried about because you know the PC game industry seems to be already sophisticated in China and cannibalization is taking place; if Natty is confident to maintain their healthy development of PC game business given your solid game operation experience. I just want to hear about management views on that. Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So with regard to your questions about the company's will on busy game developments, basically we do believe that the user has been given to the PC games, players cannot be fully replaced by just playing the mobile games in some ways; and in particular, especially for our licensed games that we licensed from places like the Overwatch, we have also been offering this game free to play to all the users; and in fact, in the last week we have also been seeing that the games has also been averaging another record high that has been very encouraging to us. And in a much longer term, in terms of its market potentials we still believe that the PC game still got this opportunities in the future periods but of course, if you are talking about how we view about its growth potential, of course this would have been able to compare the rest of it with what the mobile games can be offered. But after all, we always believe that for some outstanding products, both in terms of its qualities of the gameplay that defines the content that we operate and of course how we are giving out the - where you need user experiences when playing the games to our pocket uses we believe that this would be the areas that can offer the opportunities to further develop, especially in the PC-client area. And after all we always believe that the innovations and their abilities to create some new stops would be also very crucial to ensure a much long-term success of the company, not only in the [indiscernible] but also companies in the whole gaming industry. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi Okay. Another supplements that William would like to add in this year we would also be planning to roll out two more new PC games in the market and in a way this can also reflecting in ways we are still looking good upon the potentials about the PC game developments going forward. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst Hi Onward and William, I have two questions. The first one is related to your game revenue like deferred revenue. Deferred revenue appears in the balance sheet pretty often, and a lot of investors and also I myself felt little bit confused about how you record your game revenue and how much of growth revenue will be recorded in the current quarter? How much - what percentage of that will be in the deferred; so that is one of the major questions. So I have a second question, in the seasonality Q1 is supposed to be the lower season for e-commerce but to your e-commerce - since it has an up-quarter - and I wonder what's the driver behind it? [Foreign Language] William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So first of all, maybe I just get back to your questions about how we view about the seasonality issues surrounding or you can respect in particular - in the first quarter. First of all, the main parts of it would be good things from the Kaola businesses; and as you may well aware of this would be focusing on the overseas market and also depends on the prototypes that we are being selected and being offered to our targeted customers in the China market. And of course, more of the products will be women focused and we believe that the relatively good performances are on our e-commerce business in the first quarters can be attributed to the fact that we have also been doing quite numbers of promotional stuff during the period and we have also been doing a little bit more acting campaigns to promote the overall business, that can also bring up a positive impact to the overall performance for the e-commerce in the first quarter. And with regard to your second questions about the deferred revenue and stuff like that. I believe that we have always been reiterating that we have a standard policy in order to amortize the revenues of our various gaming products for a period of not more than six months and we have been following it all the way through in a consistent manner. And basically we wouldn't be able to give you an exact percentages on how much of it will be recorded in the deferred revenues and how much would be in the revenues that we recognize but we have - would be doing it on an overall basis, and also whether it's from different game titles. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jialong Shi with Nomura Securities. Jialong Shi [Foreign Language] Actually I have three questions for the management. My first question is about Minecraft, I just wonder what is Minecraft potential monetization models in China and also I want to - I would like the management to share any colors on the revenue potential for this game in China. My second question is about Overwatch, management mentioned earlier, Overwatch was made of - was many free since May 1 this year; I just wonder if Overwatch may have some other revenue source such as from the sales of virtual items? And my last question is about the quarterly dividend; and the company has made natives as - you know, has 25% dividend payout ratio. Currently I just wonder if company - if management may consider raising the quarterly dividend payout ratio? Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So getting back to your question, in general about the Minecraft, basically in China there wouldn't be any company sales as what the overseas markets has been doing. In fact the Minecraft that will be launched would adopting the free to play model and the current timelines that we're expecting to launch this game would be somewhere around the July timeframe. And on your second question about the Overwatch, basically we would be adopting a strategy as to offering free to play to the users during the period from May 1 till the end of May, which is May 31. But subject to the reveal after how the market would be reacting to this kind of arrangements [indiscernible] we would be extending it to a much longer period. And with regards to the monetization models or the business models that we are looking upon for the Overwatch product, basically this would still be adopting the sales software, virtual items within the games. And with regard to your third question about the dividend policies; I would say that for now the companies will still be quite happy with its current dividend payout ratios but of course the companies and the board would be regularly reviewing the overall situations and consider all potential changes whether we are talking about the further increases in terms of its dividend ratios in the future periods but for now we would still upkeep the current payout ratios at approximately 25%. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eddie Leung with Merrill Lynch. Eddie Leung Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick up follow-up question on Minecraft. I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts with us on the target user sentiment of Minecraft? How is it going to be different than the current Chinese user base? [Foreign Language] William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So with regard to your questions about how we look upon the Minecraft, especially the [indiscernible] it would happen in China. First of all, I will like to share with you about some statistics, some preferred track records in the past couple of years that the two of the most popular games in the markets; the number one would be Tetris and the second one would be Minecraft; and in some ways we also observed that in terms of this search index of searching the Minecraft games, this would got a - more than double search that the number one games. And so far as the game is concerned about its launch and the operations in the China market. Basically we would be adopting a different models from the rest of the world because in China we would be offering that game free of charge to play for the players and we are also looking upon that with the many new contests and features that we are offerings within these games, the rollout of the Minecraft in China would also be another successful one that we are expecting. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question comes from Hillman Chan with Macquarie. Hillman Chan Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my questions. Regarding Minecraft, could you say more about the PC beta testing articulates from that? And also could you talk about a timeline for the mobile version of Minecraft in China? And my other question would be about the e-commerce business; I noticed that we have been being aggressive in Kaola, for example, going to Europe for big orders and also the Yanxuan is also very aggressive in China [ph] as well. Just wondering if you can share more on the growth, how long are the GMP target for this year in possible? In the longer term, mostly the margin poll that we should be expecting from the e-commerce business? Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So basically with regard to the PC beta testing, we are feeling very happy with this performance so far and everything has been progressing well. And in terms of when we have reached to mobile versions of the Minecraft, the competitive stage would be somewhere around July of the year. [Foreign Language] William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So basically we would like to share with you about how we will about our strategies or the executions on our e-commerce businesses, especially on the Kaola and the Yanxuan front. For the Kaola, basically the reasons that are - that news would be getting into these new businesses is coming from three years before when the Chinese government has already opened the e-commerce businesses or in fact the cross body e-commerce businesses to all the entrepreneurs in the China market and we are making good use of this policy support in order to move into this new area. And in fact there has been a slogan stuff we have always been talking about when we are undertaking the current businesses because we are importing some of its products but the prices that we are offering would be just local price; meaning that we are targeting and aiming to giving a very good value for money to our targeting customers when they are buying some quantity products from the opposite market. And so far as the Europe market is concerned, of course we have our own merchandising departments out there and we are also in close partnership with some formerly [indiscernible] and in Japan, we are also in close collaborations with Karl [ph] in order to offer some of the more popular items to our targeted customers. And on the other hand, when we look upon to how we are moving to another area of doing the e-commerce businesses like the Yanxuan because we have been seeing that and there has been a very good demand from the local markets for some good quality products in the marketplace and - but many of the times, especially past, the people would be just doing it - the product is obvious been produced locally but when they just placed the brand name from some over the market spend, the price will be very expensive but what we have been doing is that we are doing it by collaborating with the manufacturers locally for some premium product or the brand names; and then we'll be just given the money to buy out certain defined because basically for Yanxuan, the models that we've been adopting would be ODI model. And there would be two things that we would like to offer as to our targeted customers. First of all, quality products and those would be something that they are actually - would like to have; and on the other hand, we are offering say very good price. And so far as the overall populations in China is concerned because by now China has already surpassed more than 1.3 billion people in China, and this definitely would be a very huge market. And we do believe that in the future periods that there would be a certain consumption upgrade and we are also confident and also feeling proud that we would be one of the leading players in the e-commerce area, especially on the Yanxuan fronts by offering a very good quality product but at a very cheap or very effective price to our targeted customers. And also in terms of the user experiences because we are also adopting a very renown and reputable logistic service provider like [indiscernible] and we have also been getting a very positive feedback from our customers so far. Operator So that concludes today's question answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks.

Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst Hi Onward and William, I have two questions. The first one is related to your game revenue like deferred revenue. Deferred revenue appears in the balance sheet pretty often, and a lot of investors and also I myself felt little bit confused about how you record your game revenue and how much of growth revenue will be recorded in the current quarter? How much - what percentage of that will be in the deferred; so that is one of the major questions. So I have a second question, in the seasonality Q1 is supposed to be the lower season for e-commerce but to your e-commerce - since it has an up-quarter - and I wonder what's the driver behind it? [Foreign Language] William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So first of all, maybe I just get back to your questions about how we view about the seasonality issues surrounding or you can respect in particular - in the first quarter. First of all, the main parts of it would be good things from the Kaola businesses; and as you may well aware of this would be focusing on the overseas market and also depends on the prototypes that we are being selected and being offered to our targeted customers in the China market. And of course, more of the products will be women focused and we believe that the relatively good performances are on our e-commerce business in the first quarters can be attributed to the fact that we have also been doing quite numbers of promotional stuff during the period and we have also been doing a little bit more acting campaigns to promote the overall business, that can also bring up a positive impact to the overall performance for the e-commerce in the first quarter. And with regard to your second questions about the deferred revenue and stuff like that. I believe that we have always been reiterating that we have a standard policy in order to amortize the revenues of our various gaming products for a period of not more than six months and we have been following it all the way through in a consistent manner. And basically we wouldn't be able to give you an exact percentages on how much of it will be recorded in the deferred revenues and how much would be in the revenues that we recognize but we have - would be doing it on an overall basis, and also whether it's from different game titles. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jialong Shi with Nomura Securities. Jialong Shi [Foreign Language] Actually I have three questions for the management. My first question is about Minecraft, I just wonder what is Minecraft potential monetization models in China and also I want to - I would like the management to share any colors on the revenue potential for this game in China. My second question is about Overwatch, management mentioned earlier, Overwatch was made of - was many free since May 1 this year; I just wonder if Overwatch may have some other revenue source such as from the sales of virtual items? And my last question is about the quarterly dividend; and the company has made natives as - you know, has 25% dividend payout ratio. Currently I just wonder if company - if management may consider raising the quarterly dividend payout ratio? Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So getting back to your question, in general about the Minecraft, basically in China there wouldn't be any company sales as what the overseas markets has been doing. In fact the Minecraft that will be launched would adopting the free to play model and the current timelines that we're expecting to launch this game would be somewhere around the July timeframe. And on your second question about the Overwatch, basically we would be adopting a strategy as to offering free to play to the users during the period from May 1 till the end of May, which is May 31. But subject to the reveal after how the market would be reacting to this kind of arrangements [indiscernible] we would be extending it to a much longer period. And with regards to the monetization models or the business models that we are looking upon for the Overwatch product, basically this would still be adopting the sales software, virtual items within the games. And with regard to your third question about the dividend policies; I would say that for now the companies will still be quite happy with its current dividend payout ratios but of course the companies and the board would be regularly reviewing the overall situations and consider all potential changes whether we are talking about the further increases in terms of its dividend ratios in the future periods but for now we would still upkeep the current payout ratios at approximately 25%. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Eddie Leung with Merrill Lynch. Eddie Leung Thank you for taking my questions. Just a quick up follow-up question on Minecraft. I'm wondering if you could share your thoughts with us on the target user sentiment of Minecraft? How is it going to be different than the current Chinese user base? [Foreign Language] William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So with regard to your questions about how we look upon the Minecraft, especially the [indiscernible] it would happen in China. First of all, I will like to share with you about some statistics, some preferred track records in the past couple of years that the two of the most popular games in the markets; the number one would be Tetris and the second one would be Minecraft; and in some ways we also observed that in terms of this search index of searching the Minecraft games, this would got a - more than double search that the number one games. And so far as the game is concerned about its launch and the operations in the China market. Basically we would be adopting a different models from the rest of the world because in China we would be offering that game free of charge to play for the players and we are also looking upon that with the many new contests and features that we are offerings within these games, the rollout of the Minecraft in China would also be another successful one that we are expecting. Operator Thank you. We'll take our next question comes from Hillman Chan with Macquarie. Hillman Chan Good morning, management. Thank you for taking my questions. Regarding Minecraft, could you say more about the PC beta testing articulates from that? And also could you talk about a timeline for the mobile version of Minecraft in China? And my other question would be about the e-commerce business; I noticed that we have been being aggressive in Kaola, for example, going to Europe for big orders and also the Yanxuan is also very aggressive in China [ph] as well. Just wondering if you can share more on the growth, how long are the GMP target for this year in possible? In the longer term, mostly the margin poll that we should be expecting from the e-commerce business? Thank you. William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So basically with regard to the PC beta testing, we are feeling very happy with this performance so far and everything has been progressing well. And in terms of when we have reached to mobile versions of the Minecraft, the competitive stage would be somewhere around July of the year. [Foreign Language] William Ding [Foreign Language] Onward Choi So basically we would like to share with you about how we will about our strategies or the executions on our e-commerce businesses, especially on the Kaola and the Yanxuan front. For the Kaola, basically the reasons that are - that news would be getting into these new businesses is coming from three years before when the Chinese government has already opened the e-commerce businesses or in fact the cross body e-commerce businesses to all the entrepreneurs in the China market and we are making good use of this policy support in order to move into this new area. And in fact there has been a slogan stuff we have always been talking about when we are undertaking the current businesses because we are importing some of its products but the prices that we are offering would be just local price; meaning that we are targeting and aiming to giving a very good value for money to our targeting customers when they are buying some quantity products from the opposite market. And so far as the Europe market is concerned, of course we have our own merchandising departments out there and we are also in close partnership with some formerly [indiscernible] and in Japan, we are also in close collaborations with Karl [ph] in order to offer some of the more popular items to our targeted customers. And on the other hand, when we look upon to how we are moving to another area of doing the e-commerce businesses like the Yanxuan because we have been seeing that and there has been a very good demand from the local markets for some good quality products in the marketplace and - but many of the times, especially past, the people would be just doing it - the product is obvious been produced locally but when they just placed the brand name from some over the market spend, the price will be very expensive but what we have been doing is that we are doing it by collaborating with the manufacturers locally for some premium product or the brand names; and then we'll be just given the money to buy out certain defined because basically for Yanxuan, the models that we've been adopting would be ODI model. And there would be two things that we would like to offer as to our targeted customers. First of all, quality products and those would be something that they are actually - would like to have; and on the other hand, we are offering say very good price. And so far as the overall populations in China is concerned because by now China has already surpassed more than 1.3 billion people in China, and this definitely would be a very huge market. And we do believe that in the future periods that there would be a certain consumption upgrade and we are also confident and also feeling proud that we would be one of the leading players in the e-commerce area, especially on the Yanxuan fronts by offering a very good quality product but at a very cheap or very effective price to our targeted customers. And also in terms of the user experiences because we are also adopting a very renown and reputable logistic service provider like [indiscernible] and we have also been getting a very positive feedback from our customers so far. Operator So that concludes today's question answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Brandi Piacente Thank you once again for joining us today.

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dan Florness. Dan Florness Good morning, everybody and thank you for taking time today to listen to our first quarter earnings call. You will note two meaningful changes to our method of reporting from prior quarters, and I attribute that to our CFO and our Chief Accounting Officer, really challenging the format which we convey the information. You will find a much more abbreviated earnings release document and then something new as we have a short slide deck to supplement the earnings call to help some of the talking points, I hope you find it useful. My comments are going to primarily center on the first two pages of commentary which I believe are pages 3 & 4 in the book, if you’re looking at those pages. Earlier this morning, and this is typical with every quarter end. At 7 this morning, central time, I had a call with our regional leaders and our national leaders, talk a bit about the quarter, give them some insight, a little bit about what we’re going to cover on the call, but really just give some insight on the quarter. I want to touch on a couple of points that were mentioned in that call and will dig into the slide deck. The first one and for those of you that have covered Fastenal for any period of time, you know that we are a sales-centered organization and growth-centered organization. That’s been our D&A for 50 years and 2017 does mark our 50th year in business. The first one centers on establishing goals and hitting goals. In the first quarter of 2017, we came in at roughly 101% of goal, 100.7% is the exact number, but roughly a 101% of goal. And we hit or exceeded goal every month of the first quarter. I mentioned that because part of growth is a mindset and attitude and I think we have a great mindset and a great attitude of going forward of serving our customers at a high level and challenging each other to grow and grow every day, every month, every quarter, and so very pleased with that. The second item that I thought was noteworthy is, if you look across our 2,400 store locations, our 400 plus outside locations, look at our business in general. You always have customers that are going through different aspects in their business cycle. We might be growing handsomely with that customer because we are picking up market share. We might be growing nicely with that customer because their business is expanding or we might be contracting with that customer because their business is contracting, and that is true if every one of our stores; so in any given month, a percentage of our stores grow and a percentage of our stores don’t. In the first quarter, over 60% of our stores, about 62% of our stores grew. The last time we did better than that, it was in the first quarter of 2015, and I cite that because as we transitioned from the first quarter of 2015 to the second quarter of 2015, the oil and gas market of which we had a meaningful presence collapsed in North America, collapsed globally, collapsed in North America and our business suffered as a result. So, it’s good to see us start participating from a store-to-store perspective in growth in a way we did before the oil and gas business dramatically slowed. Getting on to the flip book here, first item mentioned, demand gains drove daily sales growth of 6%, 6.2% annually, again, our fastest growth since the first quarter of ’15, so that my earlier comments go hand in hand. Our fastener sales, which are really indicators of the economy in all honesty, have struggled ever since the second quarter of 2015, and that business grew -- returned to growth in the first quarter and that business represents over a third of our revenue, about 36% to 37%. Our non-fastener business grew at 9.5% and in the month of March grew almost 12%, so double-digit growth. So, very pleased with the trends in our business as it relates to both aspects of Fastenal fasteners and non-fasteners. Our pre-tax earnings grew 5.5%, it's the fastest rate of growth for us since the second quarter of ’15. We achieved 20 basis points of operating expense leverage, and one thing about our business is, we have a tremendous amount of incentive comp, a tremendous amount of investments we make periodically in our business. In 2015, we made dramatic investments, and as the economy weakened late in the year, we pulled those investments back. In 2016, it was a lot of about riding the ship, lowering some operating expenses, improving some operating expenses to set us up into’17 and ’18 and beyond. I am pleased by the fact that we had 20 basis points of operating expense leverage, when you consider the fact that incentive comp, which was an historically low number in 2016 expanded nicely in the first quarter. But our incentive comp expands as our gross profit dollars and our earnings dollars grow, and so it expanded nicely, and that ate into some of it. And our profit sharing contribution that goes to our employees in general expanded nicely from Q1 to Q1. Despite those natural headwinds, we obtained operating expense leverage. Very strong cash flow, first quarter is always strong for us as it for everybody in our industry because of the absence of a large tax payment, but very pleased with it. Our capital spending is at a lower level as we’ve talked about on our first quarter call -- or excuse me, our January call, and we didn’t have the CSP 16 investment driving our inventory increase. In fact, if you remove the acquisition we did during the quarter from December to March, our inventory essentially held flat. Speaking of acquisition, on the last year of the quarter, we closed our acquisition of Manufacturers Supply Company or Mansco. It's about a $50 million distributor, so for the next 12 months, we’ll enjoy about an extra point of growth from this acquisition. Flipping on to our growth driver update on Page 2, some things I think are noteworthy. We’ve got to a nice start on our onsite signs. We've signed 64 in the first quarter. We currently have 437 active onsite locations at a 51% increase from the 289 we had at the end of last year. And our goal remains to sign 275 to 300 onsite this year. That's a huge goal. Last year, we signed 176, which was more than doubling of the year before where we had signed 80. We also signed 5,437 vending units, a 17% increase from first quarter of last year. I didn’t go back and look at in detail, but it was either the early part of 2013 or during 2012, when vending initially exploded for us from the standpoint of we really gained traction. It's probably the last time we’ve signed over 5,000 vending devices in the quarter, so very-very pleased with our start to the year. Our goal is to sign 22,000 to 24,000 for the year and very pleased with that. Probably the only challenge we had is, every year there is a certain number of machines that we pull out and that we pulled out some machines in the first quarter. But again very good traction as we enter the year and the sales to product to our vending machines grew double digits again. National accounts grew over 9% during the quarter. We've talked in previous quarters about sales to our top 100 customers, 64 of our top on hundred customers grew with us, so that helped our national account number. Probably the one challenge point that I see when I look at that is, if our -- if national accounts represent roughly half of our business and our business grew at 6% and national accounts grew at 9%, it means the other half our business is growing in the low single digits, 3% or so. That's a challenge and you see that challenge shine through a little bit on our gross margin. The one positive in that though is, as we exit the quarter that group of local other customers change from growing around 3% to 5.5%, so nice way to finish the quarter. And one of the things that driving that number up a bit is the CSP investment we've made last year and that group of products are growing about 10.5% in the first quarter. With that, I’ll turn it over to Holden. Holden Lewis Great, thank you and good morning. Before jumping into the quarterly results, I do want to remind the listeners that as Dan said, we closed the acquisition of Mansco on March 31st, so what this means is our first quarter income statement is not going to reflect any of Mansco's revenues or cost, but our balance sheet will include the assumed working capital and asset. So bare that in mind and we’ll call out when necessary when we’re removing that information. But flipping over now to Slide 5, as Dan has covered our Slide 3, our total and daily sales in the first quarter of 2017 were up 6.2%, that’s a nice acceleration from up 2.7% in the fourth quarter. We do estimate that the benefit of the shift of Good Friday from March into April this year was about 50 basis point benefit to the quarter, but regardless even adjusting for this, the first quarter was the strongest that we’ve seen in the last two years. And frankly that’s strengthening was evidenced through the quarter with March finishing up 8.4%, now that does probably include about 100 to 150 basis points benefit from holiday timing in the month end particular, but again we just continue to see acceleration during the period. On Page 5 of the presentation, first the point is that the backdrop against which we’re operating, it really did continue to improve in the quarter. The Purchasing Managers' Index in the U.S. which still represents 88% of our revenue that averaged and improved to a pretty healthy reading of 57 in the period. Industrial production returned to growth with an even stronger showing from key subcomponents like primary metal, fabricated metal and machinery areas that are more pertinent to our business. And this broadening of industrial demand was reflected by the fact that as Dan alluded to the significantly greater number of our stores were actually growing in the first quarter relative to the 53% to 54% pace that had been set through 2016. This general improvement showed up in other metrics that we track. Again, our Fastenal line returned to growth, finishing up 0.8% in the quarter. Growth at our largest customers as reflected by the national accounts accelerated to be up 9% in the quarter and that included up 11.5% in March. Growth among our manufacturing customers accelerated to be up 6.4% and our construction customers also returned to solid growth being up 4% in the quarter. The tone from the regional vice presidents mirrored these improvements. here remains a great deal of enthusiasm around oil and gas, and during the quarter the outlook for the general manufacturing space and the construction space also improved even as the quarter we're on. The only laggard we could see would be manufacturing that’s going into transportation markets, things like heavy duty truck, rail et cetera. But other than that, frankly on the hold customer demand strengthened and broadened throughout the quarter and we remain encouraged about the near-term trend. Now flipping over to Slide 6, our gross margin was 49.4% in the first quarter which is down 40 basis points versus the first quarter last year. Now, we’ve discussed before the ramifications of the relative growth in our non- Fastenal and large customer mix in the short and intermediate term, and that dynamic probably explains about 30 basis points of the declining gross margin this quarter. The remaining drag can be attributed to a couple of things. First, net freight expense remained a challenge in the first quarter. That said, I do want to know that the freight revenue actually rose on an annual basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2015. On top of that, while the freight expense is a challenge, we did see the overall expense improved in the first quarter relative to where we were in the fourth quarter and the third quarter of last year. So, again that was an impact on our gross margin, but we saw some signs in improvement there. Secondly, we did incur some cost in the period related to an inventory tracking initiatives that we have in some of our non-U.S. markets. These two things were partly offset by growth in the sales and margin of our Fastenal brands product, but collectively if you take the impacts of these latter items, they were relatively modest. And frankly if we ignore mix and just look at our Fastenal and non-Fastenal lines, margins were actually stable to slightly higher in the period. As it relates to pricing, there was not any meaningful impact from that source in the first quarter. Now, our operating margin was 20.3% in the first quarter, that’s down 10 basis points on a year-over-year basis. But again given that our gross margin was down 40 basis points, frankly we believe our organization has done a really nice job leveraging operating expenses in the period. I am looking at a couple of numbers to make the point. Employee related expenses were up 3.7%. This is well below sales growth, not despite the increase in bonus comps that Dan referred to, and it's a result of our being to grow our revenues with a 1.7% decline in our FTE headcount. I know we did add almost 200 new employees in the first quarter over the fourth and frankly if demand remains strong, we would expect that headcount to keep rising. However, we are committed to be disciplined with the headcount and continuing to leverage this line. Occupancy related expenses were only up 1.2% in the quarter, that we had a 140 net store closures since the first quarter of last year and that includes 23 this quarter, and that results in the flattening of the store occupancy expense. The modest increase in cost then is mostly attributable to vending growth. The higher selling transportation related expenses were influenced by really with the 23% to 24% increase in the price of diesel and unleaded fuel in the period versus last year. The incremental margin in the first quarter was 18.5%; however, we had been able to -- we’ve been able to hold the gross margin steady. This would have been well north of 20%, and we continue to believe that assuming a stable growth margin we can achieve 20% to 25% incremental margins at low-to mid-single-digit growth and 25% plus incremental margins at mid-to high-single-digit growth in 2017. Flipping to Slide 7, we generated 210 million in operating cash in the first quarter. Now, first quarters are seasonally stronger as the period tax is not due into April, but by any measure this was a record for any quarter. The amount also represents a 156.8% of the quarter’s net income which is above last year’s 131.9. Better earnings contributed as is working capital, which I’ll address in a moment. The net CapEx was 19.1 million and that’s down 34% on lower spending on CSP 16 and DC Automation. As a result, our first quarter free cash flow was 191 million, up nearly 39%. We used the proceeds to pay 93 million in dividends. We obviously acquired Mansco and we still were able to low our debt in the period by 25 million to 365 million at the end of Q1. Our debt to total capital at the end of the quarter was 15.6%, modestly below the 16.9% a year ago and 16.8% in the fourth quarter of ’16. We view our balance sheet as conservatively capitalized with ample liquidity to continue investing in our business and pay our dividend. In terms of the working capital, we are really comfortable with where the numbers came out. Receivables growth, if you exclude Mansco, was up about 6.5% in the quarter. And now, it's consistent with the growth in sales. Inventory, if you exclude Mansco, was up almost 3% in the first quarter, but it was flattish sequentially. And this reflects the absence of last year’s heavy CSP-related inventory investment. It also reflects though just greater productivity from our distribution center, and I think more energy enterprise-wide focusing on this line. Payables, if you exclude Mansco, were down about 19%. Last year’s payables reflected the aggressive inventory investment we’re making for CSP 16. So, we had an easy comp there. The second quarter of 2017 should have seasonally lower operating cash flow, but better earnings in the absence of CSP spending suggest good cash flow for the full year. Similarly, we continue to anticipate lower CapEx in 2017 of approximately $120 million due to less spending on the DC Automation and the leased lockers. That’s all we have for our formal presentation. And with that, we’ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey First of all, Holden, I think you said that gross margin within the fasteners and the non-fasteners were each higher, but the mix was the thing that drove that 30 basis points of the gross margin degradation. Did I catch that right? Holden Lewis That’s correct. If you look at just fasteners and non-fasteners without considering sort of the mix of those, you had margins that were slightly higher in both cases. David Manthey Great. Okay. So, as it relates to gross margins, two questions here. First, I’m wondering if you can help us understand the range of gross margin from sort of highest product to lowest and not to get specific on what those percentages are. But just that we understand the delta between the high and the low, and I’m thinking sort of the 80/20 rule here, products you sell everyday, not manufactured or modified products, but y just sort of general products available for sale. Could you just help us understand what the difference is between the high and the low? And then the second part of the question is, you mentioned that if you can keep the gross margin flat, you can get to 25% plus contribution margin. Assuming that this mix shift is going on is pretty much of secular trend given your growth initiative. If you’re able to keep gross margin flat, what would be the mechanism that would get you there that you haven't been able to achieve over the past several years? Dan Florness I’m going to chime in and help Holden with that question just given my years. First off, David, if you've know from the prior conversations, range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on -- are you selling something that’s a relatively low value, a convenience pack time or something in our store that it is, I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item to -- I’m basically brokering a transaction and I am getting paid a fee for brokering and I am buying a palette of this product or something. So, I mean the ranges can be from the teens to 80%. I mean, if you really want to get crazy with it, but if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid 30s to the low 60s. And our fastener product line runs in the 50s, our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s. And that kind of gives you some semblance of it, and you can see that play out when you’re looking at a lot of our competitors and where their gross margins are in relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I throw into that would be the fact that, in our industry we're a little bit unique in that we have one of the lowest cost structures for freight. And we all sell our product line that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal and as structural advantages, we have for years to come. If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that mix shift. And I think it’s just that, we’ll be able to offset a piece of that overtime because we’ve talked about our onsite strategy. And what that means, just like we talked about our vending strategy or we talked about our non-fastener strategy 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time lowered our gross margin and the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing, and one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs, and those are things we’ve done very effectively over the last 20 years. Third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings. And so, it’s really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business, but over time maybe narrow some of those brands. The other one is having a strategy for exclusive brands. Today in the non-fastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don’t see a reason why that can't be closer to 30 at some point in time. So continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces, and you can bring the cost savings to your customer and improve your gross margin at the same time. David Manthey It’s helpful Dan. Thank you and best of luck over the next 50 years. Operator  Our next question comes from the line Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Ryan Merkel So I’m going to follow up on Dave’s question. I guess, well I was sort of wondering, you mentioned that mix was a 30 basis point year-over-year headwind. So, should we assume that that continues for the rest of the year or is there something that you’re thinking about that could lessen that impact? Holden Lewis I think given where our mix is going, I think you can look to us several years to probably have a headwind like that. I mean our growth drivers when you think about onsite and safety and vending and things like that, I mean, they lend themselves to that. So, do I think that given where we’re seeing our growth, that that is a reality each quarter of this year, it is. Now, as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better -- to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brands are something we talk about a lot. I called out the freight a little bit, because again while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better and hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we’ll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that that more structural decline if you will. So, I think the answer is, yes. The structural mix is you were certainly there, but we think that we have means by wish to dig into that, if you will and improve. Also bear in mind that, we’re coming into the Q1 gross margin, when we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter. Some of that reflected the fact of the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period and we went and listed a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was, fourth quarter of ’16 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically, what fourth quarters typically do against third? So, I spotted that -- I’m sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically, what Q4 typically looks like against Q3? It’s been more like a 60 basis points decline. And last quarter, we called out we didn’t deleverage the trucking network as much as the historically perhaps have, and we had a number of other things that were small individually, but added up they just went our way. So, I think a better way to think about the quarter -- about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays our versus the prior year Q3. We were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3. And historically, we’re down a couple of 20 basis points or so again the proceeding five years. So, we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter, but we feel like we’re making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, where we don’t view this as a de-gradation in our margin picture by any means. I'll just add a couple of thoughts to that. So fourth quarter -- or excuse me, third quarter we were at 49.3%. Here in the first quarter, we’re at 49.4%. I always look at fourth quarter is being noisy, whether it's up or down. The other thing is, if you look at our the $60 million in growth we’ve had in the last 12 months, 50% of that came from either onsite or vending. And so, there is a certain weighting that goes in there and we need to be executing better every day to offset the piece of that waiting. When I look at the margin in the first quarter, the only thing that I'm troubled by is, there is about 10 to 15 basis points in there that I find just personally frustrating, but, I think we’re executing quite a lot. Ryan Merkel Okay. That’s helpful. So, few things go your way, your framework for 25% to 30% incremental margins at mid single-digit, high single-digit growth that still profitable for this year, but you do need to freight and you probably need mix helping you a little bit. Is that fair? Dan Florness Well, I mean next two quarters, our comps change quite dramatically because we still were a relative -- if you think what's going on in 2015 and near the part of the 2016. We were getting traction on the onsite model. We were correcting some, getting some traction and fixing some things and some customers were improving from the standpoint of our vending model. So, if you think the growth has been occurring in the last 12 months and how that compares to the components of our business that were there in the 12 months prior to that, Q1 of 2016 is kind of that one of those half -- last high water marks and again, every year I ignore Q4, whether it’s a good or bad number that settle things in fix and much of anything. So, yes, the commentary around the incremental margins is really to try to make a point that we believe from an operating expense standpoint that we deleverage of those lines, and that’s despite the fact that we are -- as we grow, obviously we have that shock absorber effect coming from incentive comp and that sort of thing. But the points about the sort of the leverage, those incremental margins is, we feel that we can continue to leverage those lines and we did a nice job leveraging those lines in Q1, and we think that we’ll continue to do a good job leveraging those lines. And yes, if the gross margins cooperate then we do have some easier gross margins to compare against in Q2 to Q3. But, if the gross margins are stable then we think that we can get the kind of incremental margins that we spoken about. Operator  Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham Obviously, a little bit more on this operating leverage. So, if you were to sort of sketch out, how you generate operating leverage, gross income versus your O&A expenses? Is there a way to look at this with sales, whether your sales where for it is and where the trends are going, mid to high single. Does that give you -- is that more of a gross margin thing leverage or SG&A and then sort of a higher level or let’s say low to mid single? Does that switch between those two lines? Could you kind of maybe sketch out how you look at that? Holden Lewis So, again, the guidance that we’ve sort of given on that is, if we hold gross margin stable then we think that we can get those types of incremental margins, just by leveraging the SG&A as we grow. So, when we envision discussing those incremental margin levels, I mean that really talked about leveraging our SG&A more so than the gross profit. And again, we saw some good signs of that, we talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost standpoint. But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenues nicely on slightly lower activity. Those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get, but the discussion that we’ve had was really wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and intending to hold gross margin flat. So, if we can achieve significant improvements in our gross margin, I think that that’s additive but again that’s working against the structural mix that we’re talking about. Scott Graham Yes, I guess I get that holding, but where I guess where I am confirmed on this is that, if you’re putting more stuff in a box, we’re putting more boxes in the truck. There should be gross margin leverage on that too, right? Holden Lewis Well, that would be the leverage on the freight side in that year, you're having better utilization. First off, we have really excellent utilization of our trucking network to-date and so, it's not so much about you putting more boxes into a truck, it's -- those boxes you’re putting into the truck. What customer are they going to? What’s the nature of the business? You know, if it’s a box or an item that’s going to vending machine and it’s a safety product, it's going to have a different margin profile than if it's a box of fastener that’s going to an MRO user. And so, it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remember is as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there maybe pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product. Scott Graham Okay, got you. And then follow-up question essentially is on share repurchases. Is there a point in time? Is there, I’m sure if you worked this carefully through an ROIC analysis and all that. Is there some type of trigger for share repurchase in ’17 that you envision? Holden Lewis I will spend on that one. We have no trigger price as this will buyback or we won’t buyback. That's a conversation we have with our Board on regular basis, we have not been in the market for some time. Historically, we have preferred to use our excess cash from the perspective of investing in the business, investing in our growth and if in case were we’re not drilling enough to use up all the cash generate because the cash we generate is quite attractive. History has said, the bulk of that cash, we return to our shareholders in the form of dividend and that’s just the way we structurally had it overtime. Our dividend release went out last evening has a good 10-year history to give you a perspective on that. No secret anyway in this call, our stock periods and then attractive multiple. And the periods where you’ve seen it, we’ve had some periods with a multiple fell off and we took some excess cash where we took some -- we incurred some borrowings to buy back some stock. But we focus our energy -- we really focus on time and energy on growing the business long term because we think that’s in the best interest of our shareholder. And in the short term, we return a fair part among the cash through a dividend. If you then recall that, I mean last year we had the leased locker program show up which is not something that so expected to begin the year and our first priority is to use our resources to be able to grow. And so we had a very nice quarter in Q1 by any measure. Q2 won’t be as high and we use some of those resources to acquire great company and… Dan Florness I'd say Q2 won’t be slightly come up with cash. Holden Lewis In terms of the cash, correct, relative to earnings, just because of the double tax payments. But in Q1 we use the resources to buy great company and as a result our leverage is based in the same area that it has been for some time, and at this point we prefer to kind of look for other opportunities internally to spend -- to spend our resources on and like we did last year you never know when they’re going to come up. So that remains a priority and what we are looking for. Operator Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy Holden, just one housekeeping item, which I am holding, I think we discussed, but just on Page 10 of your well-applauded new slide deck, you have the new benchmark out and just to remind, I think myself and investors, this is a new benchmark, the one you've published, right, that's going to be taking into account the five year average from ‘12 to ‘16 as opposed from a ‘11 to ‘15. Is that correct? Holden Lewis That’s correct and last year’s documents, we had two benchmarks that we were referring to. One was sort of our historic way of looking at it, which looked at most years from 1998 and then other one was sort of the five year average that last year would have included 2011 to 2015. As the calendar rolls forward so did our five year average into 2012 to 2016, and that’s where we are focusing on now for a benchmark. Robert McCarthy Perfect. Okay. Just want to make sure people saw that. Now just in terms of on the fastener side of the house, what’s your expectation for could you review and I do apologize, if you already kind of walk through this. Your expectations for what you saw for price in the quarter in terms of growth and then what are your expectations for the balance of year in terms of what we can see in place on the fastener side of the house? Holden Lewis Right. So, pricing was not a meaningful factor in the quarter. Price is something that we just continue to review at this point. Now, we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases. Many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charts where prices for metals are clearly up. So, it’s hard to conclude anything other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary, that has been quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners and that means it takes a while for cost to hit our COGS. And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing, and if you remember last year there was a time or two where we thought pricing could occur and then it wound up not materializing for probably demand reasons. And so, it’s nice to be able to get that sort of look, if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it’s going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe, we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market. And the answer is that, we think that we can, but we do have some time to evaluate at this point. Robert McCarthy I mean just looking at the math whether be any way to those price actions say the inflation did well attractive in this context for the balance of the year. Do you think, you could overcome the mix headwind in the gross margins? Will that math work or not? Holden Lewis Oh, in the short-term? Yes, surely. Robert McCarthy Yes. So, there is not used that for that to occur? Holden Lewis Yes. But keep in mind our inventory turns twice the year roughly. So, I mean, it would be -- it'd be short-lived event. Robert McCarthy And then the last question because I know you want to move onto others on the call. Could you just talk about perhaps March in terms of your expectations kind of exiting February, taking into account the Easter shift, how you feel about the months? And how you feel about kind of the prospects exiting the months? Holden Lewis We felt better and better I think as the quarter we're on. Dan Florness And the months. Holden Lewis Yes and the months were on. When I think about the feedback that we’re getting from our regional Vice President about their marketplace, we talk about how -- in December we started to getting some pretty story that on the oil and gas business that we’re translating on the ground, but by the time you’ve got to February, you’re starting to see the oil and gas business really sort of pick-up again and showing itself in results. And frankly through March are continued to be case, I think they remain enthusiasm from that area. But what we began to see began to gain some real excitement as we based in February and then into March was the manufacturing site. And frankly the construction side, they’re seems have been a consensus that is come together through March from our regional that construction is doing much better and I think you can see some of that in the growth of the CSP products, I mean the fact they grew 10% plus in the quarter, I think some construction as well. So even as recently in December, the marketplace didn’t feel that great, but as we proceeded through the quarter and through the month of March. There was clear progress and improvement in the tender of the marketplace. Robert McCarthy Was there re-budgeted into the Easter shift during the April? I mean, how should we think about, it more than, Rob, 200 basis points in March or is that actually more favorable March rather? Would we expect further deceleration in April? Holden Lewis In quarter, the shift costs us about 50 basis points. In March, they cost us about a 150. It’s probably around 5 -- it's probably around third of the day, if you think about it Rob, historically. So, it gave us probably not $5 million lift in March and you probably get it back in April. Dan Florness Right. Operator  Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Robert Barry Thanks for all the nice earnings day materials. I wanted to follow up on this op margin -- sorry op leverage outlook. You keep referring to stable gross margin, but just given where the growth is coming from and it also sounds like we’re going to continue seeing some gross margin pressure here for a little while. So, is the bottom-line it for now op leverage is likely to be more in high-teens level or maybe even a little lower given the headcount is started to grow? Holden Lewis Yes. I mean, again, the motivation was just to emphasize the degree of which we think we can leverage operating expenses, right. That’s why we talk about it with the presumption that we hold gross margins stable. Now, as Dan alluded to, gross margins are much higher in Q1 than they'll be in Q2, Q3, so we’ll see what happens there. But, we remain committed to be able to achieve the leverage of the operating expenses. And we’re going to just keep you at work to try to dig into the structural decline in the gross margin that you start with. And we certainly had that conversation with our regionals and our folks. So, I think that there were some early signs that would in the freight side that maybe there is some progress there. So, we’re just going to have to keep working on improving the gross margin metric. But we do anticipate getting the leverage. With regards to the headcount, we would expect that to move up as demand goes up and also as we continue to accelerate our onsite timings. We onsite signing take some folks in the store and we would like to backfill those and really get a lot of energy in that store to keep growing from the new base. And so as growth in our growth drivers continue to move up than we would expect to add head. But again, we saw some good productivity in Q1, and we’re not just looking to give that productivity up. We got to do something to support our growth, but we’re not looking to begin to dilute that productivity by adding heads too quickly. Robert Barry Got you. I mean I don’t want to beat the dead horse here, but just to connect to dot. I mean it sounds like if gross margin is stable you can lever in the 20s. If gross margin continue to move down then we’re probably levering in the teens. Is that fair? Holden Lewis A couple of things I'll throw in -- in terms of what your top line growth assessment is. In the previous call, we've said south of 6% to 7% is difficult with the cost components we had coming out of 2015 and then through the first part of 2016. But that picture improves and lowers it some, and that's why you saw our ability to grow our operating expenses roughly 5.5%. And if you think what that, you have to take a look at what drove the operating expense increase when you look at Q1-to-Q1. I often try to pull things into some buckets so I can think about it easier. 25% to 30% of that increase is incentive comp whether it's in the commissioning in a store of bonus paid to some of the outside the store, the profit sharing contribution, so things that are expanding as a profit growth improves. That’s really what drives our labor cost to increase right now, it's not so much what headcount because the headcount you're adding typically and it appear this a lot of it is more on the entry level side so you could manage through that. If you think what's the next biggest group of cost that drove our expense up. We’ve been -- it's no secretly that we’ve been increasing our IT spend over a number of years. We have some pieces that are turning on actually this quarter that will help out of store or our onsite model quite meaningfully. We’re turning out our new website in Canada. So the things that we’re turning on that are spiteful investments, those investments we’ve been making and have been won through our P&L and the other component and I think that second bucket that was a jump from last year was the few of that Holder talked about. It’s a big increase in our cost component, that piece of it normalize than Q2, because last year from Q1 to Q2 fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll left that in Q2, but we haven't left in Q1. The final driver of increases is the continued success that we’re seeing in vending. When we add those vending there is an expense that shows up in our occupancy around the cost of the equipment. So those things are really what driving it and outside of that, managing the expense really-really quite well. And so, it puts us in a position when we go into the later part of the year, I believe that we’ll be able to be more optimistic. Dan Florness Thanks everybody, its 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal. I’ll close to where I started. I am pleased quite frankly with the quarter from the standpoint of the business is executing better, our end markets have given us some lift or given ourselves some lift. Thank you.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Manthey with Baird. David Manthey First of all, Holden, I think you said that gross margin within the fasteners and the non-fasteners were each higher, but the mix was the thing that drove that 30 basis points of the gross margin degradation. Did I catch that right? Holden Lewis That’s correct. If you look at just fasteners and non-fasteners without considering sort of the mix of those, you had margins that were slightly higher in both cases. David Manthey Great. Okay. So, as it relates to gross margins, two questions here. First, I’m wondering if you can help us understand the range of gross margin from sort of highest product to lowest and not to get specific on what those percentages are. But just that we understand the delta between the high and the low, and I’m thinking sort of the 80/20 rule here, products you sell everyday, not manufactured or modified products, but y just sort of general products available for sale. Could you just help us understand what the difference is between the high and the low? And then the second part of the question is, you mentioned that if you can keep the gross margin flat, you can get to 25% plus contribution margin. Assuming that this mix shift is going on is pretty much of secular trend given your growth initiative. If you’re able to keep gross margin flat, what would be the mechanism that would get you there that you haven't been able to achieve over the past several years? Dan Florness I’m going to chime in and help Holden with that question just given my years. First off, David, if you've know from the prior conversations, range of margins in our business are quite dramatic, depending on -- are you selling something that’s a relatively low value, a convenience pack time or something in our store that it is, I need it right now and price really doesn't matter, I just need that item to -- I’m basically brokering a transaction and I am getting paid a fee for brokering and I am buying a palette of this product or something. So, I mean the ranges can be from the teens to 80%. I mean, if you really want to get crazy with it, but if you look at the bulk of our business, you really have a range that goes from probably the mid 30s to the low 60s. And our fastener product line runs in the 50s, our non-fastener products as a group run in the 40s. And that kind of gives you some semblance of it, and you can see that play out when you’re looking at a lot of our competitors and where their gross margins are in relative to the products they sell. And the only wildcard I throw into that would be the fact that, in our industry we're a little bit unique in that we have one of the lowest cost structures for freight. And we all sell our product line that by and large a lot of items have relatively low value per pound. So freight becomes a big deal and as structural advantages, we have for years to come. If you look at some of the things that we have done or can do to manage to offset a piece of that mix shift. And I think it’s just that, we’ll be able to offset a piece of that overtime because we’ve talked about our onsite strategy. And what that means, just like we talked about our vending strategy or we talked about our non-fastener strategy 10 and 20 years ago. All those things, over time lowered our gross margin and the way we offset it, one is by better sourcing, and one is by structurally challenging ourselves to lower our trucking costs, and those are things we’ve done very effectively over the last 20 years. Third one is continuing to grow our exclusive brand offerings. And so, it’s really a case of looking at it and saying, here are our branded supplier offerings and working closely with those brands to grow that business, but over time maybe narrow some of those brands. The other one is having a strategy for exclusive brands. Today in the non-fastener world, exclusive brands are about 20% of our revenue. If you were looking at that a decade ago, it was probably 10% of our revenue. And I really don’t see a reason why that can't be closer to 30 at some point in time. So continuing to challenge and carve out different pieces, and you can bring the cost savings to your customer and improve your gross margin at the same time. David Manthey It’s helpful Dan. Thank you and best of luck over the next 50 years. Operator  Our next question comes from the line Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Ryan Merkel So I’m going to follow up on Dave’s question. I guess, well I was sort of wondering, you mentioned that mix was a 30 basis point year-over-year headwind. So, should we assume that that continues for the rest of the year or is there something that you’re thinking about that could lessen that impact? Holden Lewis I think given where our mix is going, I think you can look to us several years to probably have a headwind like that. I mean our growth drivers when you think about onsite and safety and vending and things like that, I mean, they lend themselves to that. So, do I think that given where we’re seeing our growth, that that is a reality each quarter of this year, it is. Now, as Dan alluded to, we still hope that there are some things that are going to contribute to somewhat better -- to somewhat better gross margins. Exclusive brands are something we talk about a lot. I called out the freight a little bit, because again while freight was a bit of a drag in the first quarter, there were some signs that perhaps the freight picture is getting a little bit better and hopefully as we go into Q2 and Q3, we’ll make further strides on that to help us sort of dig into that that more structural decline if you will. So, I think the answer is, yes. The structural mix is you were certainly there, but we think that we have means by wish to dig into that, if you will and improve. Also bear in mind that, we’re coming into the Q1 gross margin, when we think about the decline versus the fourth quarter. Some of that reflected the fact of the fourth quarter was an extremely strong period and we went and listed a couple of things. I mean, one thing we looked at was, fourth quarter of ’16 was up 40 basis points over the third quarter. If you look back historically, what fourth quarters typically do against third? So, I spotted that -- I’m sorry, 50 basis points against it. If you look back historically, what Q4 typically looks like against Q3? It’s been more like a 60 basis points decline. And last quarter, we called out we didn’t deleverage the trucking network as much as the historically perhaps have, and we had a number of other things that were small individually, but added up they just went our way. So, I think a better way to think about the quarter -- about the first quarter number is, historically, if you look at how Q1 plays our versus the prior year Q3. We were actually up 10 basis points versus last year's Q3. And historically, we’re down a couple of 20 basis points or so again the proceeding five years. So, we believe that we should be able to dig more into that structural decline than we did this quarter, but we feel like we’re making some progress on the freight, on the EBs and things of that sort. And yes, where we don’t view this as a de-gradation in our margin picture by any means. I'll just add a couple of thoughts to that. So fourth quarter -- or excuse me, third quarter we were at 49.3%. Here in the first quarter, we’re at 49.4%. I always look at fourth quarter is being noisy, whether it's up or down. The other thing is, if you look at our the $60 million in growth we’ve had in the last 12 months, 50% of that came from either onsite or vending. And so, there is a certain weighting that goes in there and we need to be executing better every day to offset the piece of that waiting. When I look at the margin in the first quarter, the only thing that I'm troubled by is, there is about 10 to 15 basis points in there that I find just personally frustrating, but, I think we’re executing quite a lot. Ryan Merkel Okay. That’s helpful. So, few things go your way, your framework for 25% to 30% incremental margins at mid single-digit, high single-digit growth that still profitable for this year, but you do need to freight and you probably need mix helping you a little bit. Is that fair? Dan Florness Well, I mean next two quarters, our comps change quite dramatically because we still were a relative -- if you think what's going on in 2015 and near the part of the 2016. We were getting traction on the onsite model. We were correcting some, getting some traction and fixing some things and some customers were improving from the standpoint of our vending model. So, if you think the growth has been occurring in the last 12 months and how that compares to the components of our business that were there in the 12 months prior to that, Q1 of 2016 is kind of that one of those half -- last high water marks and again, every year I ignore Q4, whether it’s a good or bad number that settle things in fix and much of anything. So, yes, the commentary around the incremental margins is really to try to make a point that we believe from an operating expense standpoint that we deleverage of those lines, and that’s despite the fact that we are -- as we grow, obviously we have that shock absorber effect coming from incentive comp and that sort of thing. But the points about the sort of the leverage, those incremental margins is, we feel that we can continue to leverage those lines and we did a nice job leveraging those lines in Q1, and we think that we’ll continue to do a good job leveraging those lines. And yes, if the gross margins cooperate then we do have some easier gross margins to compare against in Q2 to Q3. But, if the gross margins are stable then we think that we can get the kind of incremental margins that we spoken about. Operator  Our next question comes from Scott Graham from BMO Capital Markets. Scott Graham Obviously, a little bit more on this operating leverage. So, if you were to sort of sketch out, how you generate operating leverage, gross income versus your O&A expenses? Is there a way to look at this with sales, whether your sales where for it is and where the trends are going, mid to high single. Does that give you -- is that more of a gross margin thing leverage or SG&A and then sort of a higher level or let’s say low to mid single? Does that switch between those two lines? Could you kind of maybe sketch out how you look at that? Holden Lewis So, again, the guidance that we’ve sort of given on that is, if we hold gross margin stable then we think that we can get those types of incremental margins, just by leveraging the SG&A as we grow. So, when we envision discussing those incremental margin levels, I mean that really talked about leveraging our SG&A more so than the gross profit. And again, we saw some good signs of that, we talked a little bit about how employment grew and occupancy grew from a cost standpoint. But if you really look at it, when we think about like sales per head for instance, that was up 10% during the quarter, right, because we grew revenues nicely on slightly lower activity. Those are sort of the keys to how we get the type of incremental margins that we hope to get, but the discussion that we’ve had was really wanted to address our ability to leverage our operating expenses and intending to hold gross margin flat. So, if we can achieve significant improvements in our gross margin, I think that that’s additive but again that’s working against the structural mix that we’re talking about. Scott Graham Yes, I guess I get that holding, but where I guess where I am confirmed on this is that, if you’re putting more stuff in a box, we’re putting more boxes in the truck. There should be gross margin leverage on that too, right? Holden Lewis Well, that would be the leverage on the freight side in that year, you're having better utilization. First off, we have really excellent utilization of our trucking network to-date and so, it's not so much about you putting more boxes into a truck, it's -- those boxes you’re putting into the truck. What customer are they going to? What’s the nature of the business? You know, if it’s a box or an item that’s going to vending machine and it’s a safety product, it's going to have a different margin profile than if it's a box of fastener that’s going to an MRO user. And so, it's really depending on what that box is destined for. The other thing to remember is as a distributor, the very large majority of the cost that runs through COGS for us is simply the cost of the product. So there maybe pieces within COGS that we can get leverage on, but at the end of the day, the very large majority of what goes through cost on COGS is going to be the cost of the product. Scott Graham Okay, got you. And then follow-up question essentially is on share repurchases. Is there a point in time? Is there, I’m sure if you worked this carefully through an ROIC analysis and all that. Is there some type of trigger for share repurchase in ’17 that you envision? Holden Lewis I will spend on that one. We have no trigger price as this will buyback or we won’t buyback. That's a conversation we have with our Board on regular basis, we have not been in the market for some time. Historically, we have preferred to use our excess cash from the perspective of investing in the business, investing in our growth and if in case were we’re not drilling enough to use up all the cash generate because the cash we generate is quite attractive. History has said, the bulk of that cash, we return to our shareholders in the form of dividend and that’s just the way we structurally had it overtime. Our dividend release went out last evening has a good 10-year history to give you a perspective on that. No secret anyway in this call, our stock periods and then attractive multiple. And the periods where you’ve seen it, we’ve had some periods with a multiple fell off and we took some excess cash where we took some -- we incurred some borrowings to buy back some stock. But we focus our energy -- we really focus on time and energy on growing the business long term because we think that’s in the best interest of our shareholder. And in the short term, we return a fair part among the cash through a dividend. If you then recall that, I mean last year we had the leased locker program show up which is not something that so expected to begin the year and our first priority is to use our resources to be able to grow. And so we had a very nice quarter in Q1 by any measure. Q2 won’t be as high and we use some of those resources to acquire great company and… Dan Florness I'd say Q2 won’t be slightly come up with cash. Holden Lewis In terms of the cash, correct, relative to earnings, just because of the double tax payments. But in Q1 we use the resources to buy great company and as a result our leverage is based in the same area that it has been for some time, and at this point we prefer to kind of look for other opportunities internally to spend -- to spend our resources on and like we did last year you never know when they’re going to come up. So that remains a priority and what we are looking for. Operator Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. Robert McCarthy Holden, just one housekeeping item, which I am holding, I think we discussed, but just on Page 10 of your well-applauded new slide deck, you have the new benchmark out and just to remind, I think myself and investors, this is a new benchmark, the one you've published, right, that's going to be taking into account the five year average from ‘12 to ‘16 as opposed from a ‘11 to ‘15. Is that correct? Holden Lewis That’s correct and last year’s documents, we had two benchmarks that we were referring to. One was sort of our historic way of looking at it, which looked at most years from 1998 and then other one was sort of the five year average that last year would have included 2011 to 2015. As the calendar rolls forward so did our five year average into 2012 to 2016, and that’s where we are focusing on now for a benchmark. Robert McCarthy Perfect. Okay. Just want to make sure people saw that. Now just in terms of on the fastener side of the house, what’s your expectation for could you review and I do apologize, if you already kind of walk through this. Your expectations for what you saw for price in the quarter in terms of growth and then what are your expectations for the balance of year in terms of what we can see in place on the fastener side of the house? Holden Lewis Right. So, pricing was not a meaningful factor in the quarter. Price is something that we just continue to review at this point. Now, we obviously have seen some of our competitors take price increases. Many of them have talked about it publicly. We've seen charts where prices for metals are clearly up. So, it’s hard to conclude anything other than the environment today is certainly more inflationary, that has been quite some time. But that said, Fastenal has the advantage of being a FIFO company with a pretty long supply chain for fasteners and that means it takes a while for cost to hit our COGS. And that gives us the ability to evaluate how durable the marketplace is for pricing, and if you remember last year there was a time or two where we thought pricing could occur and then it wound up not materializing for probably demand reasons. And so, it’s nice to be able to get that sort of look, if you will. I think the real question at this point is, if the marketplace in fact does look like it’s going to be willing to accept pricing, is that something that we believe, we can get to protect our margins and protect our place in the market. And the answer is that, we think that we can, but we do have some time to evaluate at this point. Robert McCarthy I mean just looking at the math whether be any way to those price actions say the inflation did well attractive in this context for the balance of the year. Do you think, you could overcome the mix headwind in the gross margins? Will that math work or not? Holden Lewis Oh, in the short-term? Yes, surely. Robert McCarthy Yes. So, there is not used that for that to occur? Holden Lewis Yes. But keep in mind our inventory turns twice the year roughly. So, I mean, it would be -- it'd be short-lived event. Robert McCarthy And then the last question because I know you want to move onto others on the call. Could you just talk about perhaps March in terms of your expectations kind of exiting February, taking into account the Easter shift, how you feel about the months? And how you feel about kind of the prospects exiting the months? Holden Lewis We felt better and better I think as the quarter we're on. Dan Florness And the months. Holden Lewis Yes and the months were on. When I think about the feedback that we’re getting from our regional Vice President about their marketplace, we talk about how -- in December we started to getting some pretty story that on the oil and gas business that we’re translating on the ground, but by the time you’ve got to February, you’re starting to see the oil and gas business really sort of pick-up again and showing itself in results. And frankly through March are continued to be case, I think they remain enthusiasm from that area.

Holden Lewis In quarter, the shift costs us about 50 basis points. In March, they cost us about a 150. It’s probably around 5 -- it's probably around third of the day, if you think about it Rob, historically. So, it gave us probably not $5 million lift in March and you probably get it back in April. Dan Florness Right. Operator  Our next question comes from Robert Barry with Susquehanna. Robert Barry Thanks for all the nice earnings day materials.

You keep referring to stable gross margin, but just given where the growth is coming from and it also sounds like we’re going to continue seeing some gross margin pressure here for a little while.

But we do anticipate getting the leverage. With regards to the headcount, we would expect that to move up as demand goes up and also as we continue to accelerate our onsite timings. We onsite signing take some folks in the store and we would like to backfill those and really get a lot of energy in that store to keep growing from the new base. And so as growth in our growth drivers continue to move up than we would expect to add head. But again, we saw some good productivity in Q1, and we’re not just looking to give that productivity up. We got to do something to support our growth, but we’re not looking to begin to dilute that productivity by adding heads too quickly. Robert Barry Got you. I mean I don’t want to beat the dead horse here, but just to connect to dot. I mean it sounds like if gross margin is stable you can lever in the 20s. If gross margin continue to move down then we’re probably levering in the teens. Is that fair? Holden Lewis A couple of things I'll throw in -- in terms of what your top line growth assessment is. In the previous call, we've said south of 6% to 7% is difficult with the cost components we had coming out of 2015 and then through the first part of 2016. But that picture improves and lowers it some, and that's why you saw our ability to grow our operating expenses roughly 5.5%. And if you think what that, you have to take a look at what drove the operating expense increase when you look at Q1-to-Q1. I often try to pull things into some buckets so I can think about it easier. 25% to 30% of that increase is incentive comp whether it's in the commissioning in a store of bonus paid to some of the outside the store, the profit sharing contribution, so things that are expanding as a profit growth improves. That’s really what drives our labor cost to increase right now, it's not so much what headcount because the headcount you're adding typically and it appear this a lot of it is more on the entry level side so you could manage through that. If you think what's the next biggest group of cost that drove our expense up. We’ve been -- it's no secretly that we’ve been increasing our IT spend over a number of years. We have some pieces that are turning on actually this quarter that will help out of store or our onsite model quite meaningfully. We’re turning out our new website in Canada. So the things that we’re turning on that are spiteful investments, those investments we’ve been making and have been won through our P&L and the other component and I think that second bucket that was a jump from last year was the few of that Holder talked about. It’s a big increase in our cost component, that piece of it normalize than Q2, because last year from Q1 to Q2 fuel prices jumped up dramatically, so we'll left that in Q2, but we haven't left in Q1. The final driver of increases is the continued success that we’re seeing in vending. When we add those vending there is an expense that shows up in our occupancy around the cost of the equipment. So those things are really what driving it and outside of that, managing the expense really-really quite well. And so, it puts us in a position when we go into the later part of the year, I believe that we’ll be able to be more optimistic. Dan Florness Thanks everybody, its 45, 46 minutes past the hour. Thank you for your interest in Fastenal. I’ll close to where I started. I am pleased quite frankly with the quarter from the standpoint of the business is executing better, our end markets have given us some lift or given ourselves some lift. Thank you.

At this time, I'd like welcome everyone to the BioMarin's 4Q and Full-Year 2016 Financial Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. And it's my pleasure to introduce your host, Traci McCarty, the Head of Investor Relations at BioMarin. Traci McCarty - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, operator and thank you all for joining us today. With me here from the BioMarin management team are Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Hank Fuchs, President Worldwide Research and Development; Dan Spiegelman, Chief Financial Officer; Jeff Ajer, Chief Commercial Officer; and Robert Baffi, Head of Technical Operations. To remind you all, this non-confidential presentation contains forward-looking statements about the business prospects of BioMarin Pharmaceutical, including expectations regarding BioMarin's financial performance, commercial products, and potential future products in different areas of therapeutic research and development. Results may differ materially depending on the progress of BioMarin's product programs, actions of regulatory authorities, availability of capital, future actions in the pharmaceutical market, and developments by competitors and those factors detailed in BioMarin's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as 10-Q, 10-K, and 8-K Reports. Now I'd like to turn the call over to BioMarin's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, J.J. Bienaimé. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Traci. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today on the call. So 2016 was a momentous year for BioMarin, as full-year revenues topped $1 billion for the first time, coming in at $1.12 billion for the full year, an increase of 26% compared to 2015's full-year revenue. These results were driven by the approximately 50% year-over-year combined growth of Naglazyme and Kuvan. Jeff and his commercial team have done an impressive job building out our ex-North America Kuvan business and adding patients on therapy for Vimizim. In addition to commercial progress in 2016, we had a number of important developments and regulatory successes last year. We reported statistically significant results from each of our clinical studies with pegvaliase, Brineura, and vosoritide and proof-of-concept results with BMN 270 gene therapy for Hemophilia A. In addition, we had our regulatory filings accepted in both the U.S. and EU for Brineura. We reported out exciting preliminary results on our BMN 270 gene therapy program and we began our Phase 3 with vosoritide at the end of last year. Looking forward to 2017, double-digit growth revenues is expected to continue and total revenue is expected to be between $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. Also announced today, we anticipate positive non-GAAP results in 2017. In the years to come, we intend to steadily increase bottom line results, while continuing to reinvest in our pipeline. Dan and Jeff will provide more details on our commercial and financial expectations for the year. On the development and regulatory side, in 2017, we look forward to the potential approval and launch of Brineura in both the U.S. and Europe, the pegvaliase FDA filing in Q2, the start of the registration enabling Phase 2b study for BMN 270 gene therapy as well as additional data from the Cure Study (03:49) and the announcement of our next IND candidate. Our new gene therapy manufacturing facility is expected to be completed by mid-year, enabling us to move the BMN 270 program forward, without constraints on materials needed for the Phase 2b registration enabling study in the third quarter. Hank will provide also some more details in a moment. Before handing over the call to Jeff for more color on our commercial activities, I would like to make a few comments about recent headlines published on our industry and specifically about drug pricing as it relates to orphan drugs. While there have been lots of the headlines in the U.S. recently regarding increasing scrutiny of drug prices in general and even on some so-called orphan drugs, we believe that the products we have developed and plan on continuing to develop are and will continue to be largely insulated from these issues for several important reasons. As a first principle at BioMarin, we focus on providing highly innovative medicines in rare and ultra-rare conditions to patients, mostly children, who have either no or unsatisfactory treatment options. This is very different than repurposing and repricing older medications or older generic medications. Due to the innovation we create, our medications provide significant value to our patients and to the healthcare system. The value of this innovation is recognized globally where cost-conscious single-payer healthcare systems dominate. As we have noted before, for the products we sell globally, the majority of our revenues ultimately come from outside of the U.S. from single-payer systems and in fact, our U.S. Medicare sales represent less than 3% of our global revenues. Of critical importance, we price within a fairly narrow range globally, in other words, single-payer healthcare systems from more than 65 countries around the world currently agree to pay essentially the same price for our medications as we currently charge the U.S. government. Every day we successfully justify the value of our medications all over the world and feel very confident that we can continue to do so in the United States even in the face of increasing price scrutiny. So despite the uncertainty that many companies are facing related to potential new pricing policy, we feel the highly innovative nature of our products provide a high level of protection to our business. Now, I will turn the call over to Jeff, who will review the commercial business in more detail. Jeff? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, J.J. We delivered strong sales results in 2016 and I am very pleased with total BioMarin revenues for full-year 2016 exceeding the previous year by 26% and breaking the $1 billion mark for the first time. Starting with Vimizim, patients on commercial therapy grew 40% in 2016 from further penetration in existing markets and new access to eight markets, bringing the total number of active Vimizim markets to 41. 2016 also saw a continued rise in identified patients increasing to over 2,000. With approximately half of the currently identified patients on therapy and the fact that we continue to identify new patients, there is opportunity for significant continued growth from here. Vimizim net product revenues in the fourth quarter were $94 million or 59% higher than fourth quarter revenues of $59 million in 2015. For the full year, Vimizim net product revenue increased 55% year-over-year to $354 million and the franchise continues to benefit from robust underlying patient demand. Last quarter, we had communicated risk associated with order patterns in Brazil and Turkey. I'm glad to report that we are seeing a return to ordering stability in Turkey, but we remain cautious on Brazil and we'll continue to monitor this situation closely. Looking toward full-year 2017 Vimizim guidance, we expect between $400 million and $430 million in full-year revenues. Moving on to Naglazyme, net product revenues were $75 million in the quarter, a 25% increase year-over-year. For the full year, revenues of $297 million were essentially unchanged from the prior year. The number of commercial patients increased by 9% in 2016, an indicator of the strong and increasing underlying demand for Naglazyme, which drives our expectations for revenue growth in 2017. Quarterly volatility continued in 2016 with order timing in fourth quarter for Latin America driving strong results compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Based on these expectations, our guidance for full-year 2017 Naglazyme net product revenues is between $300 million and $330 million. Now on to Kuvan, 2016 represented the first full year of global sales of Kuvan by BioMarin since the acquisition of the PKU franchise in the international market from Merck Serono and we are very pleased with the results. Kuvan net product revenue contributed $90 million to the top line in the quarter, an increase of 38% year-over-year. For the full year, Kuvan net product revenue was $348 million, a 46% increase over 2015. North American sales were paced by an increase of 15% in commercial patients year-over-year, and in the international markets, we successfully navigated through the transition process and are now receiving orders directly from the majority of top markets worldwide. The combination of strong results in North America, combined with solid update internationally, gives us confidence in providing full-year 2017 guidance of between $380 million and $410 million, an increase of about 14% over 2016 at the mid-point. We expect these results in 2017 to be driven by growth opportunities in both North America and the addition of new patients in the international markets. Turning for a moment to market preparations ahead of a potential Brineura launch in the U.S. and Europe this year, the pre-commercial work is proceeding as planned and we expect to be well prepared upon approvals. As we've said previously, the commercial strategy for Brineura is different than for the launch of Vimizim. For Vimizim, in advance of launch, we had identified a large number of patients, many of which were able to gain access to Vimizim and which was the key in facilitating rapid updates during launch. The dynamics for CLN2 patients are very different relative to (11:21). Due to the rapid decline in function of children with CLN2, it is not possible to have a large pool of identified patients that are both waiting for and expected to be still suitable for treatment following launch. So, rather than existing patient identification, our primary focus is on raising awareness among physicians to facilitate early diagnosis. The goal is to have patients screened and diagnosed early, while they retain good function but (11:55) these will be the best candidates to benefit from the therapy when approved. We are also working to identify and prepare potential treatment centers. Some key centers have gained valuable treatment experience through participation in clinical trials and expanded access protocols, and we anticipate an official ATU approval in France, resulting in orders from the second quarter. We plan to leverage this experience in training new treatment sites following launch. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dan to provide more detail on fourth quarter and full-year financials. Dan? Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thanks, Jeff. Please see today's press release summarizing our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year 2016. As Jeff already reviewed top line results, I will briefly cover other key 2016 results and then provide our thoughts for continued growth in 2017 and beyond. In terms of 2016 operating expenses, across the board, they were in line with our prior guidance. Full-year research and development expenses were $662 million and SG&A expenses were $477 million. On the bottom line, we reported a full-year $630 million GAAP net loss, which included $599 million of intangible asset impairment charges associated with discontinuing the Kyndrisa and reveglucosidase alfa development programs in the second quarter. After reflecting the associated reversal of contingent consideration expense and a benefit from income taxes, the net GAAP impact of discontinuing these programs was $381 million. Therefore, full-year GAAP net loss excluding the discontinuation of Kyndrisa and 701 was approximately $250 million. Full year non-GAAP loss was $36 million. BioMarin defines non-GAAP income and loss as GAAP net income or loss excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as well as stock-based compensation expense, contingent consideration expense and certain other items such as the intangible asset charge associated with that Kyndrisa and BMN 701 program. BioMarin regularly uses these non-GAAP results and expectations internally to assess the financial operating performance and evaluate key business decisions, related to our principal business activities. The discovery, development, manufacturing and marketing of innovative biologic therapies. We ended the year with $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. In 2016, gross capital expenditures for the year were $168 million, driven by the buildout of the manufacturing facility in Shanbally, to support commercial supply of Vimizim, office facilities in Nevada and San Rafael to support ongoing research and development activities, as well as starting construction of our new gene therapy manufacturing facility in California. In addition, we added $83 million to inventory to support the continued growth of Vimizim and Kuvan and to prepare for the launch of Brineura. I would now like to turn to financial guidance. As J.J. already indicated, we expect 2017 total BioMarin revenue to be in a range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. I would note that this 2017 revenue forecast assumes the key currencies to remain at or around the current exchange rates through the year. Our revenue guidance assumes the launch of Brineura in 2017, so we believe we can achieve this guidance, should the launch has been delayed. Our 2017 revenue growth is just under 15% based on the midpoint of our guidance. Beyond 2017, we anticipate annual revenue growth to continue at approximately 15% throughout the rest of the decade, based on our current products, plus the launches of Brineura and Pegvaliase. Beyond that timeframe, we expect revenue growth to accelerate further, following the potential launches of products in our pipeline such as BMN 270 and vosoritide. Turning to operating expense guidance, in 2017, R&D expenses are projected to be in the range of $620 million to $650 million. While this would represent a decrease from 2016 R&D levels, we believe it's sufficient to drive development of our current portfolio and invest in next-generation products. Going beyond 2017, over the next few years, we would generally expect an increase in absolute R&D expenditures, while R&D as a percent of revenues will generally decline. 2017 SG&A expenses are expected to be in the range of $520 million to $550 million. The increase in SG&A expenses in 2017, compared to 2016 is driven by launch and execution of Brineura in the U.S. and Europe, as well as Pegvaliase launch preparation and expansion into additional markets for Vimizim and Kuvan. Combined R&D and SG&A total operating expenses in 2017 will increase around 4% compared to 2016 levels, a significantly lower rate of growth in the 15% revenue growth rate. Looking beyond 2017 and for the rest of the decade, we would expect the rate of future operating expense increases to continue to be lower than the revenue growth rate in order to provide increase in profitability. In terms of capital spending, we expect overall capital investment in 2017 to be similar to 2016 and between $160 million and $190 million primarily in manufacturing and laboratory facilities. In addition, there will be an approximately $100 million investment in additional inventory to support Brineura launch and continued growth in Vimizim revenues. Our GAAP net loss for 2017 is $140 million to $180 million. In terms of non-GAAP results, we expect that our positive result will be between $30 million and $70 million. This non-GAAP positive guidance for 2017 is the next step in the multi-year profitability plan that we laid out at the end of 2014. In our Q4 2014 earnings call, shortly after closing the Prosensa purchase and at that time based in part on expectations for drisapersen revenues, we set a goal for the company of non-GAAP profitability in 2017. The drisapersen was not ultimately approved. We work to keep that 2017 breakeven or better commitment. Based in part on making portfolio decisions such as effectively swapping talazoparib for ex-U.S. Kuvan and Pegvaliase rights and terminating BMN 701 as well as effectively controlling overall spending, we have consistently improved non-GAAP results in the 2015 through 2017 period. Looking beyond 2017 through the rest of the decade, we expect these trends of improving non-GAAP results to continue and to have profitability steadily increase, while also continuing to invest in the pipeline. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Hank, to provide an update on our development programs. Hank? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thank you, Dan. Starting with regulatory and development activities, several programs advanced in 2016 laying the groundwork for our next stage of growth and potential approvals. In the clinic, we announced in July of 2016 that BMN 270 gene therapy for the treatment of severe hemophilia A had demonstrated proof-of-concept results, leaving us to plan a potential registration enabling Phase 2b study in the third quarter of this year. We are very encouraged by results to-date with BMN 270. As announced last month in our ongoing study, Factor VIII levels have stabilized, liver function looks fine, and with the exception of one patient who's in the mild range, all patients are at least in the bottom of the normal range in terms of Factor VIII activity levels. Recall that in order to be enrolled in our studies, all subjects had to have severe hemophilia A with Factor VIII levels of 1% or less prior to treatment. Briefly, on the additional patients enrolled in the ongoing Phase 1/2 study, remember that we treated three new additional subjects with BMN 270 at 4x1013 vector genomes per kilogram without steroid prophylaxis at the end of 2016 per our amended protocol agreed to by the NHRA in the United Kingdom last October. Recall that we had the option to dose up to six additional patients, as doses are either 6x1013 or 4x1013 without steroid prophylaxis. Based on our early observations, we're expanding from three patients to six patients treated with 4x1013 and without prophylaxis based on what estimates serve thus far in the first three patients treated with 4x1013. We are very excited by the possibility of providing a one-and-done treatment option for people with severe Hemophilia A and look forward to sharing our next update on this program before the start of the potentially registration enabling study in the third quarter. We're also very encouraged and proud to have received PRIME designation from the EU earlier this month for BMN 270. To remind you, PRIME stands for priority medicines regulatory initiative, and was designated to BMN 270 based on the unmet need in hemophilia A due to breakthrough bleeds in prophylactic treatment settings, leading to sequelae such as – which means the negative after effects of the disease, including hemophilic arthropathy, permanent joint damages as a result of repeated bleeding in joints. This designation was further justified on the basis of preliminary clinical data in affected patients, supporting that a single intravenous administration results in sustained restoration of Factor VIII activity, reduction of annualized bleeding rates and improved quality of life of treated patients. BMN 270 gene therapy is the first and only product candidate for hemophilia A to have received this PRIME designation, so we're very pleased to have received this recognition for the program to-date. Turning to our gene therapy facility, it remains on track for completion in the second half of 2017, with the goal of producing materials to support our potentially registration enabling clinical study and initial commercial demand. We believe that making the investment now at our own gene therapy facility, we'll ensure that we have ample materials to supply our registration studies and potential commercial launch. The facility design was recently reviewed with U.S. health authorities and the feedback was consistent with our plans for construction and operational control. The approach laid out was well received and discussed in depth with industry, academic and health authority representatives. Our extensive experience in facility and process validation for our enzyme replacement products is a distinct advantage and positions us well to apply and adapt our successful strategies for now validation in gene therapy production, consistent with worldwide regulatory requirements. For example, our Head of Technical Operations, Robert Baffi, recently presented facility and process validation considerations for gene therapy products at the 21st Symposium on the Interface of Regulatory and Analytical Sciences for Biotechnology Health Products. Moving on to vosoritide for children with achondroplasia. Last year, we shared positive 6-month and 12-month data demonstrating a 50% increase in growth velocity and a dose of 15 micrograms per kilo. Based on these data, last summer, we initiated a global Phase 3 study with vosoritide in children with achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism. As we have said, we expect enrollment to take up to 18 months followed by one year and the like treatment for all patients, which – and this will be followed by an extension study. Our most recent data readout was from our newest program BMN 250, an enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of MPS IIIB or Sanfilippo Syndrome, Type B, a rapid and progressive neurodegenerative disease of young children. In January, we reported that in the dose finding portion of our study, the lowest dose of 30 milligrams per kilo demonstrated a significant reduction of heparan sulfate, a biomarker of brain tissue damage because of non-affected range. Since that review in January, we've safely dose escalated to the 100 milligram per kilogram dose and then the 300 milligram, our extension phase dose. In the second part of the study, we hope to demonstrate improvement in neurocognitive function, as measured by the development quotient or DQ scale, which is the number expressing the development of a child, determined by dividing the age of the group into which the test scores place the child by the child's chronological age multiplying by a 100. Stay tuned for a program update later this year. Turning to regulatory updates, we have a PDUFA date of April 27 for Brineura for the treatment of Batten's disease. And we look forward to potential approvals in both U.S. and EU this year. With respect to an advisory committee as we have said, we were told as part of the filing acceptance notice from the FDA that we should expect an AdCom and we have been preparing accordingly. Announcements about AdComs are only made by the FDA through notice in the Federal Register and we know that the PDUFA date is drawing near. However, the FDA does have the ability to take action on the applications with and without an AdCom. So stay tuned and we'll keep you apprised if anything changes. In the European Union, The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP meeting is coming up, and we expect a decision and we could expect a decision from the European Commission in the third quarter. We've been encouraged by our actions with EMA and look forward to the next steps in the process of potential approval of Brineura in the European Union. And finally, based on strong pivotal data with pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria, our plan is to file a BLA in the second quarter of this year. This is a large opportunity and our commercial efforts will be supported by the groundwork we've done with Kuvan, our product for less severely affected patients with phenylketonuria. With that, operator, we'd now like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Our first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three. In terms of hemophilia A, is there any factor activity level, say, greater than a 125% or so that the FDA is telling you is unacceptable? And then, when we look at how you're dosing the next three patients at 4x1013, how should we think about that as we look to dosing in your potentially pivotal program, and can you just comment on inter-patient variability at this dose? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Salveen, for your questions. So let me just say that we're in the midst of our health authority interactions on a global basis. And as you can tell from the PRIME designation, the health authorities have seen a lot of our data. And what I can say about your question about 125% is that that hasn't come up specifically. An upper limit of acceptable has not been specified to us by health authorities. And we're in the process of collecting further safety and dose response data and we've showed our strategy for picking a dose to take into the registration enabling trial to health authorities and we continue to be authorized to treat patients, both at the 4013 level and the 6013 level without steroid prophylaxis. In terms of how we're going to pick the dose for the coming trial, that'll be a combination of safety and efficacy data, and I think as long as we can achieve, I think the guidance – maybe an efficient way of saying is the guiding principle will be to select the lowest dose which produces clinically relevant efficacy. And while I can't tell you what the results of the ongoing 4013 dose study are, I can tell you that what we've seen has been sufficiently supportive that we want to dose three additional patients at that same 4013 dose level. And again, I can't tell you exactly about variability, but I will tell you that we are encouraged by what we're seeing, both in terms of activity and variability in activity. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So that's all to say we're very encouraged by where we are and we think that we should be in a great position to start registration enabling trials, as we've said, in the later part of this year. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks, Hank. And then, just in terms of Brineura for Batten's, how should we interpret the lack of an FDA panel announcement to-date? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I don't think I can say very much more beyond what I've already said just to recap. When the application was filed by the Food and Drug Administration, they told us to expect an advisory committee which is what they say for all New Drug Applications and Biologics License Applications. They then go on to say that as to when and whether there will actually be an advisory committee that they ask us to refrain from commenting on that in the public domain until notification of it has occurred in the Federal Register. Now, what you've also noticed is that there are fewer advisory committees and advisory committees are getting cancelled and actions are being taken in the absence of advisory committees. So the Food and Drug Administration can take an action by the PDUFA date without an advisory committee. And I've also commented before that although the PDUFA date is a goal, it's also possible for the Food and Drug Administration to take a little longer than the PDUFA date. So that's what we know at this point. And we continue to work extremely hard to bring Brineura to patients in the United States, and we also work extremely hard to bring Brineura to patients outside the United States. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Helpful. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one on BMN 250 in light of the recent data at WORLD and as you begin the process of measuring neurocognitive outcomes in MPS IIIB patients, can you describe maybe how complicated or the processes or maybe how inherently variable this can be in this patient population? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can a little bit. Let me first start by saying the quantitative terms, the natural history of Sanfilippo Syndrome, Type B is maybe not as well described as the Batten's natural history was at a similar point in development. There just hasn't been as much sample size put into it. And that's one challenge and we're working to augment that data set. Another challenge is we're using development quotient, which accommodates consideration of the patients' performance abilities in the numerator and their chronological age in the denominator. So the expectation, basically, is that normal will be flat, as you age. It may not be possible to achieve normal in a patient with an ongoing neurodegenerative disease. So the evaluation of interest will be to look for attenuation of the change in development quotient, and that difference from Batten's also makes – where the endpoint is not normalized for age, that difference also makes the discernment of effect a little bit more challenging. But having said all that and pulling back, Sanfilippo Syndrome is a devastating condition. Patients have some significant morbidity well into their teens and have lethality in the 20s and early 30s. And so, the idea of having enzyme replacement therapy demonstrating a dramatic improvement in outcome is, in this context, we believe, should be discernible, but of course, we've got to collect the data and prove it. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, a question on gene therapy program, BMN 270, recognizing that you still have to get buy-in from regulators, is there any consensus amongst your KOLs at this point as to what they think an optimal design might be for the Phase 2b trial for that drug? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, more at the level of principles than specific design considerations I mean I say off the top a couple of key things. Not everybody is treated the same way globally, two big buckets of treatment patterns, prophylactic therapy and on-demand therapy. I think the expectation would be that we'd have quantitative data on outcome in both patients who are treated in an on-demand context as well as in a prophylactic therapy context. I think that the hemophilia community is very oriented to clinical outcomes, as evidenced by bleed rate frequency, but also very important to them is the rate at which Factor VIII is used. I think the hemophilia community is accustomed to using Factor VIII levels to guide therapy and to interpret outcomes. So, I think that in a confirmatory trial context, Factor VIII levels could be a key supportive secondary endpoint, also because of their confidence about the predictive validity of a Factor VIII level, they're also very confident that a Factor VIII level above a certain amount would be reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit, which kind of speaks to another design consideration, which is the opportunity for Factor VIII level based outcomes to initiate the approval process. So that's something about population, that's something about endpoints. I think it's a little early yet to talk still about sample size and enrollment timeline that sort of thing. Other than to say that our sense is that there is a huge need for improved care of hemophilia patients where substantial morbidity that is not addressed by current Factor VIII replacement therapy and that was recognized by the EMA in their PRIME designation. Even the best available therapy doesn't stop bleeding events and patients on replacement therapy live lives that are restricted in their activity because of their predisposition to bleed. And a one-and-done treatment has the potential to restore the patients' clotting levels to physiologic levels, enabling patients to lead more normal lives. So all that together, I think, again, points us in the direction of being both very encouraged, excited, enthusiastic and feeling that it's a huge demand medically to push BMN 270 forward. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Thanks, Hank. Appreciate it. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Two from me, just one on guidance, can you just comment a little bit more specifically, will you be reporting ATU revenues for Brineura or will we see any of that this year? And then, second related to guidance, you commented on Turkey, Brazil and some lumpiness for Naglazyme. I mean any other impacts we should think about from ex-U.S. lumpiness throughout the year for some of the other products? And then, separately on BMN 270, can you just comment on the communication plan here? You're talking about an update on these six patients sometime maybe around the third quarter. Should we expect to see that update in addition to the Phase 2, Phase 3 study design or could they come separately? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Dan, you want to start with revenue recognition? Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, yeah, I mean we would report revenues when they come. The ATU revenue is likely small enough that it probably wouldn't get its own a line on the financial statements, but we'd happy to talk about it when it arrives. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is Jeff, Matt. I'll take the question. We address Turkey and Brazil. Previously, we have noted that order choppiness also comes from other markets and in Latin America. So all of Colombia and Chile as well as Brazil, those orders can be coming, large orders that are done relatively infrequently, so that can contribute to choppiness. Also, I think we've previously noted that certain countries in the Middle East also have similar pattern. So we get large infrequent orders from places like Saudi Arabia and some of the smaller markets in there. And that's not suggestive that there is anything wrong with the performance of those markets, it's just that the orders come in large chunks and infrequently. And I think that's it... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hank, the question on the BMN 270 communication plan. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, it's a little early to make an exact color on how that communication is going to unfold. I think we recognized there are two key components, which is what happened with the 4013 dose outcome wise and then, separately, what is the plan for the registration enabling trial. And part of the reason that's difficult is that we don't know what's going to get accepted at this scientific congresses and when, and because of the huge interest of the scientific community in the program, we do want to make sure that where we can get data presented at times at a meeting set, we afford that opportunity for our scientific investigator colleagues. But I do think that we should be able to count on hearing both the design of the registration enabling trial and the results of 4013 doses in advance of the initiation of the Phase 3 the registration enabling trial whether they're together or not. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, prefect. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Aspen Mori - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, guys. This is Aspen on for Ying. Thanks for taking my questions. So just two on BMN 250. First, the data presented at WORLD showed a couple AEs related to the ICV device. And I was wondering if you guys kind of talked about that and if you have any plans to address that. And then, have you seen any better effects with the 100 milligram dose in terms of HS reductions or any neurocognitive benefit? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Yeah. So we did have a couple of device related AEs in the Sanfilippo program initially. I would put together our results in the Batten's program and the Sanfilippo program and say that overall, we're really pleased by the tolerability, safety and convenience with intracerebroventricular administration of drug. There's always kinks that you have to work out beginning of studies, to get things humming and we're reasonably confident that we'll be able to do that in the Sanfilippo program, as we did in the Batten program. As regards the biologic activity of the 100 milligram dose, we haven't released those data yet. Stay tuned, although I will say, it's going to be hard to get a whole lot better than where we were, since we were more or less in the normal range already at the low dose. So set your expectation that we're not going to see like dramatically better by chemical efficacy than normal. And then, as to the first peeks at clinical activity data, we don't start collecting clinical data until we've gotten into the dose expansion phase – into the cohort expansion phase, so that's after we initiate enrollment of the 300 milligram dose. So it will be a while yet before we have outcome data from the open label trial to talk about. Aspen Mori - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Good afternoon, guys. This is Laura Chico on for Chris. I've got two questions for you. First on Brineura, I just wanted to make sure we're understanding correctly on the AdCom. I think there is some language from FDA that the states they have to provide notice to you by 60 days before the PDUFA date. I guess, is that an accurate interpretation or are you saying the 60-day guidance isn't necessarily a set in stone? And then, the second question is related to BMN 250. There were some data you showed at WORLD relating to grey matter volume declines. And just curious if there are some reasons why treatment might actually reduce brain volume. And then, perhaps a bigger picture, what's the most appropriate time range to begin to evaluate changes on an MRI basis? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Let me start with the first one, 60 days, is that firm and fast. I didn't in the moment have a synthesis of all the previous AdCom schedulings, but I would be shocked that if the FDA, as a matter of practice, has always noticed 60 days in advance. Clearly, the FDA has a lot of flexibility and that's why, in my prepared comments, I did acknowledge that it's February 23 and the PDUFA date is April 27. We recognized the same thing. But again, until they notice that there's an AdCom in the Federal Register, we can't comment on whether or when there will be an AdCom. And as I pointed out, the trend line recently is fewer AdComs and there's no obligation of the FDA to make an AdCom – to have an AdCom before taking an action date. So we're working hard with the FDA in doing everything we can, to enable them to take their action by the end of April. As J.J. mentioned at JPMorgan, it's a complicated study, it's a natural history control study. You know that the FDA wants to be careful about applying natural history data to pivotal trials, the pivotal decisions, and we're working hard with them to enable them to come to a conclusion. Your second question, was that about BMN 250 or was it about Brineura? The agreement on Brineura... Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry, Brineura. Yeah. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Okay. Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Yeah. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So the data we showed was that, so in that end, it's been shown that there is loss of volume of cortex, as the disease progresses and let's interpret that more – let's understand that more colloquially. The brain is melting as a consequence of the disease and brain matter is turning into a – is being liquefied. The rate at which that happens is slower on Brineura than not treated on Brineura. And the longer you follow patients, the more deceleration of that cortical grey matter loss is. We interpret this is all good and reflective of the treatment, the very large treatment benefit we observed. So our interpretation is all good. As Dan just handed me, because he is a better research analyst than I am, and pointed out that Kyndrisa AdCom announcement was October 15 and the meeting was November 24. So even in our own – I forget even in our own experience FDA has noticed later than the 60 days period. Thank you, Dan. That's it. Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, guys. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. John Scotti - Evercore ISI Hey, guys. It's John Scotti in for Mark. I had a couple of questions on that guidance. So the 15% revenue growth throughout the decade, is that something that you feel you can achieve every year or should we think about that is lumpy? And then, also, on the magnitude of OpEx leverage, you obviously mentioned you're going to have a lot of OpEx leverage, but specifically, I think 2017, the midpoint of OpEx guidance about 3% growth from 2016. So is that – I mean should we think about that as a fair run rate for OpEx growth on an absolute basis, going forward, relative to the 15% revenue growth or as OpEx growth going to be much higher than that? I'm just trying to get a handle on more quantitatively what we should model for OpEx leverage. Thanks. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So we're not in a position to give OpEx guidance more specifically than we have other than to say that it will be – we're committed to having it to be less than revenue growth. I would say that the magnitude of the difference in 2017 is almost by definition as big as it can be. So I think you should expect it to be less than that on average in the future years. And the revenue growth will have some lumpiness on an annual basis in and around 15% sort of consistently year-over-year is what we're both shooting for and forecast. Does that answer the question, John? John Scotti - Evercore ISI Yep, yep. Thanks a lot, Dan. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Great. Sure. You're welcome. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Mike Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, thanks for the question. Two topics. First was on gene therapy update, just broadly speaking and talking with FDA and EMEA, I guess, what are the one or two big topics of discussion, and specifically, are you trying to harmonize the two in order to obviously run one study to satisfy both. And since you got PRIME, is it safe to assume that, obviously, you got the breakthrough. And then my follow-up question is just on Kuvan. Can you just give us an update on the IP timelines given there was a second filer, so just want to clear up that one. I know you have a first settlement, is it safe to assume you want to settle that second (50:51)? Thanks so much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Actually Mike, I'm going to flip your questions a little bit, then I'm going to start with the approval for breakthrough. Can't get breakthrough designation as you can file on IND, we're still in the process of filing the U.S. IND. We did the studies... Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ...outside of the United States initially. So until we repatriate the IND, we can't apply for the breakthrough designation. But on your other question on what are the one, two big topics, I mean we're relatively earlier in the discussion, we're not planning on starting the pivotal trial until the third quarter or so. This is going to sound a little cheeky, but honestly, this is the real honest answer, the one or two top topics are how can we help you go faster? It fundamentally is what's behind the PRIME designation, and we did a lot of work with EMA in order to get into that slot so that they could have the resources and the structure to be able to help us go faster, without getting into specifics about our conversations with the Food and Drug Administration, suffice it to say that it's not substantively different. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Very helpful. Okay. And then, on... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I am taking regarding the Kuvan. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So I saw you have a subsequent question on this before I get to Kuvan. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah, no, I think, I'm good. So on Kuvan, there was one settlement, there is a second one just to be clear it's all disclosed, are you trying to get that one settled as well, what's the timing of that, are we going to hear about a court start, just remind us about that just we're all squared up on Kuvan? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, so we had a settlement with Dr. Reddy's and we have announced. And what happened is after we settled with Dr. Reddy's, the FDA actually switched the priority filing dates between Dr. Reddy's and Merck, which was all surprising, but it's the way it is. So we actually have been in discussion with Merck for a potential settlement, and then, we could have got to an agreement at the end of last year and we're getting close to a potential trial, so we decided to put it on hold. So there is a trial that is scheduled for sometime this summer and there should be a decision shortly thereafter. So I think it's pretty unlikely at this time, that we would settle in advance of the trial, not impossible, but I would say, unlikely. So that's kind of where we stand. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Dae Gon Ha - Leerink Partners LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Dae Gon dialing in for Joe. Two quick questions. One on BMN 270 and one on Brineura. So on BMN 270, I know you can't go into specifics of the data from the new 4x1013. But in terms of your internal expectations, can you comment on the patient variability range that you would be comfortable with going forward? And on Brineura, based on some of your experiences with EAP programs, is there some kind of an analog when we start modeling your launch trajectory? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Can I comment on the level of variability that I'd be comfortable with. I had occasion to look at the variability of our 6013 dose now that we've had a little bit longer duration of follow-up, because one of the considerations really is that when you have patients with different time courses, as they're coming up, things may seem more variable than when you get the steady state. I've looked at the variability of our expression levels relative to the variability of the most furthest advanced other gene therapy that's been in the clinic. Let me remind you that there is no other Factor VIII gene therapy in the clinic to our knowledge. So the comparison would be to Factor IX gene therapy. Now, most of the Factor IX gene therapy expressions that have occurred have occurred at relatively low levels. There is one company that's got reasonable activity, because of the use of an artificial procoagulant expression you could say it. Our variability of 6013 is comparable to the variability that others have noted in expression and it's an acceptable level of variability and now it's really one of the key considerations of choosing hemophilia as one of the first gene therapies that is to say there is not a tightly regulated system in the sense that the normal range of Factor VIII has itself a threefold level of variability. So we're pretty comfortable with the level of variability we've seen so far. And I'd say unless it's like a lot worse, at a different dose level, it does not pose a kind of a showstopper. And I would only again reemphasize that a consideration that's on the table is that some patients will end up outside of the normal range, we have one patient who is under the normal limit and one patient who is over the normal limit. We believe both of those patients are experiencing pretty substantial clinical benefit and we believe that those patients are exposed to have fairly negligible level of risk. And that's not just our belief about that, because clinician investigators are willing to enroll patients at the high dose level and health authorities are willing to allow us. So there was not just patients in a coming clinical trial, but conceivably in registration enabling trial at that high dose. So all that's why we are saying, we're reasonably comfortable with the level of variability that we're seeing and it was a big factor in choosing Factor VIII gene therapy as our gene therapy target. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Jeff, you want to say something else? (56:56) Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. What was the question on Brineura? Unknown Speaker Launch strategy (57:00). Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, I don't know whether Jeff should answer that or Hank should answer that. The Brineura EAP will be a little bit different than the Vimizim EAP in a sense that with Vimizim, we had prescribers who were really quite facile (57:21) at diagnosing and treating somatic forms of mucopolysaccharidosis. With Brineura, there is two different kinds of complications, first is procedurally it's different. There is the insertion of the indwelling brain device, the training for sterile technique for infusion of brain associated materials. And second is, the pace of the disease development is such that you really want to try to concentrate on finding patients earlier more than building up a inventory of prevalent patient population. So we think of the EAP primarily to serve the humanitarian purpose of enabling patients to have access, and secondarily to enable a larger group of physicians to become experienced with the procedure of study and finding patients. Jeff, did I do a reasonable job of... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think it's all the way... (58:18) Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Does that address your concern. I think what you're trying to do is get a revenue launch trajectory model, have I got that right? Dae Gon Ha - Leerink Partners LLC Yeah, I guess, I was just trying to get a bigger picture, since just some of the things I've heard from patient advocacy was that patients were actually dialing them to find out where they can go to get the drug for their respective children. So, I was wondering if that would be sort of front-loaded kind of a launch or if it's more of a gradual launch? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can share with you how we're thinking about some of the dimensions of launch trajectory modeling. And kind of building off of Hank's remarks, other than the patients that are in the clinical trials and the relatively small number of patients that are expected to be in early access programs, those patients generally with an expectation that their disease progression has stabilized on therapy, we don't expect where a large number of warehouse patients that will be a big bolus going on to treatment at launch. However, there are compelling cases of children that are appropriate for treatment and will be appropriate for treatment at the stage of progression that they're in with the diagnosis. So we expect that those patients would be highly interested and motivated in making a compelling case for getting on to therapy, so that will be a boon. We're going to be very careful about providing adequate assessment of treatment centers and then providing training and in-servicing so that those treatment centers can be successful treating children with this relatively complicated delivery mechanism. And then in terms of our own modeling, we note that with an incidence rate of one in 200,000, which is not bad compared to some – or not too low compared to some of the other epidemiology that we work with. The key to building out the base of patients on therapy will be getting them screened, diagnosed, then led to therapy relatively early in their progression of disease, kind of a tricky thing given the rapid progression of the disease. So that's a critical, critical commercial success factor, with an expectation that those patients stabilize and will be stable over time, and you can see how that patient population will build up materially as we get into launch. That's how we're thinking of it. Dae Gon Ha - Leerink Partners LLC Perfect. Thank you so much for that color. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters with Deustche Bank. Carlos Solorzano - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Good afternoon. This is Carlos in for Andrew Peters. Thanks for taking our questions. First, given that you mentioned that you can hit guidance without Brineura this year, does that range then imply an initial view what the CLN opportunity could be for 2017? And then also, with the announcement the gene therapy facility will be coming online later this year, how do you think about the opportunity to expand your gene therapy expertise into other areas, other diseases? And when you think you might be able to better describe these ambitions or potential programs? Thank you. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, I think, your first question was whether the fact that our guidance for 2017 incorporates both the potential revenues from Brineura launches or without, that comment on 2017 revenue thoughts for Brineura, and yes, I mean, yes, it does. I mean, we've indicated, Jeff just went through that we don't think this market is a warehouse of patients bolus market, plus, don't forget, in general, for our products the vast majority of the revenue opportunities are outside of the United States, which take some time, generally speaking, to get reimbursement and to get centers set up. So, we think a lot of the Brineura opportunity, obviously, for patients, but also as a commercial opportunity in the Naglazyme, Naglazyme plus area, but it's not a rapid first year up-tick. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Maybe I'll address the second part of your question from an R&D strategy point of view and say, yeah, we're really excited about the BMN 270 Hemophilia and we're the furthest along probably the biggest commercial opportunity in any gene therapy program for sure for replacement therapies. We want to be careful we don't stumble across the finish line there. So we're very focused on making sure that BMN 270 works. As to what else could come in the pipeline, we certainly do consider synergies with existing capabilities. Our track record is, we started with an incredibly small facility and generated three different protein products out of that relatively small facility. And Robert's team when they're thinking about the design of the gene therapy facility has given quite a lot of consideration to the potential to use it for other things, but let's not get the cart before the horse, you want to make sure that you get BMN 270 across the finish line. And our next IND, we have a tip (01:04:32) to what it's going to be, it could be a protein, it could be a small molecule, it could be a gene therapy. I think you just have to stay tuned and hopefully the competition will not figure out what we're going to do next before we announce it. Carlos Solorzano - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, first one on commercial, then one on the pipeline. Commercial, on Vimizim, your guidance for 2017 implies a pretty big deceleration versus 2016. Is that due simply to annualizing Brazil, so your conservatism over Brazil or are there other dynamics that are going on in the market in 2017? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Jeff you want to? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Hi, Phil. Jeff here, I'll take that one on. Actually I think the deceleration is maybe more of a percentage of growth deceleration than an absolute deceleration. I think we've noted over the past four quarters that the rate of patient addition which drives our revenue growth is still robust, but has slowed since the early launch quarters. So we're still expecting robust patient growth at the kind of level that we've been experiencing for last few quarters and that's driving our expectations of revenue growth going forward. There is some choppiness in order timing that we take into account as it relates to the 2017 year guidance and, of course, we're taking into account some expectations of turbulence in Brazil and a couple of other places. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And... Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. This is J.J., I will just add to that, that we have identified over 2,000 patients we believe there is a chance we, over time, might be able to identify 3,000 patients, but generally when we identify patients, we get a vast majority of them on therapy; it takes a while sometimes, but we generally get them there. And I think current price for the product, we basically have identified over $700 million of business. So there is still very significant room for growth here. We're just considering the instability in many markets around the world and we just want to be a little careful here. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So you had a second part of your question. Sorry, you had another question, Phil? Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Yeah, just one for Hank, and it's on the Brineura review. I think, after JPMorgan, a lot of people were commenting on the slide that you guys put up that showed, the concerns that the FDA had or the questions the FDA had about the Brineura review. Now today, I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into things, but it seems like you're more encouraged by the interactions that have happened over the last six weeks, included Brineura in your guidance, you didn't come out and say there wasn't going to be panel, but at least that was partially suggested. So, are we right to interpret that you're maybe feeling better today than you were six weeks ago or am I just way reading into things too much? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The latter. You're over-reading. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Is there any change in your feel about the application over the last six weeks or eight weeks? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Every day is a new day, Phil. I don't think we should be measuring like how I feel today or tomorrow or – all I can tell you is, we think we are really good in compelling datas. We know that the Food and Drug Administration is a tough reviewing body. J.J. has identified the elements of the review consideration, those are the elements of the review. On some level, I think you have to make up your own mind as to whether you think this should be approved or not? We're certainly doing everything we can to get this medication to American patients. At the same time that we're doing everything we can to get this drug to European patients as well. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Operator Next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi, guys. This is Evan on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the questions. First one on Pegvaliase. Have there been any updates on your interaction with FDA, anything else that needs to happen for the second quarter submission? And then one on BMN 250. Do you think we'll be able to follow our regular pivotal trial design plans similar to what saw with Brineura and that this trial that you're conducting quite essentially service the pivotal trial for filing. Thank you. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, on Pegvaliase, I think we've said we've completed our dialogue with the Food and Drug Administration in terms of what we need. So I wouldn't expect any – well, I don't anticipate that there will be any further updates about the filing timeline as it pertains to the Food and Drug Administration. We're working really hard and there is a lot in the files, it's a big program, it's a complex program. Our plan is to get it done in the second quarter. But, you know, it's also a case of because it's big and complex, we wanted to make sure that we do it really well. So, team is working really hard on managing both of those, do it on time and do it well. And as far as the prediction of the design of BMN 250 trial, it's really early. I think it depends on to some extent whether there are reliable activity signals to come out of the Phase 1/2 study and how reliable and how big those are. If they're gigantic, like they were with Brineura, maybe we can imagine a study that leads to registration that's Brineura like or if they are of a smaller nature than any of the contemporaneous control arm to satisfy health authorities. What I would say is that the context of a disease being just a little less aggressive than Batten's disease, and little less well-developed natural history inclines to believe that is less likely that it will be a Brineura-like registration program, but it's again also too early to be definitive one way or the other about that. Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc. And one final follow-up on pegvaliase. Have you gotten any indication or hints that FDA may call for a panel? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so let's say we're filing in potentially three months and then action dates will be somewhere later. So it's really pretty early to speculate. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And again, we're right on top of the PDUFA date and I can't tell you whether there's going to be a PDUFA come for (01:12:02) Brineura, so. Unknown Speaker It is early (01:12:03) Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks for taking my questions. I had two, both on the hemophilia program. So the first is just really on the potential recruitment of the Phase 2b study. Just what steps are you taking or can you take to help drive the recruitment there? And second, help us understand who is an appropriate patient in a commercial setting for gene therapy, for BMN 270 specifically, and how representative your Phase 2b trial will be in, sort of, in that representing that patient population? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Ian. On recruitment, there's not much to say about that yet, other than the benefit here is huge, and it's really attracted a lot of people's attention. There are 50,000 severely affected hemophilia patients in the developed world. So I think a reasonably – you know, it's kind of ultra-rare, I think it's on an ultra-rare population together with a huge benefit, together with a huge unmet need in terms of recurring, bleeding, I don't know that I would say the recruitment should be viewed as a big challenge in this. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, I actually (01:13:41) think there was a survey done recently by one of the analysts on the line here, that shows that the majority of hemophilia patients were looking forward to gene therapy and were very interested in actually being treated with gene therapy. So, assuming the survey is representative of reality, that we shouldn't have any real problems recruiting here. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Just, as I think about that second part of my question, while we introduced price into it, obviously, there is the potential for an opinion from the payers. And just curious how you're thinking about the magnitude of the treatment benefit you're likely to provide, which is obviously life changing, price, given the benchmarks that have already been said, with the currently available therapies, and how do you access the entirety of the population as opposed to limiting it to the most severe? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we will start and Jeff can comment, I think right now the first trial and the data we generating is in severe hemophilia patients, which are patients that expect less than 1% of factoring at this time and we understand, and Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, that it's about half of the hemophilia A population, which would be around 50,000 patients in the world. That's a pretty significant number. On the pricing issue, actually earlier Hank alluded to the fact that treatment varies in different parts of the world, but definitely in the U.S. and several European countries, the vast majority of severe hemophilia A patients are treated with prophylactic regimen. In the U.S., the average cost of recombinant Factor VIII injections for prophylactic regimen is north of $250,000 a year. So this is a very important metric, which – and relatively significant amount of money unless it's an average, that you can guide us in the pricing here, basing in terms of pharmacoeconomic analysis, this is one of the few indications where you have some very clear metrics as to the cost of current therapy and that's just the cost of recombinant Factor VIII injections, that does not include all the cost of the burden of the disease. As Hank said, when you have joint deterioration, joint destruction, need for joint surgeries, emergency room visits, the cost is very significant on annual basis for these patients. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And for that reason, that's why prophylactic therapy in spite of that expense, as J.J. just mentioned, is the standard of care and the residual morbidity of un-prophylactic patients is quite substantial. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And Jeff, you want to add anything to that? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. No. I think you've done great unless Ian has an even specific (01:16:58). M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) No, no that answers my question. Thank you. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Tim Lugo with William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. This is Raju on for Tim. In your prepared remarks, I believe the mid-point of the Kuvan revenue for 2017 is 14%. Can you just break that out into North America versus international? I think you said 15% increase in commercial patients year-over-year in 2016? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So you're asking about the breakout of the Kuvan growth in 2017? Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah. Based on the 2016 growth in North America as well? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, I think I'm just going to have to the point you to the mix between U.S. and North America in 2016 is the best guidance we're in a position to guide to. The growth rates won't be dramatically different in the two regions. So the relative relationship should stay similar. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Fair enough. And then with a competitive – on BMN 270, with a competitor launching in a Phase 1/2 trial in the near-term, can you just remind us on the IP and is there a potential for future overlap down the line? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Overlap of what exactly occurring (01:18:40)? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I believe he is asking whether there is intellectual property conflicts between some of our products and some of the others being launched. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We don't believe so. There is one patent in the gene therapy field that could potentially be an issue, (01:19:04) but it's expiring I think in around 2020 or so. So it becomes kind of irrelevant, but beside this one, I'm not familiar with anything else that could create a freedom to operate issue here for us. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay great. And then just one last one, J.J., it sounds like gene therapy manufacturing in 2017 and IND coming from in-house, what's the appetite for BD with your balance sheet looking pretty solid right now? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, I think it's likely (01:19:38) we will announce another IND candidates this year, might or might not be a gene therapy product, I think might or might not be coming from the outside or it is probably likely to come from the inside research. So we did have a pretty significant pipeline that Hank's and Robert's team are managing. So we are pretty busy. That being said, we always look at what's available in the outside because we are getting asked to look at some potential assets on a going-forward basis. So, there are some ongoing discussions, but the bar is relatively high. But if we do find the right assets for us strategically at the right price, there could be some BD in the next few months. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Right. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay with Credit Suisse. Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on gene therapy. I was hoping if you could just give us a little bit more color and then help us understand how long those patients had been sort of on-steroids and off-steroids at the last update? And then how that relates to sort of the upcoming data that we'll see without these prophylactic steroids? Thank you. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, we haven't given kind of the details on the steroid duration and partly that's because we're still settling out and we want to see what happens at 4013, we want to see what the final dose selected is. So, I'd say, stay tuned for more of that metrics on that. Fundamentally though, the thing I want to remind people about is that we're talking about a very short course of steroids in the grand scheme of things. And for example, at our JPMorgan update as compared to our World Federation of Hemophilia update only six months earlier, all patients have gotten off of steroids. So, we're not talking about a life of steroid therapy, we're not even talking about a year of steroid therapy, we're talking about weeks or months of steroid therapy. And these kinds of regimens of steroids are pretty well-tolerated. Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Willey with Stifel. Prakhar Verma - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Prakhar Verma on for Steve. A question on Brineura. So do you expect administration to be in a setting similar to what was used in a Phase 3 trial or whether you – or do you expect administration to be allowed in the heart patient setting, and potentially even in a home infusion setting over time? Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Let me start by saying our clinical experience has been in a more carefully observed setting than home, for example. And I don't know that we're going to be superfast at moving patients from more intensive to less intensive oversight, and so we have a bit more track record and experience of safely managing infusions. And I guess the other thing to say about that is, none of this is final really until the product is labeled which probably won't happen until the product is approved. Prakhar Verma - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Gin Hee with Gabelli (01:23:35). Unknown Speaker Hi, thank you for taking my question. I've got two longer-term questions, first on BMN 270, I'm wondering further down the road, would you plan to build your commercial infrastructure yourself or you would also consider acquiring from outside? And second on Brineura, if it is approved, I'm just wondering what's your thought on voucher, we've seen that recently the value has come down from last two transactions. So do you have any plans to sell it or keep it for yourself? Thank you. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So I think the first question was related to commercialization plans for gene therapy? Unknown Speaker Manufacturing, in-sourcing or outsourcing? Unknown Speaker No I think what – (01:24:14) Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. No I think – Sorry, (01:24:17) your line is a little scrambled here, could you repeat the questions please? Unknown Speaker Right. So my first question on gene therapy, I'm asking about your commercial plan further down the road, do you plan to build your commercial infrastructure yourself or you would also consider on clearing from outside? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, Jeff here. We would plan to commercialize our BMN 270 program internally and not to externalize that effort. Unknown Speaker And all... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And you have the same question for Brineura? Unknown Speaker Yes, second for Brineura, we've seen that the voucher, if it is approved, I'm just wondering what's your thought on that? We've seen that the voucher, the recent value has come down from last... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So, you're talking about the Priority Review Voucher? Unknown Speaker That's correct. So, just wondering... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We would sell this voucher or keep it? Unknown Speaker Right. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I mean, yeah, we haven't decided yet considering that many of the products we are currently developing would – all of them or many of them would qualify for voucher also it's likely we will sell it, (01:25:34) but we haven't decided. Unknown Speaker Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the call over to the Chairman and CEO for your final remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, thank you operator. So, in summary, 2016 was a momentous year for BioMarin commercially and from a regulatory and development perspective. So we achieved over $1.1 billion in revenues. We are laying the groundwork for substantial returns going forward, and the top line growth in 2017 is expected to be around 15%, while our expenses will only increase by about 4%. So, we're in the midst of a transformation from a small one or two product company toward a profitable growth story with multiple late-stage shots on goal, a number of which have blockbuster potential. So we begin 2017 from a position of strength as our approved products are expected to drive record revenues again, so we await the outcome of our next potential approved products in Brineura. We intend to file the BLA for our next product Pegvaliase next quarter to be enroll to the global vosoritide study and to move our gene therapy product into registration enabling study or studies. So on the heels of these products, BMN 250 for Sanfilippo Type B will continue to enroll into expansion phase of the study and we anticipate filing of a new IND molecule to enter the clinic in the second half of this year. So, thank you for your continued support and for joining us today. Operator And that does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator Our first question comes from the line of Salveen Richter. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking my questions. I have three. In terms of hemophilia A, is there any factor activity level, say, greater than a 125% or so that the FDA is telling you is unacceptable? And then, when we look at how you're dosing the next three patients at 4x1013, how should we think about that as we look to dosing in your potentially pivotal program, and can you just comment on inter-patient variability at this dose? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Salveen, for your questions. So let me just say that we're in the midst of our health authority interactions on a global basis. And as you can tell from the PRIME designation, the health authorities have seen a lot of our data. And what I can say about your question about 125% is that that hasn't come up specifically. An upper limit of acceptable has not been specified to us by health authorities. And we're in the process of collecting further safety and dose response data and we've showed our strategy for picking a dose to take into the registration enabling trial to health authorities and we continue to be authorized to treat patients, both at the 4013 level and the 6013 level without steroid prophylaxis. In terms of how we're going to pick the dose for the coming trial, that'll be a combination of safety and efficacy data, and I think as long as we can achieve, I think the guidance – maybe an efficient way of saying is the guiding principle will be to select the lowest dose which produces clinically relevant efficacy. And while I can't tell you what the results of the ongoing 4013 dose study are, I can tell you that what we've seen has been sufficiently supportive that we want to dose three additional patients at that same 4013 dose level. And again, I can't tell you exactly about variability, but I will tell you that we are encouraged by what we're seeing, both in terms of activity and variability in activity. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So that's all to say we're very encouraged by where we are and we think that we should be in a great position to start registration enabling trials, as we've said, in the later part of this year. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks, Hank. And then, just in terms of Brineura for Batten's, how should we interpret the lack of an FDA panel announcement to-date? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I don't think I can say very much more beyond what I've already said just to recap. When the application was filed by the Food and Drug Administration, they told us to expect an advisory committee which is what they say for all New Drug Applications and Biologics License Applications. They then go on to say that as to when and whether there will actually be an advisory committee that they ask us to refrain from commenting on that in the public domain until notification of it has occurred in the Federal Register. Now, what you've also noticed is that there are fewer advisory committees and advisory committees are getting cancelled and actions are being taken in the absence of advisory committees. So the Food and Drug Administration can take an action by the PDUFA date without an advisory committee. And I've also commented before that although the PDUFA date is a goal, it's also possible for the Food and Drug Administration to take a little longer than the PDUFA date. So that's what we know at this point. And we continue to work extremely hard to bring Brineura to patients in the United States, and we also work extremely hard to bring Brineura to patients outside the United States. Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. Helpful. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first one on BMN 250 in light of the recent data at WORLD and as you begin the process of measuring neurocognitive outcomes in MPS IIIB patients, can you describe maybe how complicated or the processes or maybe how inherently variable this can be in this patient population? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can a little bit. Let me first start by saying the quantitative terms, the natural history of Sanfilippo Syndrome, Type B is maybe not as well described as the Batten's natural history was at a similar point in development. There just hasn't been as much sample size put into it. And that's one challenge and we're working to augment that data set. Another challenge is we're using development quotient, which accommodates consideration of the patients' performance abilities in the numerator and their chronological age in the denominator. So the expectation, basically, is that normal will be flat, as you age. It may not be possible to achieve normal in a patient with an ongoing neurodegenerative disease. So the evaluation of interest will be to look for attenuation of the change in development quotient, and that difference from Batten's also makes – where the endpoint is not normalized for age, that difference also makes the discernment of effect a little bit more challenging. But having said all that and pulling back, Sanfilippo Syndrome is a devastating condition. Patients have some significant morbidity well into their teens and have lethality in the 20s and early 30s. And so, the idea of having enzyme replacement therapy demonstrating a dramatic improvement in outcome is, in this context, we believe, should be discernible, but of course, we've got to collect the data and prove it. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, a question on gene therapy program, BMN 270, recognizing that you still have to get buy-in from regulators, is there any consensus amongst your KOLs at this point as to what they think an optimal design might be for the Phase 2b trial for that drug? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, more at the level of principles than specific design considerations I mean I say off the top a couple of key things. Not everybody is treated the same way globally, two big buckets of treatment patterns, prophylactic therapy and on-demand therapy. I think the expectation would be that we'd have quantitative data on outcome in both patients who are treated in an on-demand context as well as in a prophylactic therapy context. I think that the hemophilia community is very oriented to clinical outcomes, as evidenced by bleed rate frequency, but also very important to them is the rate at which Factor VIII is used. I think the hemophilia community is accustomed to using Factor VIII levels to guide therapy and to interpret outcomes. So, I think that in a confirmatory trial context, Factor VIII levels could be a key supportive secondary endpoint, also because of their confidence about the predictive validity of a Factor VIII level, they're also very confident that a Factor VIII level above a certain amount would be reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit, which kind of speaks to another design consideration, which is the opportunity for Factor VIII level based outcomes to initiate the approval process. So that's something about population, that's something about endpoints. I think it's a little early yet to talk still about sample size and enrollment timeline that sort of thing. Other than to say that our sense is that there is a huge need for improved care of hemophilia patients where substantial morbidity that is not addressed by current Factor VIII replacement therapy and that was recognized by the EMA in their PRIME designation. Even the best available therapy doesn't stop bleeding events and patients on replacement therapy live lives that are restricted in their activity because of their predisposition to bleed. And a one-and-done treatment has the potential to restore the patients' clotting levels to physiologic levels, enabling patients to lead more normal lives. So all that together, I think, again, points us in the direction of being both very encouraged, excited, enthusiastic and feeling that it's a huge demand medically to push BMN 270 forward. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC All right. Thanks, Hank. Appreciate it. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Two from me, just one on guidance, can you just comment a little bit more specifically, will you be reporting ATU revenues for Brineura or will we see any of that this year? And then, second related to guidance, you commented on Turkey, Brazil and some lumpiness for Naglazyme. I mean any other impacts we should think about from ex-U.S. lumpiness throughout the year for some of the other products? And then, separately on BMN 270, can you just comment on the communication plan here? You're talking about an update on these six patients sometime maybe around the third quarter. Should we expect to see that update in addition to the Phase 2, Phase 3 study design or could they come separately? Thanks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Dan, you want to start with revenue recognition? Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, yeah, I mean we would report revenues when they come. The ATU revenue is likely small enough that it probably wouldn't get its own a line on the financial statements, but we'd happy to talk about it when it arrives. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And this is Jeff, Matt. I'll take the question. We address Turkey and Brazil. Previously, we have noted that order choppiness also comes from other markets and in Latin America. So all of Colombia and Chile as well as Brazil, those orders can be coming, large orders that are done relatively infrequently, so that can contribute to choppiness. Also, I think we've previously noted that certain countries in the Middle East also have similar pattern. So we get large infrequent orders from places like Saudi Arabia and some of the smaller markets in there. And that's not suggestive that there is anything wrong with the performance of those markets, it's just that the orders come in large chunks and infrequently. And I think that's it... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hank, the question on the BMN 270 communication plan. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes, it's a little early to make an exact color on how that communication is going to unfold. I think we recognized there are two key components, which is what happened with the 4013 dose outcome wise and then, separately, what is the plan for the registration enabling trial. And part of the reason that's difficult is that we don't know what's going to get accepted at this scientific congresses and when, and because of the huge interest of the scientific community in the program, we do want to make sure that where we can get data presented at times at a meeting set, we afford that opportunity for our scientific investigator colleagues. But I do think that we should be able to count on hearing both the design of the registration enabling trial and the results of 4013 doses in advance of the initiation of the Phase 3 the registration enabling trial whether they're together or not. Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay, prefect. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Aspen Mori - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, guys. This is Aspen on for Ying. Thanks for taking my questions. So just two on BMN 250. First, the data presented at WORLD showed a couple AEs related to the ICV device. And I was wondering if you guys kind of talked about that and if you have any plans to address that. And then, have you seen any better effects with the 100 milligram dose in terms of HS reductions or any neurocognitive benefit? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Yeah. So we did have a couple of device related AEs in the Sanfilippo program initially. I would put together our results in the Batten's program and the Sanfilippo program and say that overall, we're really pleased by the tolerability, safety and convenience with intracerebroventricular administration of drug. There's always kinks that you have to work out beginning of studies, to get things humming and we're reasonably confident that we'll be able to do that in the Sanfilippo program, as we did in the Batten program. As regards the biologic activity of the 100 milligram dose, we haven't released those data yet. Stay tuned, although I will say, it's going to be hard to get a whole lot better than where we were, since we were more or less in the normal range already at the low dose. So set your expectation that we're not going to see like dramatically better by chemical efficacy than normal. And then, as to the first peeks at clinical activity data, we don't start collecting clinical data until we've gotten into the dose expansion phase – into the cohort expansion phase, so that's after we initiate enrollment of the 300 milligram dose. So it will be a while yet before we have outcome data from the open label trial to talk about. Aspen Mori - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Raymond James. Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Good afternoon, guys. This is Laura Chico on for Chris. I've got two questions for you. First on Brineura, I just wanted to make sure we're understanding correctly on the AdCom. I think there is some language from FDA that the states they have to provide notice to you by 60 days before the PDUFA date. I guess, is that an accurate interpretation or are you saying the 60-day guidance isn't necessarily a set in stone? And then, the second question is related to BMN 250. There were some data you showed at WORLD relating to grey matter volume declines. And just curious if there are some reasons why treatment might actually reduce brain volume. And then, perhaps a bigger picture, what's the most appropriate time range to begin to evaluate changes on an MRI basis? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Let me start with the first one, 60 days, is that firm and fast. I didn't in the moment have a synthesis of all the previous AdCom schedulings, but I would be shocked that if the FDA, as a matter of practice, has always noticed 60 days in advance. Clearly, the FDA has a lot of flexibility and that's why, in my prepared comments, I did acknowledge that it's February 23 and the PDUFA date is April 27. We recognized the same thing. But again, until they notice that there's an AdCom in the Federal Register, we can't comment on whether or when there will be an AdCom. And as I pointed out, the trend line recently is fewer AdComs and there's no obligation of the FDA to make an AdCom – to have an AdCom before taking an action date. So we're working hard with the FDA in doing everything we can, to enable them to take their action by the end of April. As J.J. mentioned at JPMorgan, it's a complicated study, it's a natural history control study. You know that the FDA wants to be careful about applying natural history data to pivotal trials, the pivotal decisions, and we're working hard with them to enable them to come to a conclusion. Your second question, was that about BMN 250 or was it about Brineura? The agreement on Brineura... Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Oh, sorry. Yeah, sorry, Brineura. Yeah. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Okay. Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Yeah. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So the data we showed was that, so in that end, it's been shown that there is loss of volume of cortex, as the disease progresses and let's interpret that more – let's understand that more colloquially. The brain is melting as a consequence of the disease and brain matter is turning into a – is being liquefied. The rate at which that happens is slower on Brineura than not treated on Brineura. And the longer you follow patients, the more deceleration of that cortical grey matter loss is. We interpret this is all good and reflective of the treatment, the very large treatment benefit we observed. So our interpretation is all good. As Dan just handed me, because he is a better research analyst than I am, and pointed out that Kyndrisa AdCom announcement was October 15 and the meeting was November 24. So even in our own – I forget even in our own experience FDA has noticed later than the 60 days period. Thank you, Dan. That's it. Laura Chico - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thanks, guys. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with Evercore ISI. John Scotti - Evercore ISI Hey, guys. It's John Scotti in for Mark. I had a couple of questions on that guidance. So the 15% revenue growth throughout the decade, is that something that you feel you can achieve every year or should we think about that is lumpy? And then, also, on the magnitude of OpEx leverage, you obviously mentioned you're going to have a lot of OpEx leverage, but specifically, I think 2017, the midpoint of OpEx guidance about 3% growth from 2016. So is that – I mean should we think about that as a fair run rate for OpEx growth on an absolute basis, going forward, relative to the 15% revenue growth or as OpEx growth going to be much higher than that? I'm just trying to get a handle on more quantitatively what we should model for OpEx leverage. Thanks. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So we're not in a position to give OpEx guidance more specifically than we have other than to say that it will be – we're committed to having it to be less than revenue growth. I would say that the magnitude of the difference in 2017 is almost by definition as big as it can be. So I think you should expect it to be less than that on average in the future years. And the revenue growth will have some lumpiness on an annual basis in and around 15% sort of consistently year-over-year is what we're both shooting for and forecast. Does that answer the question, John? John Scotti - Evercore ISI Yep, yep. Thanks a lot, Dan. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Great. Sure. You're welcome. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Mike Yee with RBC Capital Markets. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Hey, thanks for the question. Two topics. First was on gene therapy update, just broadly speaking and talking with FDA and EMEA, I guess, what are the one or two big topics of discussion, and specifically, are you trying to harmonize the two in order to obviously run one study to satisfy both. And since you got PRIME, is it safe to assume that, obviously, you got the breakthrough. And then my follow-up question is just on Kuvan. Can you just give us an update on the IP timelines given there was a second filer, so just want to clear up that one. I know you have a first settlement, is it safe to assume you want to settle that second (50:51)? Thanks so much. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. Actually Mike, I'm going to flip your questions a little bit, then I'm going to start with the approval for breakthrough. Can't get breakthrough designation as you can file on IND, we're still in the process of filing the U.S. IND. We did the studies... Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Got it. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. ...outside of the United States initially. So until we repatriate the IND, we can't apply for the breakthrough designation. But on your other question on what are the one, two big topics, I mean we're relatively earlier in the discussion, we're not planning on starting the pivotal trial until the third quarter or so. This is going to sound a little cheeky, but honestly, this is the real honest answer, the one or two top topics are how can we help you go faster? It fundamentally is what's behind the PRIME designation, and we did a lot of work with EMA in order to get into that slot so that they could have the resources and the structure to be able to help us go faster, without getting into specifics about our conversations with the Food and Drug Administration, suffice it to say that it's not substantively different. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Very helpful. Okay. And then, on... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I am taking regarding the Kuvan. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So I saw you have a subsequent question on this before I get to Kuvan. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Yeah, no, I think, I'm good. So on Kuvan, there was one settlement, there is a second one just to be clear it's all disclosed, are you trying to get that one settled as well, what's the timing of that, are we going to hear about a court start, just remind us about that just we're all squared up on Kuvan? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, so we had a settlement with Dr. Reddy's and we have announced. And what happened is after we settled with Dr. Reddy's, the FDA actually switched the priority filing dates between Dr. Reddy's and Merck, which was all surprising, but it's the way it is. So we actually have been in discussion with Merck for a potential settlement, and then, we could have got to an agreement at the end of last year and we're getting close to a potential trial, so we decided to put it on hold. So there is a trial that is scheduled for sometime this summer and there should be a decision shortly thereafter. So I think it's pretty unlikely at this time, that we would settle in advance of the trial, not impossible, but I would say, unlikely. So that's kind of where we stand. Michael Yee - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Joseph Schwartz with Leerink Partners. Dae Gon Ha - Leerink Partners LLC Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is Dae Gon dialing in for Joe. Two quick questions. One on BMN 270 and one on Brineura. So on BMN 270, I know you can't go into specifics of the data from the new 4x1013. But in terms of your internal expectations, can you comment on the patient variability range that you would be comfortable with going forward? And on Brineura, based on some of your experiences with EAP programs, is there some kind of an analog when we start modeling your launch trajectory? Thanks. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Can I comment on the level of variability that I'd be comfortable with. I had occasion to look at the variability of our 6013 dose now that we've had a little bit longer duration of follow-up, because one of the considerations really is that when you have patients with different time courses, as they're coming up, things may seem more variable than when you get the steady state. I've looked at the variability of our expression levels relative to the variability of the most furthest advanced other gene therapy that's been in the clinic. Let me remind you that there is no other Factor VIII gene therapy in the clinic to our knowledge. So the comparison would be to Factor IX gene therapy. Now, most of the Factor IX gene therapy expressions that have occurred have occurred at relatively low levels. There is one company that's got reasonable activity, because of the use of an artificial procoagulant expression you could say it. Our variability of 6013 is comparable to the variability that others have noted in expression and it's an acceptable level of variability and now it's really one of the key considerations of choosing hemophilia as one of the first gene therapies that is to say there is not a tightly regulated system in the sense that the normal range of Factor VIII has itself a threefold level of variability. So we're pretty comfortable with the level of variability we've seen so far. And I'd say unless it's like a lot worse, at a different dose level, it does not pose a kind of a showstopper. And I would only again reemphasize that a consideration that's on the table is that some patients will end up outside of the normal range, we have one patient who is under the normal limit and one patient who is over the normal limit. We believe both of those patients are experiencing pretty substantial clinical benefit and we believe that those patients are exposed to have fairly negligible level of risk. And that's not just our belief about that, because clinician investigators are willing to enroll patients at the high dose level and health authorities are willing to allow us. So there was not just patients in a coming clinical trial, but conceivably in registration enabling trial at that high dose. So all that's why we are saying, we're reasonably comfortable with the level of variability that we're seeing and it was a big factor in choosing Factor VIII gene therapy as our gene therapy target. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Jeff, you want to say something else? (56:56) Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. What was the question on Brineura? Unknown Speaker Launch strategy (57:00). Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, I don't know whether Jeff should answer that or Hank should answer that. The Brineura EAP will be a little bit different than the Vimizim EAP in a sense that with Vimizim, we had prescribers who were really quite facile (57:21) at diagnosing and treating somatic forms of mucopolysaccharidosis. With Brineura, there is two different kinds of complications, first is procedurally it's different. There is the insertion of the indwelling brain device, the training for sterile technique for infusion of brain associated materials. And second is, the pace of the disease development is such that you really want to try to concentrate on finding patients earlier more than building up a inventory of prevalent patient population. So we think of the EAP primarily to serve the humanitarian purpose of enabling patients to have access, and secondarily to enable a larger group of physicians to become experienced with the procedure of study and finding patients. Jeff, did I do a reasonable job of... Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I think it's all the way... (58:18) Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Does that address your concern. I think what you're trying to do is get a revenue launch trajectory model, have I got that right? Dae Gon Ha - Leerink Partners LLC Yeah, I guess, I was just trying to get a bigger picture, since just some of the things I've heard from patient advocacy was that patients were actually dialing them to find out where they can go to get the drug for their respective children. So, I was wondering if that would be sort of front-loaded kind of a launch or if it's more of a gradual launch? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I can share with you how we're thinking about some of the dimensions of launch trajectory modeling. And kind of building off of Hank's remarks, other than the patients that are in the clinical trials and the relatively small number of patients that are expected to be in early access programs, those patients generally with an expectation that their disease progression has stabilized on therapy, we don't expect where a large number of warehouse patients that will be a big bolus going on to treatment at launch. However, there are compelling cases of children that are appropriate for treatment and will be appropriate for treatment at the stage of progression that they're in with the diagnosis. So we expect that those patients would be highly interested and motivated in making a compelling case for getting on to therapy, so that will be a boon. We're going to be very careful about providing adequate assessment of treatment centers and then providing training and in-servicing so that those treatment centers can be successful treating children with this relatively complicated delivery mechanism. And then in terms of our own modeling, we note that with an incidence rate of one in 200,000, which is not bad compared to some – or not too low compared to some of the other epidemiology that we work with. The key to building out the base of patients on therapy will be getting them screened, diagnosed, then led to therapy relatively early in their progression of disease, kind of a tricky thing given the rapid progression of the disease. So that's a critical, critical commercial success factor, with an expectation that those patients stabilize and will be stable over time, and you can see how that patient population will build up materially as we get into launch. That's how we're thinking of it. Dae Gon Ha - Leerink Partners LLC Perfect. Thank you so much for that color. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Peters with Deustche Bank. Carlos Solorzano - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Good afternoon. This is Carlos in for Andrew Peters. Thanks for taking our questions. First, given that you mentioned that you can hit guidance without Brineura this year, does that range then imply an initial view what the CLN opportunity could be for 2017? And then also, with the announcement the gene therapy facility will be coming online later this year, how do you think about the opportunity to expand your gene therapy expertise into other areas, other diseases? And when you think you might be able to better describe these ambitions or potential programs? Thank you. Daniel K. Spiegelman - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, I think, your first question was whether the fact that our guidance for 2017 incorporates both the potential revenues from Brineura launches or without, that comment on 2017 revenue thoughts for Brineura, and yes, I mean, yes, it does. I mean, we've indicated, Jeff just went through that we don't think this market is a warehouse of patients bolus market, plus, don't forget, in general, for our products the vast majority of the revenue opportunities are outside of the United States, which take some time, generally speaking, to get reimbursement and to get centers set up. So, we think a lot of the Brineura opportunity, obviously, for patients, but also as a commercial opportunity in the Naglazyme, Naglazyme plus area, but it's not a rapid first year up-tick. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Maybe I'll address the second part of your question from an R&D strategy point of view and say, yeah, we're really excited about the BMN 270 Hemophilia and we're the furthest along probably the biggest commercial opportunity in any gene therapy program for sure for replacement therapies. We want to be careful we don't stumble across the finish line there. So we're very focused on making sure that BMN 270 works. As to what else could come in the pipeline, we certainly do consider synergies with existing capabilities. Our track record is, we started with an incredibly small facility and generated three different protein products out of that relatively small facility. And Robert's team when they're thinking about the design of the gene therapy facility has given quite a lot of consideration to the potential to use it for other things, but let's not get the cart before the horse, you want to make sure that you get BMN 270 across the finish line. And our next IND, we have a tip (01:04:32) to what it's going to be, it could be a protein, it could be a small molecule, it could be a gene therapy. I think you just have to stay tuned and hopefully the competition will not figure out what we're going to do next before we announce it. Carlos Solorzano - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Phil Nadeau with Cowen & Company. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, first one on commercial, then one on the pipeline. Commercial, on Vimizim, your guidance for 2017 implies a pretty big deceleration versus 2016. Is that due simply to annualizing Brazil, so your conservatism over Brazil or are there other dynamics that are going on in the market in 2017? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Jeff you want to? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. Hi, Phil. Jeff here, I'll take that one on. Actually I think the deceleration is maybe more of a percentage of growth deceleration than an absolute deceleration. I think we've noted over the past four quarters that the rate of patient addition which drives our revenue growth is still robust, but has slowed since the early launch quarters. So we're still expecting robust patient growth at the kind of level that we've been experiencing for last few quarters and that's driving our expectations of revenue growth going forward. There is some choppiness in order timing that we take into account as it relates to the 2017 year guidance and, of course, we're taking into account some expectations of turbulence in Brazil and a couple of other places. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And... Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. This is J.J., I will just add to that, that we have identified over 2,000 patients we believe there is a chance we, over time, might be able to identify 3,000 patients, but generally when we identify patients, we get a vast majority of them on therapy; it takes a while sometimes, but we generally get them there. And I think current price for the product, we basically have identified over $700 million of business. So there is still very significant room for growth here. We're just considering the instability in many markets around the world and we just want to be a little careful here. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. Okay. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So you had a second part of your question. Sorry, you had another question, Phil? Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Yeah, just one for Hank, and it's on the Brineura review. I think, after JPMorgan, a lot of people were commenting on the slide that you guys put up that showed, the concerns that the FDA had or the questions the FDA had about the Brineura review. Now today, I don't know, maybe I'm reading too much into things, but it seems like you're more encouraged by the interactions that have happened over the last six weeks, included Brineura in your guidance, you didn't come out and say there wasn't going to be panel, but at least that was partially suggested. So, are we right to interpret that you're maybe feeling better today than you were six weeks ago or am I just way reading into things too much? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. The latter. You're over-reading. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Is there any change in your feel about the application over the last six weeks or eight weeks? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Every day is a new day, Phil. I don't think we should be measuring like how I feel today or tomorrow or – all I can tell you is, we think we are really good in compelling datas. We know that the Food and Drug Administration is a tough reviewing body. J.J. has identified the elements of the review consideration, those are the elements of the review. On some level, I think you have to make up your own mind as to whether you think this should be approved or not? We're certainly doing everything we can to get this medication to American patients. At the same time that we're doing everything we can to get this drug to European patients as well. Phil Nadeau - Cowen & Co. LLC Got it. Thanks for taking my questions. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yes. Operator Next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi, guys. This is Evan on for Geoff. Thanks for taking the questions. First one on Pegvaliase. Have there been any updates on your interaction with FDA, anything else that needs to happen for the second quarter submission? And then one on BMN 250. Do you think we'll be able to follow our regular pivotal trial design plans similar to what saw with Brineura and that this trial that you're conducting quite essentially service the pivotal trial for filing. Thank you. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, on Pegvaliase, I think we've said we've completed our dialogue with the Food and Drug Administration in terms of what we need. So I wouldn't expect any – well, I don't anticipate that there will be any further updates about the filing timeline as it pertains to the Food and Drug Administration. We're working really hard and there is a lot in the files, it's a big program, it's a complex program. Our plan is to get it done in the second quarter. But, you know, it's also a case of because it's big and complex, we wanted to make sure that we do it really well. So, team is working really hard on managing both of those, do it on time and do it well. And as far as the prediction of the design of BMN 250 trial, it's really early. I think it depends on to some extent whether there are reliable activity signals to come out of the Phase 1/2 study and how reliable and how big those are. If they're gigantic, like they were with Brineura, maybe we can imagine a study that leads to registration that's Brineura like or if they are of a smaller nature than any of the contemporaneous control arm to satisfy health authorities. What I would say is that the context of a disease being just a little less aggressive than Batten's disease, and little less well-developed natural history inclines to believe that is less likely that it will be a Brineura-like registration program, but it's again also too early to be definitive one way or the other about that. Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc. And one final follow-up on pegvaliase. Have you gotten any indication or hints that FDA may call for a panel? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, so let's say we're filing in potentially three months and then action dates will be somewhere later. So it's really pretty early to speculate. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And again, we're right on top of the PDUFA date and I can't tell you whether there's going to be a PDUFA come for (01:12:02) Brineura, so. Unknown Speaker It is early (01:12:03) Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc. Fair enough. Thanks for taking the questions. Appreciate it. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Thanks for taking my questions. I had two, both on the hemophilia program. So the first is just really on the potential recruitment of the Phase 2b study. Just what steps are you taking or can you take to help drive the recruitment there? And second, help us understand who is an appropriate patient in a commercial setting for gene therapy, for BMN 270 specifically, and how representative your Phase 2b trial will be in, sort of, in that representing that patient population? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Hi, Ian. On recruitment, there's not much to say about that yet, other than the benefit here is huge, and it's really attracted a lot of people's attention. There are 50,000 severely affected hemophilia patients in the developed world. So I think a reasonably – you know, it's kind of ultra-rare, I think it's on an ultra-rare population together with a huge benefit, together with a huge unmet need in terms of recurring, bleeding, I don't know that I would say the recruitment should be viewed as a big challenge in this. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, I actually (01:13:41) think there was a survey done recently by one of the analysts on the line here, that shows that the majority of hemophilia patients were looking forward to gene therapy and were very interested in actually being treated with gene therapy. So, assuming the survey is representative of reality, that we shouldn't have any real problems recruiting here. M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Just, as I think about that second part of my question, while we introduced price into it, obviously, there is the potential for an opinion from the payers. And just curious how you're thinking about the magnitude of the treatment benefit you're likely to provide, which is obviously life changing, price, given the benchmarks that have already been said, with the currently available therapies, and how do you access the entirety of the population as opposed to limiting it to the most severe? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Well, we will start and Jeff can comment, I think right now the first trial and the data we generating is in severe hemophilia patients, which are patients that expect less than 1% of factoring at this time and we understand, and Jeff, correct me if I'm wrong, that it's about half of the hemophilia A population, which would be around 50,000 patients in the world. That's a pretty significant number. On the pricing issue, actually earlier Hank alluded to the fact that treatment varies in different parts of the world, but definitely in the U.S. and several European countries, the vast majority of severe hemophilia A patients are treated with prophylactic regimen. In the U.S., the average cost of recombinant Factor VIII injections for prophylactic regimen is north of $250,000 a year. So this is a very important metric, which – and relatively significant amount of money unless it's an average, that you can guide us in the pricing here, basing in terms of pharmacoeconomic analysis, this is one of the few indications where you have some very clear metrics as to the cost of current therapy and that's just the cost of recombinant Factor VIII injections, that does not include all the cost of the burden of the disease. As Hank said, when you have joint deterioration, joint destruction, need for joint surgeries, emergency room visits, the cost is very significant on annual basis for these patients. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And for that reason, that's why prophylactic therapy in spite of that expense, as J.J. just mentioned, is the standard of care and the residual morbidity of un-prophylactic patients is quite substantial. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And Jeff, you want to add anything to that? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. No. I think you've done great unless Ian has an even specific (01:16:58). M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States) No, no that answers my question. Thank you. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Thanks. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Tim Lugo with William Blair. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks for taking the question. This is Raju on for Tim. In your prepared remarks, I believe the mid-point of the Kuvan revenue for 2017 is 14%. Can you just break that out into North America versus international? I think you said 15% increase in commercial patients year-over-year in 2016? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So you're asking about the breakout of the Kuvan growth in 2017? Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Yeah. Based on the 2016 growth in North America as well? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, I think I'm just going to have to the point you to the mix between U.S. and North America in 2016 is the best guidance we're in a position to guide to. The growth rates won't be dramatically different in the two regions. So the relative relationship should stay similar. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Fair enough. And then with a competitive – on BMN 270, with a competitor launching in a Phase 1/2 trial in the near-term, can you just remind us on the IP and is there a potential for future overlap down the line? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Overlap of what exactly occurring (01:18:40)? Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I believe he is asking whether there is intellectual property conflicts between some of our products and some of the others being launched. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We don't believe so. There is one patent in the gene therapy field that could potentially be an issue, (01:19:04) but it's expiring I think in around 2020 or so. So it becomes kind of irrelevant, but beside this one, I'm not familiar with anything else that could create a freedom to operate issue here for us. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay great. And then just one last one, J.J., it sounds like gene therapy manufacturing in 2017 and IND coming from in-house, what's the appetite for BD with your balance sheet looking pretty solid right now? Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, I think it's likely (01:19:38) we will announce another IND candidates this year, might or might not be a gene therapy product, I think might or might not be coming from the outside or it is probably likely to come from the inside research. So we did have a pretty significant pipeline that Hank's and Robert's team are managing. So we are pretty busy. That being said, we always look at what's available in the outside because we are getting asked to look at some potential assets on a going-forward basis. So, there are some ongoing discussions, but the bar is relatively high. But if we do find the right assets for us strategically at the right price, there could be some BD in the next few months. Raju Y. Prasad - William Blair & Co. LLC Right. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Kennen MacKay with Credit Suisse. Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one on gene therapy. I was hoping if you could just give us a little bit more color and then help us understand how long those patients had been sort of on-steroids and off-steroids at the last update? And then how that relates to sort of the upcoming data that we'll see without these prophylactic steroids? Thank you. Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah, we haven't given kind of the details on the steroid duration and partly that's because we're still settling out and we want to see what happens at 4013, we want to see what the final dose selected is. So, I'd say, stay tuned for more of that metrics on that. Fundamentally though, the thing I want to remind people about is that we're talking about a very short course of steroids in the grand scheme of things. And for example, at our JPMorgan update as compared to our World Federation of Hemophilia update only six months earlier, all patients have gotten off of steroids. So, we're not talking about a life of steroid therapy, we're not even talking about a year of steroid therapy, we're talking about weeks or months of steroid therapy. And these kinds of regimens of steroids are pretty well-tolerated. Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Willey with Stifel. Prakhar Verma - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Hi, thanks for taking my question. This is Prakhar Verma on for Steve. A question on Brineura. So do you expect administration to be in a setting similar to what was used in a Phase 3 trial or whether you – or do you expect administration to be allowed in the heart patient setting, and potentially even in a home infusion setting over time? Thank you. Henry J. Fuchs - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Let me start by saying our clinical experience has been in a more carefully observed setting than home, for example. And I don't know that we're going to be superfast at moving patients from more intensive to less intensive oversight, and so we have a bit more track record and experience of safely managing infusions. And I guess the other thing to say about that is, none of this is final really until the product is labeled which probably won't happen until the product is approved. Prakhar Verma - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Gin Hee with Gabelli (01:23:35). Unknown Speaker Hi, thank you for taking my question. I've got two longer-term questions, first on BMN 270, I'm wondering further down the road, would you plan to build your commercial infrastructure yourself or you would also consider acquiring from outside? And second on Brineura, if it is approved, I'm just wondering what's your thought on voucher, we've seen that recently the value has come down from last two transactions. So do you have any plans to sell it or keep it for yourself? Thank you. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So I think the first question was related to commercialization plans for gene therapy? Unknown Speaker Manufacturing, in-sourcing or outsourcing? Unknown Speaker No I think what – (01:24:14) Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. No I think – Sorry, (01:24:17) your line is a little scrambled here, could you repeat the questions please? Unknown Speaker Right. So my first question on gene therapy, I'm asking about your commercial plan further down the road, do you plan to build your commercial infrastructure yourself or you would also consider on clearing from outside? Jeffrey Robert Ajer - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Yeah. So, Jeff here. We would plan to commercialize our BMN 270 program internally and not to externalize that effort. Unknown Speaker And all... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. And you have the same question for Brineura? Unknown Speaker Yes, second for Brineura, we've seen that the voucher, if it is approved, I'm just wondering what's your thought on that? We've seen that the voucher, the recent value has come down from last... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. Okay. So, you're talking about the Priority Review Voucher? Unknown Speaker That's correct. So, just wondering... Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. We would sell this voucher or keep it? Unknown Speaker Right. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. I mean, yeah, we haven't decided yet considering that many of the products we are currently developing would – all of them or many of them would qualify for voucher also it's likely we will sell it, (01:25:34) but we haven't decided. Unknown Speaker Thank you. Operator There are no further questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the call over to the Chairman and CEO for your final remarks. Jean-Jacques Bienaimé - BioMarin Pharmaceutical, Inc. So, thank you operator. So, in summary, 2016 was a momentous year for BioMarin commercially and from a regulatory and development perspective. So we achieved over $1.1 billion in revenues. We are laying the groundwork for substantial returns going forward, and the top line growth in 2017 is expected to be around 15%, while our expenses will only increase by about 4%. So, we're in the midst of a transformation from a small one or two product company toward a profitable growth story with multiple late-stage shots on goal, a number of which have blockbuster potential. So we begin 2017 from a position of strength as our approved products are expected to drive record revenues again, so we await the outcome of our next potential approved products in Brineura. We intend to file the BLA for our next product Pegvaliase next quarter to be enroll to the global vosoritide study and to move our gene therapy product into registration enabling study or studies. So on the heels of these products, BMN 250 for Sanfilippo Type B will continue to enroll into expansion phase of the study and we anticipate filing of a new IND molecule to enter the clinic in the second half of this year.

Shantanu Narayen Thanks, Mike and good afternoon. FY ‘16 was another great year for Adobe. Our record growth and net income were driven by strong performance in Creative Cloud annualized recurring revenue, continued growth of Adobe Document Cloud subscriptions and strong revenue and bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud. In Q4, we delivered record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP earnings per share in Q4, was $0.80 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.90. For the year, we grew total revenue to $5.85 billion, which represents 22% annual growth. GAAP earnings per share in FY ‘16, was $2.32 and non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.01. In Digital Media, we are advancing the state-of-the-art for content and setting the standard for creativity and digital documents. We exited the year with over $4 billion of annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q4 was $316 million and was driven by continued adoption and retention of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud across all customer segments. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creativity and design. And in FY ‘16, we expanded our customer base while continuing to deliver a rapid stream of product innovations. We achieved record Creative revenue of $886 million in Q4. For the year, we achieved Creative revenue of $3.2 billion, which represents 38% year-over-year growth. At the heart of the Creative Cloud is the promise of continuous innovation and the pace at which we are delivering new technology is accelerating. Last month at our MAX Creativity Conference, we unveiled next-generation desktop, mobile and cloud services for designers, photographers and filmmakers as well as sneak previews of creative technologies in the areas of virtual reality, image matching and digital painting. Our Creative customers have always counted on us to turn the future into reality. Creative Cloud is the place designers expect to get the best tools and services in emerging categories like Experience Design and 3D. Earlier this week, we released two public betas, Adobe XD for Windows, the first all-in-one tool for designing, prototyping and sharing user experiences for web and mobile apps; and Project Felix, a new application that enables designers to create photorealistic composites with 2D images and 3D assets. Adobe Stock continues to gain momentum in the multibillion dollar stock image category. In Q4, we launched the Adobe Stock contributor site, a new platform that allows users to upload and sell photos, illustrations, videos and vectors to the world’s largest creative community. We also announced a partnership with Reuters that will bring their expansive video and photography library, across news, sports, business and entertainment to the Adobe Stock service. With creativity exploding across the globe, geographic expansion represents a significant growth opportunity. In November, we launched Adobe Creative Cloud for teens in China. China is one of the world’s largest digital economies and we can now address its extensive community of designers and creatives. We believe everyone is creative and should have the opportunity to express themselves. Adobe Spark, our consumer-friendly web and mobile solution for creating and sharing professional quality animated videos, web stories and social graphics, is gaining traction with small businesses, social marketers and students. We will continue to invest in Adobe Spark, which we see as a key way to reach broader consumer audience as part of Creative Cloud. The world’s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud, leverages the PDF standard we pioneered and enables businesses to transform inefficient paper-based processes to digital. In Q4, Document Cloud revenue was $191 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $475 million. Document Cloud represents the modern way for managing digital documents. Core cloud capabilities like mobile and collaboration as well as services like electronic signatures have become a requirement for our customers. As a result, Document Cloud subscriptions now eclipse licensing of perpetual Acrobat software on adobe.com and we expect to see stronger migration among our enterprise customers in the coming year. As part of the ongoing innovation delivered through Document Cloud, this quarter, we rolled out critical new scan functionality in our Adobe Reader mobile apps. In October, we expanded the global footprint for Adobe Document Cloud with the launch of the Adobe Sign service in Japan. In our Digital Marketing segment, Adobe Marketing Cloud is the leader in enabling brands, government agencies and institutions to deliver great digital experiences across devices and channels, whether its financial institutions, retail, travel and entertainment or automotive, entire industries are experiencing digital disruption and aggressively deploying technology to drive stronger brand loyalty and growth. Adobe’s winning formula is built on a unique foundation of content and data, which enables deep customer insights; development and delivery of consistent personalized experiences; and the ability to monitor and optimize business performance in real time. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to be the most comprehensive offering in the exploding Digital Marketing category with best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaigns and data management as well as media optimization. We are seeing strong demand for the Adobe Marketing Cloud across the globe as evidenced by the sold-out crowds at events this quarter in London, Paris, Munich and Tokyo. Major customer wins this quarter included Lufthansa, Pandora, UnitedHealthcare, UPS, U.S. Defense Information Systems Agency and Verizon. In Q4, Adobe managed record 33.5 trillion data transactions, providing us with an unparalleled view into real-time business and cultural trends. Debuting in 2016, the Adobe Digital Price Index has redefined how inflation and consumer goods prices are tracked and measured and has received broad support from the world’s leading economists. Leveraging over 20 billion visits to retail websites, Adobe Digital Insights’ Holiday Shopping Report accurately predicted online sales for this holiday season within a margin of error of less than 0.5%. Adobe measures 80% of all online transactions from the top 100 U.S. retailers and $7.50 out of every $10 spent online with the top 500 U.S. retailers go through Adobe Marketing Cloud. This tremendous volume of data puts Adobe in the unique position to deliver highly accurate, census based online sales totals, pricing and product availability trends each holiday season. Last month, we announced our intention to acquire TubeMogul, a leading demand side video advertising platform, further strengthening our leadership in digital marketing and ad tech. Adobe is currently a leader in search, display and social advertising, planning and delivery with our Adobe Media Optimizer solution. The addition of TubeMogul to our ad tech capabilities will enable Adobe’s customers to maximize their video advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Together, Adobe and TubeMogul will enable our customers to identify the right audience segments and plan, execute and measure paid media performance across any device. We expect the transaction to close in December. In September, we announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to help enterprises embrace digital transformation. Adobe announced it will make Microsoft Azure, the preferred platform for our cloud services, providing customers with a trusted, enterprise grade global platform and that we will integrate our Adobe Marketing Cloud technology with Microsoft’s Dynamics 365 Enterprise and Power BI. Microsoft announced it will make Adobe Marketing Cloud the preferred marketing service for its enterprise customers and its extensive partner and developer ecosystem. Adobe’s success has been a result of our ability to predict the future. While others are jumping on the machine learning and AI bandwagon, these capabilities have been the foundation of our innovation for decades. Our engineers and scientists are squarely focused on harnessing the massive volume of content and data assets captured in our cloud solutions to tackle today’s complex experience challenges. Last month, we announced Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei’s services address the critical demands of our creative document and marketing customers from image matching across millions of images to understanding the meaning and sentiment of digital documents to finally targeting important audience segments. Dozens of these intelligent services have been deployed in our products to-date and we are increasingly significant our investment. We also intend to make Adobe Sensei available to our ecosystem of partners, ISVs and developers. Adobe’s success over the decades is in no small part due to the unique culture we have created. In October, we were named a Best Multinational Workplace by the Great Places to Work Institute and this month, we were among the top 10 employers on Glassdoor’s 2017 List of 50 Best Places to Work. We know that a strong workforce is a diverse workforce and we are committed to increasing diversity among our employee base. We have broken new ground in terms of employee benefits like extended parental leave and are implementing new programs, including youth coding and media making initiatives to inspire future female technologists. Being a good global citizen is important to our employees, customers and investors. For the first time, Adobe has been selected as a component of the prestigious Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. For the third year in a row, we received a perfect score on the 2017 Corporate Equality Index report from the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. In light of these accomplishments, Adobe’s brand momentum has never been stronger and we were honored to be one of the five fastest growing brands on the 2016 Interbrand Best Global Brands ranking. FY ‘16 was a great year for Adobe. We are driving growth in each of the large categories we have created. With a $64 billion total addressable market by 2019, our opportunity has never been greater. Our mission to change the world through digital experiences has never been more relevant and our strategy, our technology and our people set us up for continued success. I would like to thank our employees for their dedication and innovation over the past year. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead. Mark? Mark Garrett Thanks Shantanu. Our earnings report today covers both Q4 and fiscal year 2016 results. In FY ‘16, Adobe achieved record annual revenue of $5.85 billion, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP EPS for the year was $2.32 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.01. This performance is the result of strong execution against our strategy and noteworthy achievements including growing Digital Media ARR by $1.13 billion during the year to exit fiscal 2016 with $4.01 billion, well ahead of our original target of $3.875 billion. Achieving 38% year-over-year revenue growth in our creative business and exiting the year with $3.54 billion of ARR. Delivering Document Cloud revenue of $765 million and growing ARR to $475 million, both of which reflect progress against our goal of migrating this to a subscription business. Achieving record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.63 billion and 20% annual year-over-year growth. Generating $2.2 billion in operating cash flow during the year, which represents 50% year-over-year growth. Growing deferred revenue to $2 billion and increasing our unbilled backlog to approximately $3.4 billion exiting the year. Together, this represents approximately $5.4 billion of contracted revenue that will be recognized over time and returning over $1 billion in cash to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. In the fourth quarter of FY ‘16, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.61 billion, which represents 23% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90. Highlights in the quarter included achieving $316 million of net new Digital Media ARR, record Creative revenue of $886 million, which represent 33% year-over-year growth, record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth, strong growth in operating and net income, record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue and 82% of Q4 revenue from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 23% year-over-year. The addition of 316 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.01 billion exiting Q4. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $886 million, which represents 33% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $283 million during Q4 and exited the quarter with $3.54 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued strong demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter, including net new Creative Cloud subscriptions and enterprise contract renewals and up-sells. Creative Cloud ARPU grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q4. As we outlined at our Analyst Meeting in November, our focus with Creative Cloud continues to be in three key areas growing our core base of users, including migrating the legacy user base of Creative Suite users, addressing piracy and growing our installed base in the education market, driving new customer adoption in adjacent markets with market expansion efforts such as photography plan and using Creative Cloud mobile apps to create awareness and drive new member adoption and growing ARPU and ARR with value expansion services such as Adobe Stock. Some highlights against these goals during the year include 53% year-over-year subscription growth outside the U.S., broadly expanding our base of users by adding more than 1 million Creative Cloud Photography Plan subscribers during the year and growing Adobe Stock revenue by more than 40% year-over-year. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $191 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $475 million, the highest sequential quarterly growth this year. Driving this growth was adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefiting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record quarterly and annual Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue. Entering the year, we targeted approximately 20% Adobe Marketing Cloud annual revenue growth and approximately 30% annual subscription value, or ASV bookings growth. Included in these targets in FY ‘16 was an expectation of approximately $45 million of perpetual revenue. Relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year, we experienced increased demand for on-premise, perpetual licensed solutions by some customers. When we combine ASV bookings for the year with an overachievement in first year value of perpetual contracts, we achieved 30% bookings growth. In Q4, we achieved Marketing Cloud revenue of $465 million, which represents 32% year-over-year growth. With this Q4 performance in FY ‘16, we achieved 20% annual revenue growth. Mobile remains a key driver for this business. Mobile data transactions grew to 55% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $4.5 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY ‘16 versus $3.9 million in hedge gains in Q3 FY ‘16. Thus, the net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $0.3 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $9.1 million. We had $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY ‘16 versus $1.3 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY ‘15. Thus, the net year-over-year currency decreased to revenue considering hedging gains was $2.3 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q4, Adobe’s effective tax rate was 12.5% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP rate was lower than targeted due to tax benefits recognized as the result of the completion of certain income tax audits. Our trade DSO was 47 days, which compares to 47 days in the year ago quarter and 45 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2 billion, up 36% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position was $4.76 billion compared to $4.45 billion at the end of Q3. Cash flow from operations was a record $696 million in the quarter. During this year, we have been using excess domestic cash to buyback stock and reduce our share count. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $331 million. We currently have $500 million remaining under our current authority granted in January 2015. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. Entering FY ‘17, we have great momentum and continue to see strength across our three cloud businesses. We are excited about our large addressable markets and are uniquely positioned to drive strong top line and bottom line growth. At our November 2 Financial Analyst Meeting, we outlined our long-term strategy and provided long-term growth rates and preliminary FY ‘17 financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to operationally execute against those targets and we are reaffirming our long-term FY ‘15 to FY ‘18 financial targets today. Since the Analyst Meeting, the U.S. dollar has strengthened considerably. Were it not for this currency fluctuation, we will be reaffirming all of the preliminary FY ‘17 targets we provided on November 2. Based on today’s FX rates, we believe our hedging programs will effectively mitigate the impact of these rate changes in Q1 and Q2. But if they persist, current FX rates will affect our ability to achieve the preliminary annual targets due to the impact in the second half of FY ‘17. As a result, we are providing the following FY ‘17 targets. We expect total revenue of approximately $6.95 billion, which factoring in the extra week in FY ‘16, represents approximately 21% year-over-year growth. We continue to target Digital Media segment revenue growth of approximately 20%. As you know, we measure ARR on a constant currency basis during a fiscal year, and if necessary, we revalue ARR at year end for the current currency rates. FX rate changes have resulted in a $27 million reduction and an updated Digital Media ARR exiting FY ‘16 of $3.99 billion. The effect of this revision is reflected in our updated investor datasheet and we continue to expect approximately 25% Digital Media ARR growth, which equates to approximately $1 billion of net new ARR in the year leading to approximately $5 billion of Digital Media ARR exiting FY ‘17. By quarter, we expect to add approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1, followed by sequential growth of net new ARR in Q2. Then in Q3, we anticipate a seasonally driven sequential decline followed by strong seasonal growth in the fourth quarter to achieve the target for the year. In Digital Marketing, we continue to target Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth of approximately 20% and Adobe Marketing Cloud ASV bookings growth of approximately 30%. Despite the currency impact, we expect to achieve the same FY ‘17 EPS targets we provided on November 2, which are a GAAP earnings per share of approximately $2.85 and non-GAAP earnings per share targeted at approximately $3.75. During the year, we expect revenue and earnings per share to grow sequentially each quarter with the largest sequential increase in Q4. Starting with FY ‘17, we are providing quarterly estimates for our most likely results rather than providing targeted ranges due to the increased predictability in our business. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.625 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $225 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q1. We expect Digital Media Q1 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 19%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 20%. When comparing Q1 FY ‘17 targets, it is helpful to remember that Q1 FY ‘16 had an extra week due to our 52/53-week fiscal year calendar. Factoring the extra week in Q1 FY ‘16, all Q1 FY ‘17 revenue targets represent greater than 20% year-over-year growth. We are targeting our Q1 share count to be approximately 501 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $13 million on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q1 tax rate of approximately 15% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q1 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.71 and Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.87. Finally, the targets we are providing today do not reflect our planned acquisition of TubeMogul, which we expect to close in December. We plan to issue updated Q1 and annual FY ‘17 financial targets after the acquisition closes. We strongly believe analysts and investors should wait for the close of the acquisition to combine expected results of both companies into an updated model for the coming year. We plan to host a brief call to discuss our strategy and targets that factor in items such as a stub quarter period and accounting implications. In summary, 2016 was another strong year for Adobe. We are the market leader with all three of our cloud solutions and we are executing well against a large and growing addressable market.

Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Ashley with Robert Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Steve Ashley Thanks so much for taking my question. I was going to look at the Creative Media business, you are hitting on all cylinders, I mean the Creative business is strong, you have strengthened education, Document is coming up the curve, I was going to ask about the consumer opportunity there, can you remind us what you have today in consumer and if there is an opportunity to maybe push out and expand how far you are pushing the consumer market in the future? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I am happy to take that, Steve. You are right and thank you for the acknowledgment of how we are executing against the Creative business. From our point of view, Creative Cloud is very much about not just migrating the core customer segment, but significantly through market expansion, making sure that we are targeting new customers. I would point out two or three different initiatives in that space. The first one clearly is Creative Cloud Photography Plan. As you know, we used to have Lightroom and Photoshop Elements, we are increasingly seeing those consumers adopt Creative Cloud Photography Plan. That continues to do really well in terms of the new customer acquisition that we have. Second category that I will talk about are products like Adobe Spark, we are seeing more and more people who have a story to tell, wanting to use Adobe Spark. And I think in this year, you will see that also start to get integrated and folded into the Creative Cloud much like mobile apps are. They represent a big customer acquisition and adoption and migration opportunity. And the third, I have continued to impress upon education. Education as a segment does really well in Creative Cloud. It’s our next-generation or whether it’s K-12 students or higher ed, as they get exposed to our products, clearly as they enter university or the marketplace, they are using our products, all of which we look at as positive trends for the future. Steve Ashley Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Kirk Materne Thanks very much and congrats on a great fiscal year to you all. Shantanu, the last time we met you, it’s right the week before the election and I think there is a lot of folks, wondering what you guys have seen sort of post the results from a macro perspective, I know you guys are sort of operating and serve your own cadence right now through your products and your strategy, but I was just kind of curious, I guess especially in the Digital Marketing world where you guys are obviously talking to a lot of enterprises, is there any change in tone or I guess projected spend or anything like that, I was just curious, if you could give us kind of an update on that? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen Sure. Kirk, I have seen a rally in the stock market as well, which I think all of us have certainly experienced. But in addition to that, I would just continue to emphasize this notion of how all enterprises are being transformed by what’s happening in digital and the urgency with which they really need to think about technology that they can leverage to become more of an experienced business. I think that continues to be unabated. As you saw, we had a pretty strong Q4 revenue growth over 30% year-over-year in the Digital Marketing business. And I think the opportunity continues to be one that we are excited about not just in the U.S. but internationally as well, so nothing that we have seen either just before the election or post election changes are belief in the large opportunity and our continued execution in that space, Kirk. Kirk Materne Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Sterling Auty Yes. Thanks. Hi guys. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned the overage or the higher than expected demand on-premise perpetual in the Digital Marketing side, how much of that happens in the fourth quarter and if you normalize, how would you kind of characterize the bookings and revenue relative to what your expectations were? Shantanu Narayen Sterling, when we look at the entire year first, let me reflect that we continue to think that we both have the most comprehensive offering. And we are pleased with both the revenue and the bookings growth for the year. I do want to clarify that we think the cloud remains the long-term right offering for our customers, but it is a not. The fact that we have an on-premise solution, we continue to think it’s a competitive advantage. And globally, it’s hard to predict which option customers might prefer on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But I want to reiterate, it’s all from our point of view, good revenue. When we look at the different components of revenue in the Marketing Cloud and you look at subscription, which we think is the healthiest long-term predictor and then you look at perpetual and consulting. The subscription bookings revenue grew 29% year-over-year in FY ‘16, so stronger than the overall 20%. And if you actually go back to what Mark showed at the FA meeting and look at the pie chart, it was exactly in line with what we had predicted for Q4. Relative to the beginning of the year to your question, we certainly over achieved a little bit in perpetual revenue relative to subscription bookings. However, when you normalize that and you take given perpetual revenues a multiyear commitment and look at just the first year component, I think it’s really small. And so relative to overall growth, we feel good about it. The mix was slightly different relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. Sterling Auty Got it. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill Thanks. Shantanu, the Asian business has been very strong in the last couple of quarters and I was curious if you could just talk through the fall through that you are seeing there, I know you have also made a bigger push into China where many software companies have not been successful for a lot of reasons, can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing there so far, as you push more aggressively to China? Shantanu Narayen Sure. Brent, I think the two things that we factor in, the first is as we have always stated when we first released Creative Cloud, adoption of Creative Cloud in Asia lagged adoption of Creative Cloud in the U.S. and UK for example, as markets. We now are pleased with the adoption that we are seeing. Australia was always a strong market. Australia continues to be a very strong market. So as it relates to Creative Cloud, as we said even having it in China right now, it was long overdue and the fact that we now have Creative Cloud for teams in China, I think shows our commitment to the Chinese digital economy, which we continue to think is one of the largest, so we feel good about it. The other large opportunity as you know, for us is in the Digital Marketing. And that’s driven by two different phenomena. The first phenomenon is as we increasingly have global agreements with U.S. multinationals, they expect the climate of our solutions, whether it’s in retail, financial services or other places to also be true in China and in India and in Australia and Southeast Asia. So that’s continuing to drive some growth. And then even local companies in all of those markets as they realize mobile in particular there and the digital disruption there. There is excitement around our products. So in Digital Media, it’s all about the adoption of Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing. It’s both about global adoption of our Digital Marketing solutions as well as local companies increasingly recognizing that they have to migrate to digital with mobile being the key driver there. Brent Thill Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Walter Pritchard Thanks. Shantanu, I am wondering if you can talk about the ETLA performance in the fourth quarter and your expectations in terms of ETLA as a part of that $1 billion in incremental ARR next year? And specifically trying to figure out if that – if the new ETLA business is still growing. I know you are kind of coming up on some renewals and so forth there. I just wanted to get a sense of the trajectory? Shantanu Narayen Net summary, Walter, very strong quarter in Q4, I think driven by two different phenomena. The first is 3 years ago when we had first introduced the ETLA program for our customers it was really more a reflection of what they were licensing for Creative Suite. So I would call them more of these custom solutions, which reflected what versions of different products that we are using. Starting in fiscal ‘16, we move to a more complete solution which is people were licensing all of the products and the fact that it was integrated. The field organization did a really great job of articulating the benefits of moving to the entire complete solution. And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete and clearly resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY ‘17. Walter Pritchard Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shankar Iyer Hi, this is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on your overall margin profile as you look into the next few years. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the increased investment that you are going to make in Sensei and Adobe Spark and whole lot of other products. But if you also look at the large down potential and the potential that as your partnership that can drive your Marketing Cloud and also your margins down over time, what’s the leverage in the model and can we expect an operating margin to be in the 40% to 45% range there by the end of the decade? Mark Garrett Hey, it’s Mark. Thanks for the question. I am glad I got one. I was getting ready to go home. So first, we are extremely proud of our ability to be one of the only, if not the only cloud companies that can grow significantly on top line and bottom line and the fact that we got to $3.01 this year and being well ahead of our guidance is something that we are very proud of. We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year’s guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you are going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for ‘18. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I am not going to say at this point that we are going to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008, but you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model and we feel very good about that. Shankar Iyer Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stan Zlotsky Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith Weiss. So, I actually wanted to ask a question on the Document Services business, the ARR that you added in Q4 was very impressive. You guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks, the fastest and the most that you have added all year, so what was the driver of that outperformance in the quarter? And more broadly, as you moved the Document Services business to subscription, how are you thinking about that versus the kind of strategy that you adopted moving to Creative Cloud business to subscription as well? So, thank you. Shantanu Narayen Yes, I think two comments come to mind there. First is it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment, ARR, it probably under-represents the momentum that we have with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they are using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we are seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality where it’s I would say one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation I think in that space just reflects as paper to digital is this macro trend. We are very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that. Mike Saviage Next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. Mark, don’t go home yet. I have a question for you. So the question concerns cash flow. Mike Saviage Jay, it’s Mike. I am glad you are in our call, not the Oracle call like others. Thanks. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay, you are very welcome. So, you just grew your GAAP operating cash flow by about $800 million in ‘16. And the question is how are you thinking about cash flow in ‘17? Do you think you could achieve a similar increment even considering all the investments of course that you are talking about, particularly in terms of geographic expansion in Asia, and of course, R&D? Mark Garrett Yes, Jay. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we had extremely strong cash flow on the year, really good cash flow in Q4. As I look into next year, I expect very strong cash flow again. I will say, I am glad you asked the question, I will say just so everybody understands cash flow from Q4 to Q1 always naturally declines. We have a lot of payments that get made in the first quarter for commissions and bonuses and things like that. So you should expect a pretty substantial decline just sequentially, but I do fully expect another strong cash flow year next year. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, could you talk about perhaps the non net income components of that? I mean, how are you thinking in terms, for example, of deferred in particular? Mark Garrett Again, I expect deferred to continue to increase as we drive bookings faster than we are driving revenue. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay, good. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan Thanks for taking my question. Mark, when we look at ARR, big picture I guess is that we added about $1.1 billion this year, ‘16, about the same level as fiscal ‘15. We are talking about $1 billion in ‘17, so there is really very little decay in the rate of new ARR being added. And I know you are not yet talking about the year even further out. But how should we be thinking about that kind of pace of moderation shall we see in that ARR increment? And the question really goes to this sort of notion of where we are both in terms of new user adds and base transition? I am just curious to just your high level thoughts. Mark Garrett I mean, we have – like you say, we have been consistently adding around $1 billion. And we feel very good about that number. We continue to attract new users. We continue to drive higher ARPU. We are getting people off of promotions on to full price. We are adding value-add services like Stock, all of those things help drive that ARR number. Retention helps drive that ARR number. So, there is lots of different ways that we can do that. And as you know, we are addressing a much bigger TAM than we were addressing a number of years ago. So all of that plays into our ability, we believe to continue to drive that kind of net new ARR. Ross MacMillan And then just one other just follow-up quickly, just on the seasonality of ARR this year, I think this will be the first year where we actually see decline in fiscal Q3. Is that just the base effect like the numbers are getting bigger, are there any particular things this year we should think about as we transition Q2 to Q3 that maybe we didn’t see last year or the prior year? Mark Garrett Yes, there is nothing new. We are just trying to make sure we incorporate seasonality. I mean Q3 is a slower seasonal quarter for buying for us and we just want to factor that in. Ross MacMillan Okay, thanks again. Congratulations. Shantanu Narayen Thank you. Mark Garrett Thanks Ross. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Wieser Thanks for taking the question. Following the TubeMogul acquisition, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about any other aspects of that type you think you maybe emphasizing investment in whether internal or external and may be relatedly, Tube made a pretty strong focus as an independent company on the demand side orientation, given the business you have on Primetime, I am wondering if you expect it will have some supply side orientation as well? Shantanu Narayen I think at this point Brian, what I would say is we are excited about the TubeMogul acquisition. And we are excited about the long-term video as well as data opportunity. Just to highlight from our point of view, TubeMogul enables – it’s more heft in our Ad Tech platform, which is a key part of as we are targeting the CMO or the Chief Revenue Officer or the Chief Digital Officer at an enterprise and adding to what we have in display, search and social, so that’s good. To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what’s perhaps more strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMV, we are seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry leading audience manager DMV. That has really become in fiscal ‘16, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers. And to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have. So excited about it and we will say more about that after we close. Brian Wieser Great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Cogan Thanks. It’s Jack Cogan filling in for Heather. So you mentioned Creative Cloud ARPU continues to grow sequentially, I just wondered if you could rank order the drivers behind this, I know you mentioned that users on promo pricing, renewing at full price, new offerings like Stock, maybe if you can just put into context what sort of the biggest drivers are and how long we should expect a tailwind like the promo users renewing at full price to exist? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen All of them are clearly driving the transition of the business to ARR. I would say people are migrating off of the promotional pricing. And as long as they continue to retain to full price, that’s certainly one of the large drivers. I think we talked about enterprise as one of the large drivers. The mix as it moves from single app to complete is another driver. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And that’s why our strategy of getting more and more people on to the platform, we actually did fewer promotions in the quarter, they were more targeted promotions, so they were successful. And that gives you some color, I think. Stock and Sign are starting to become reasonable ARR and we expect continued growth in both those areas as well. Jack Cogan Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on the last one, so some recent survey work that we have done suggest that the majority of enterprises have yet to upgrade to Windows 10, but they plan to do so within the next 12 months to 24 months, so I am just curious, how much of the as yet converted suite days is running Windows versus iOS and do you expect because I didn’t hear you mention in the last answer that those Windows 10 upgrades would drive some of the ARR growth in fiscal ‘17? Shantanu Narayen I think big picture, what I would say in that particular space is whenever there are hardware transitions or software transitions with significant new functionality, they always represent opportunities for us to accelerate migration. When people look at Windows in particular, I think what’s most exciting to them is in addition to the incredible hardware that Microsoft and other companies are doing, the fact that it’s touch-enabled, has really made a very significant difference. Video capabilities also in that platform are just so powerful that there is clearly migration from the high end proprietary video systems into PCs, so that hopefully gives you some color. I think Apple continues to innovate. But with Windows 10, as people migrate, it always is an opportunity for us to work with that transition team, to make sure that they also migrate to Creative Cloud. Michael Nemeroff Thank you very much. Mike Saviage Operator, we are coming up on to the top of the hour. Why don’t we take one more question? Operator Your last question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samad Samana Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. I apologize if my question has already been asked. I jumped on late. But could you give us any idea, you gave that 1 million use of Photoshop subs that you added on your photography package, maybe any color on just what the full year trend looks like for full Creative Cloud adds and if there is any change in either the retention rate that you saw there or the add-on rates for the Adobe Stock package that the Creative Cloud packs that included Stock? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen I think with respect to both the addition of subs as well as the migration of the business, all of them just continue to be really powerful. If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core Creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes – if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it’s also higher than 80%. So as we look at retention, it’s actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we are pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. Shantanu Narayen And since that was the last question, for me my summary remarks would be while FY ‘16 was clearly a great year, in many ways I am even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the two big areas of focus for Adobe empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represent massive opportunities in our content and data platform really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we are innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth. I would like to thank our customers, partners, employees and investors and wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us. Mike Saviage And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.

And the second thing that actually happened in the year was also true-ups, which is people are finding that as they are deploying more and more of Creative Cloud, they were volunteering during true-ups so new logos as well as moving from what I would say, custom to complete and clearly resulting in an increase in ARPU for the enterprise. And we continue to believe that, that represents a large opportunity in the U.S. and internationally for FY ‘17. Walter Pritchard Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Shankar Iyer Hi, this is Shankar on behalf of Kash. I have a question on your overall margin profile as you look into the next few years. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about the increased investment that you are going to make in Sensei and Adobe Spark and whole lot of other products. But if you also look at the large down potential and the potential that as your partnership that can drive your Marketing Cloud and also your margins down over time, what’s the leverage in the model and can we expect an operating margin to be in the 40% to 45% range there by the end of the decade? Mark Garrett Hey, it’s Mark. Thanks for the question. I am glad I got one. I was getting ready to go home. So first, we are extremely proud of our ability to be one of the only, if not the only cloud companies that can grow significantly on top line and bottom line and the fact that we got to $3.01 this year and being well ahead of our guidance is something that we are very proud of. We do have room in the model to invest in the businesses that we need to invest in. And if you look at next year’s guidance and you do the P&L based on what we just told you, you are going to come up with operating margins that are increasing by around a point from this year, so from 34% to 35%. We gave you guidance for ‘18. You can see that margins continue to improve from there. I am not going to say at this point that we are going to go back to 40%, which is where we were in 2008, but you can see that there is still tremendous leverage in our model and we feel very good about that. Shankar Iyer Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Stan Zlotsky Hey, guys. Good afternoon. This is Stan Zlotsky sitting in for Keith Weiss. So, I actually wanted to ask a question on the Document Services business, the ARR that you added in Q4 was very impressive. You guys had mentioned in your prepared remarks, the fastest and the most that you have added all year, so what was the driver of that outperformance in the quarter? And more broadly, as you moved the Document Services business to subscription, how are you thinking about that versus the kind of strategy that you adopted moving to Creative Cloud business to subscription as well? So, thank you. Shantanu Narayen Yes, I think two comments come to mind there. First is it was a very strong year. And if you look at just the Document Cloud segment, ARR, it probably under-represents the momentum that we have with the Document Cloud and Acrobat businesses because as you know, significant number of people also use Acrobat DC when they are using the Creative Cloud. So big picture, it was driven by both the adobe.com where we have very dramatically made the switch from people buying the perpetual product to people buying the subscription offering as well as enterprise and the adoption of new services like Adobe Sign. And so when you look at the ARR, I think the ARR growth was over 20% for the year. And when you think about the unit growth that we are seeing in it, it just reflects that PDF as a standard has continued to be the win, which people share it. For those on the call, I would also really recommend, you try out our new mobile apps and the scan functionality where it’s I would say one of the easiest ways for people to create a PDF out of any picture that they might have using the camera. So continued innovation I think in that space just reflects as paper to digital is this macro trend. We are very uniquely positioned to capitalize on that. Mike Saviage Next question, please. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jay Vleeschhouwer Thank you. Mark, don’t go home yet. I have a question for you. So the question concerns cash flow. Mike Saviage Jay, it’s Mike. I am glad you are in our call, not the Oracle call like others. Thanks. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay, you are very welcome. So, you just grew your GAAP operating cash flow by about $800 million in ‘16. And the question is how are you thinking about cash flow in ‘17? Do you think you could achieve a similar increment even considering all the investments of course that you are talking about, particularly in terms of geographic expansion in Asia, and of course, R&D? Mark Garrett Yes, Jay. Thanks for the question. Obviously, we had extremely strong cash flow on the year, really good cash flow in Q4. As I look into next year, I expect very strong cash flow again. I will say, I am glad you asked the question, I will say just so everybody understands cash flow from Q4 to Q1 always naturally declines. We have a lot of payments that get made in the first quarter for commissions and bonuses and things like that. So you should expect a pretty substantial decline just sequentially, but I do fully expect another strong cash flow year next year. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, could you talk about perhaps the non net income components of that? I mean, how are you thinking in terms, for example, of deferred in particular? Mark Garrett Again, I expect deferred to continue to increase as we drive bookings faster than we are driving revenue. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay, good. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ross MacMillan Thanks for taking my question. Mark, when we look at ARR, big picture I guess is that we added about $1.1 billion this year, ‘16, about the same level as fiscal ‘15. We are talking about $1 billion in ‘17, so there is really very little decay in the rate of new ARR being added. And I know you are not yet talking about the year even further out. But how should we be thinking about that kind of pace of moderation shall we see in that ARR increment? And the question really goes to this sort of notion of where we are both in terms of new user adds and base transition? I am just curious to just your high level thoughts. Mark Garrett I mean, we have – like you say, we have been consistently adding around $1 billion. And we feel very good about that number. We continue to attract new users. We continue to drive higher ARPU. We are getting people off of promotions on to full price. We are adding value-add services like Stock, all of those things help drive that ARR number. Retention helps drive that ARR number. So, there is lots of different ways that we can do that. And as you know, we are addressing a much bigger TAM than we were addressing a number of years ago. So all of that plays into our ability, we believe to continue to drive that kind of net new ARR. Ross MacMillan And then just one other just follow-up quickly, just on the seasonality of ARR this year, I think this will be the first year where we actually see decline in fiscal Q3. Is that just the base effect like the numbers are getting bigger, are there any particular things this year we should think about as we transition Q2 to Q3 that maybe we didn’t see last year or the prior year? Mark Garrett Yes, there is nothing new. We are just trying to make sure we incorporate seasonality. I mean Q3 is a slower seasonal quarter for buying for us and we just want to factor that in. Ross MacMillan Okay, thanks again. Congratulations. Shantanu Narayen Thank you. Mark Garrett Thanks Ross. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brian Wieser with Pivotal Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brian Wieser Thanks for taking the question. Following the TubeMogul acquisition, I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about any other aspects of that type you think you maybe emphasizing investment in whether internal or external and may be relatedly, Tube made a pretty strong focus as an independent company on the demand side orientation, given the business you have on Primetime, I am wondering if you expect it will have some supply side orientation as well? Shantanu Narayen I think at this point Brian, what I would say is we are excited about the TubeMogul acquisition. And we are excited about the long-term video as well as data opportunity. Just to highlight from our point of view, TubeMogul enables – it’s more heft in our Ad Tech platform, which is a key part of as we are targeting the CMO or the Chief Revenue Officer or the Chief Digital Officer at an enterprise and adding to what we have in display, search and social, so that’s good. To your point, we do have now more end-to-end capabilities all the way from video delivery to monetization for our publisher as well as our advertiser customers. And I think what’s perhaps more strategic, the integration between their DSV offering and our DMV, we are seeing more and more people wanting to integrate with our industry leading audience manager DMV. That has really become in fiscal ‘16, a driver of the adoption of the platform. And so I think our goal when this closes, will be to share more about what we are planning to do strategically. But big picture, it just enables us to be more of a trusted platform for the Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Revenue Officers. And to enable both personalization in terms of delivery and better segmentation in deriving value from all of the data that they have. So excited about it and we will say more about that after we close. Brian Wieser Great. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jack Cogan Thanks. It’s Jack Cogan filling in for Heather. So you mentioned Creative Cloud ARPU continues to grow sequentially, I just wondered if you could rank order the drivers behind this, I know you mentioned that users on promo pricing, renewing at full price, new offerings like Stock, maybe if you can just put into context what sort of the biggest drivers are and how long we should expect a tailwind like the promo users renewing at full price to exist? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen All of them are clearly driving the transition of the business to ARR. I would say people are migrating off of the promotional pricing. And as long as they continue to retain to full price, that’s certainly one of the large drivers. I think we talked about enterprise as one of the large drivers. The mix as it moves from single app to complete is another driver. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color. And that’s why our strategy of getting more and more people on to the platform, we actually did fewer promotions in the quarter, they were more targeted promotions, so they were successful. And that gives you some color, I think. Stock and Sign are starting to become reasonable ARR and we expect continued growth in both those areas as well. Jack Cogan Thank you. Operator [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nemeroff with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Michael Nemeroff Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just building on the last one, so some recent survey work that we have done suggest that the majority of enterprises have yet to upgrade to Windows 10, but they plan to do so within the next 12 months to 24 months, so I am just curious, how much of the as yet converted suite days is running Windows versus iOS and do you expect because I didn’t hear you mention in the last answer that those Windows 10 upgrades would drive some of the ARR growth in fiscal ‘17? Shantanu Narayen I think big picture, what I would say in that particular space is whenever there are hardware transitions or software transitions with significant new functionality, they always represent opportunities for us to accelerate migration. When people look at Windows in particular, I think what’s most exciting to them is in addition to the incredible hardware that Microsoft and other companies are doing, the fact that it’s touch-enabled, has really made a very significant difference. Video capabilities also in that platform are just so powerful that there is clearly migration from the high end proprietary video systems into PCs, so that hopefully gives you some color. I think Apple continues to innovate. But with Windows 10, as people migrate, it always is an opportunity for us to work with that transition team, to make sure that they also migrate to Creative Cloud. Michael Nemeroff Thank you very much. Mike Saviage Operator, we are coming up on to the top of the hour. Why don’t we take one more question? Operator Your last question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Samad Samana Hi. Thanks for taking my question and squeezing me in. I apologize if my question has already been asked. I jumped on late. But could you give us any idea, you gave that 1 million use of Photoshop subs that you added on your photography package, maybe any color on just what the full year trend looks like for full Creative Cloud adds and if there is any change in either the retention rate that you saw there or the add-on rates for the Adobe Stock package that the Creative Cloud packs that included Stock? Thank you. Shantanu Narayen I think with respect to both the addition of subs as well as the migration of the business, all of them just continue to be really powerful. If I had to give you a little bit of color as it relates to what happened in retention, I think in 2011 when we first outlined the opportunities, we estimated at that point that even at 80% retention rates for the core Creative it would be great for the business. Clearly, retention for the core Creative is higher than that. And in fact, for the entire base, that includes – if you could mute your line also, that would be great. Thank you. And so what I said was where retention for the core Creative is really higher than that. And when you think about it for the entire base that includes consumers, it’s also higher than 80%. So as we look at retention, it’s actually a very good indicator of the core health of the business. And we are pleased with that. With respect to the Creative Cloud Photography Plan, it just continues to be a very vibrant way for us to attract new customers to our particular platform. Shantanu Narayen And since that was the last question, for me my summary remarks would be while FY ‘16 was clearly a great year, in many ways I am even more excited about the long-term opportunities that we have created for ourselves as a company. When we think about the two big areas of focus for Adobe empowering people to create and transforming how businesses compete, it just represent massive opportunities in our content and data platform really allow us to uniquely address this need. On the Creative business, just continuing to enable any individual who has a story to tell, to tell them across any medium, any device. And on the enterprise side, enabling them to leverage technology to reinvent themselves as an experienced business, represent large unmet needs. I feel good that we are innovating while staying in an extremely select group of people and companies that are delivering impressive both top line and bottom line growth. I would like to thank our customers, partners, employees and investors and wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you for joining us. Mike Saviage And this concludes our call. Thanks everyone.

Shantanu Narayen Thanks Mike and good afternoon. Adobe had an outstanding first quarter with record revenue of $1.68 billion and record profit, GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.94. We continue to execute well against our strategy, and are driving momentum across our entire business. Digital transformation has created a tailwind for Adobe among a diverse spectrum of customers in a broad number of industries, from students, to designers, to the public sector, and the world’s largest brands. Once the domain solely of professionals, today everyone is a creator; from the teenager doing a school photography project; to the small business owner, prototyping her Web site to the film-maker; working on his first documentary; and designers become a critical element in the fabric of our lives. Design is the starting point for every connection we make, and great design requires innovative technology. At the same time, massive amounts of data, the proliferation of devices and skyrocketing customer expectations, are forcing enterprises to completely rethink their business strategies. To forge stronger customer connections that lead to brand loyalty and growth, forward-looking enterprises are reimagining the experience they provide to their customers. At Adobe, we’ve have always known that a great customer experience is the differentiator that separates market leaders from the pack. At the center of every great experience are customer intelligence and amazing design, and these are Adobe’s core competencies. Our mission to help our customers design and deliver great experiences has never been more relevant as is reflected in our outstanding Q1 results. In Digital Media, we continue to be the undisputed leader in helping customers inject creativity into their jobs, schoolwork and their daily lives. We achieved a record $1.14 billion in Digital Media revenue in Q1 and exited the quarter with over $4.25 billion of Digital Media annualized recurring revenue, or ARR. The net ARR increase in Q1 was $265 million, and was driven by continued strength in our Creative Cloud business. Creative Cloud is the one-stop shop for creatives the world over and we continue to execute against our strategy of migrating CS customers, expanding into new market segments, and adding value through new services. In Q1, Creative Cloud ARR growth was driven by strong performance in the SMB segment with our Creative Cloud teams offering and international growth, as well as strong retention of existing subscribers. This year, two of Adobe’s iconic creative apps are celebrating anniversaries. In March, Adobe Illustrator, the industry-standard vector graphics app that lets you create logos, typography, and complex illustrations for print, web, video, and mobile, celebrated its 30th anniversary. 30 years of Illustrator projects are visible everywhere across the world, from billboards on U.S. highways to magazine covers in Tokyo. More than 180 million graphics are created monthly with Illustrator. Earlier this week, we celebrated Premiere Pro’s 25th anniversary. Premiere Pro is the world’s leading video production solution, and continues to grow its footprint across every video segment. Premiere Pro was the official editing tool of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival in January. Premiere Pro’s virtual reality workflows are seeing strong adoption with the majority of the films in the Virtual Reality category at Sundance having used it in their creative process. As part of our year-long celebration, we are partnering with the Grammy-award-winning band, Imagine Dragons, which just released the music video for its newest song, Believer. Earlier this week, we announced that creatives in 27 countries will have the chance to take the raw video footage from the original video and cut their own version. Our Adobe Stock service business continues to accelerate. In the past year, we have grown Adobe Stock assets to more than 60 million and in January, we announced a partnership with 500px, a global online photography community, which expands Adobe Stock’s Premium collection. The world’s leading digital document service, Adobe Document Cloud enables businesses to reinvent inefficient paper-based processes. In Q1, Document Cloud revenue was $196 million and we grew Document Cloud ARR to $493 million. Acrobat units across Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud combined, again grew double-digits year-over-year. This achievement was driven by new customer acquisition with our subscription model and the funnel of users created by the broad use of PDF and the proliferation of Adobe Reader across mobile devices. In February, in conjunction with the Cloud Signature Consortium, we unveiled the world’s first open cloud-based digital signature standard, available in any browser and on any device. We announced new functionality in Adobe Sign that enables users to create end-to-end business workflows, such as advanced document routing, online collaboration and Microsoft SharePoint integration. Adobe Sign now includes mobile tools, powered by Adobe Sensei, for scanning, reading, routing and signing documents. Deep intelligence fueled by trillions of data transactions are the foundation of our Digital Marketing business. We drove a record $477 million in Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue in Q1, which was 26% year-over-year revenue growth. Adobe Marketing Cloud continues to lead the category and be the most comprehensive offering for global brands, government agencies and institutions that need to deliver personal, consistent and relevant experiences to their audiences everywhere and every time they connect with them. Adobe Marketing Cloud features best-in-class solutions in analytics, content management, cross-channel campaign management and media optimization. We managed more than 100 trillion data transactions on behalf of our customers over the past year across our Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions. In February, Gartner recognized Adobe as a leader in its 2017 Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs research report. For the third consecutive time, Adobe was ranked the highest in completeness of vision axis among the 22 companies that were evaluated. Also in Q1, Adobe was recognized as a Leader in the Forrester Wave report on Web Content Management systems, receiving the highest score. Thanks to the completeness of our offering, our continued innovation and our growing partner network, we continue to see strong market momentum, with major customer wins this quarter at Dick’s Sporting Goods, Mercy Health, Hutchison UK, Autotrader.com, Computer Sciences Corporation, ADT and the University of Michigan. In December, we completed our acquisition of TubeMogul, a leader in demand-side video advertising. We achieved strong Q1 TubeMogul revenue, and we are hard at work integrating TubeMogul with our current Adobe Media Optimizer solution. As a combined advertising solution, we will enable Adobe’s customers to optimize their video, search and display advertising investments across desktop, mobile, streaming devices and TV. Next week in Las Vegas, we will conduct our largest Adobe Summit ever, with more than 12,000 attendees, including more than 1,000 of our global partners. Executives from top brands, including the NBA, National Geographic, T-Mobile and Facebook will take the stage and we’ll give an update on our strategic partnership with Microsoft. We’re continuing to aggressively invest in the Adobe Cloud Platform and Adobe Sensei, our unified artificial intelligence and machine learning framework and intelligent services. Our trillions of content and data assets, along with our deep category expertise in the markets we serve, give Adobe Sensei a unique ability to help customers tackle complex experience challenges. We plan to unveil new Adobe Sensei capabilities at Adobe Summit. We will also provide an update on our adobe.io capabilities for partners, ISVs and developers, who can utilize our open platform to develop their own applications. This level of innovation can only come from talented, creative and dedicated employees. Last month, we held our internal Tech Summit where we announced our commitment to train every one of our technical employees in artificial intelligence fundamentals. We also demonstrated the incredible work happening across the Company. Last month, we were included on Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies list, and last week we were honored to be named to the Fortune Best Places to Work list for the 17th year. Adobe would not be the Company it is today without our rich diversity of employees, and that continued diversity is vital to our future. I would like to thank all our employees for the role they play in our continued success. To create an exceptional customer experience, you need a potent combination of deep intelligence and amazing design. These are our unique capabilities, and our opportunity has never been greater. We have the technology leadership, partner ecosystem and customer relationships, to fundamentally reshape how individuals, brands and institutions transform themselves in the 21st century. Q1 was a great start to what we believe will be another great year for Adobe. Mark? Mark Garrett Thanks, Shantanu. In the first quarter of FY17, Adobe achieved record revenue of $1.68 billion dollars, which represents 22% year-over-year growth. GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $0.80 and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.94. When comparing Q1 FY17 and Q1 FY16 results, it is helpful to remember that our year-ago quarter had an extra week due to Adobe’s 52/53 week fiscal year calendar. Factoring in the extra week a year ago in Q1 FY16, year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter was greater than 25%. Highlights in Q1 included; achieving $265 million of net new Digital Media ARR; record Creative revenue of $942 million; record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million; strong year-over-year growth in operating income and net income; record cash flow from operations and deferred revenue; and 85% of Q1 revenue came from recurring sources. In Digital Media, we grew segment revenue by 22% year-over-year. The addition of $265 million net new Digital Media ARR during the quarter grew total Digital Media ARR to $4.25 billion exiting Q1. Within Digital Media, we delivered Creative revenue of $942 million, which represents 29% year-over-year growth. In addition, we increased Creative ARR by $244 million during Q1 and exited the quarter with $3.76 billion of Creative ARR. Driving the momentum with our Creative business was continued demand for Creative Cloud across all offerings and routes to market during the quarter. Q1 ARR performance was driven by strong subscription adoption and retention; strength with Creative Cloud for teams, particularly in Europe; and continued growth with Adobe Stock. Creative Cloud ARPU was either steady or grew quarter-over-quarter across all offerings in Q1. With Document Cloud, we achieved revenue of $196 million. Document Cloud ARR grew to $493 million exiting Q1. Driving this growth was continued adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and value-add services, such as Adobe Sign, both of which are benefitting ARR and building a foundation for revenue growth in the future. In Digital Marketing, we achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $477 million, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. TubeMogul added $32 million of revenue in Q1, which was $13 million above our target of $19 million. Approximately $10 million of the upside was due to some of the TubeMogul revenue being recognized on a gross basis in the quarter rather than on a net basis. Excluding the extra $10 million of gross TubeMogul revenue, year-over-year Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue growth was 24%, which was in line with our Q1 target. As we discussed on our TubeMogul conference call in January, we intend to recognize TubeMogul revenue on a net basis. Due to some ongoing contractual commitments, there will be some small gross revenue amounts through year-end. Mobile remains a key driver for our Marketing Cloud business; mobile data transactions grew to 56% of total Adobe Analytics transactions in the quarter. Total data transactions in Q1 grew to $41.3 trillion, and in the trailing four quarters, data transactions with our Marketing Cloud solutions exceeded $100 trillion. From a quarter-over-quarter currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $14.8 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $8.1 million in hedge gains in Q4 FY16; thus a net sequential currency decrease to revenue considering hedging gains was $4.7 million. From a year-over-year currency perspective, FX decreased revenue by $11.9 million. We had $18.3 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY17 versus $3.2 million in hedge gains in Q1 FY16; thus the net year-over-year currency increase to revenue considering hedging gains was $3.2 million. We experienced stable demand across all major geographies during the quarter. In Q1, Adobe’s effective tax rate was 13.5% on a GAAP-basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. The Q1 GAAP rate was slightly lower than targeted due to Adobe’s adoption of the new accounting standard affecting taxes related to equity-based costs. Our trade DSO was 46 days, which compares to 42 days in the year-ago quarter, and 47 days last quarter. Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.06 billion, up 28% year-over-year. Our ending cash and short-term investment position exiting Q1 was $4.65 billion. Cash flow from operations was a record $730 million in the quarter. In Q1, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at a cost of $238 million. We have $300 million remaining under the January 2015 authority, after which we will begin repurchases under our new $2.5 billion authority granted in January 2017. Now, I will provide our financial outlook. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we are targeting revenue of approximately $1.73 billion. We expect to achieve approximately $290 million of net new Digital Media ARR in Q2, which represents both sequential and year-over-year growth in net new ARR achievement. We expect Digital Media Q2 segment year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 24%, and Adobe Marketing Cloud year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 26%. We are targeting our Q2 share count to be approximately 499 million shares. We expect net non-operating expense to be approximately $15 million on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We are targeting a Q2 tax rate of approximately 24% on a GAAP basis and 21% on a non-GAAP basis. These targets yield a Q2 GAAP earnings per share target of approximately $0.66, and Q2 non-GAAP earnings per share of approximately $0.94. In summary, Q1 was an amazing start to what we believe will be another record year for Adobe. We remain bullish about our prospects for the rest of the year and beyond. Mike?

And we ask that you limit your questions to one per person. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Kash Rangan Mark, I hate to bring this up but, AC 606, a lot of companies are starting to give it a little thought. I’m wondering if you could give us your perspective on how it would that change the revenue recognition in the Marketing Cloud and also the expense recognition? Thank you so much. Mark Garrett You’ll see that we’ve written some disclosure in our SEC filings on this. The standard, as you know, is effective for Adobe in the first quarter of 2019. So, we have quite a bit of time until it goes effective for us. We don’t plan early adopt that we haven’t selected a transition method yet. We’re clearly evaluating the effect and the standard, and what it will do some revenue for us. We expect that revenue related to professional services in our cloud offerings, or enterprise individual and teams, would remain substantially unchanged. But again, we’re in the process of evaluating that. And as it relates to, what we would call more of an ETLA, a term-based license where software and maintenance are bundle together. Those are the arrangements that will like have some impact from the standard. But again, we have until 2019 to work through that. And as you know, we’re now selling the full could solution to the enterprise. So, that’s where we stand as of today. But clearly, more work to do and lots more time. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with J. P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Sterling Auty On the Creative Cloud side, the growth of momentum continues to be strong. But can you give us a little more at least qualitative color as to the drivers of it. How much of it might be something you’re doing on price and managing promotions? How much are you adding new customers, and how much of it is deeper penetration into existing customers? Shantanu Narayen Sterling, I’ll take that question. I think we’re continuing to seeing good strength across each of the groups, particularly as it relates to Q1. We saw some good SMB, small and medium business, demand that continues to do well. As you know that’s the team offering, which is a higher price point offering. And especially in EMEA, we had a good quarter. I would say, Acrobat, had strong unit quarter that’s reflected both in Creative Cloud, as well as in Document Cloud. In addition to that, we continue to see good progress on retention. And so, as people migrate off the performance or the promotional pricing and get on to the full plans; and then new unit adoption, as well for the new offerings, especially the photography solution; and international continue to do well. And also, there is no question that we’re combating piracy as the ability to get boxes in most countries diminishes. So, I would say across the spectrum of the different offerings. And from an ARPU point of view, as well Sterling, I think Mark mentioned that in his prepared remarks. So, that continues to be strong as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Alex Zukin Shantanu, I wanted to ask a bigger picture question for you about what you’re seeing in terms of the growth of front-office budgets. And maybe what change you’ve observed this year, or at least start this year from, maybe the last year and the year before that. And how is that driving a change in kind of -- is that accelerating your visionary way because it seems like the shift of the digital transformation budget to the importance of the CEO level has really accelerated; so just curious to get your thoughts on that. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. I think big picture, the conversations that we’re having day-in and day-out, our enterprises recognizing that digital is transforming their agenda. And then they decompose that into what are the key things that they have to do in order to use that as an opportunity rather than a challenge. And clearly from our point of view, the engagement that they do with their customers or how they deliver their experience continues to be we think one of the key ways in which people make digital tailwind rather than a headwind. And we're part of all of those conversations. I think if you talk to also the consulting companies, they're being brought in to aspirationally help all of these companies, rethink their business model processes and people. But top of the agenda for even the CEO and the CIO and CFO, is what are we doing with respect to delivering a better engaging customer experience? Next week at Summit, we'll talk a little bit more about how that expands on our vision or what we can do, and what people are asking to step up and do. But I think the way it manifests itself in the business is people are saying if it's just so key to my future, I want to bet and standardize on companies that have a comprehensive platform, which is why we're always pleased to see us being rated as the number one platform that exists for this kind of technology solution. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Walter Pritchard I heard your response Shantanu on the question around demand drivers. I'm wondering if you can just talk about ARPU, specifically as a driver in fiscal '17 and beyond. In addition to like your commentary around stock suggested that you were seeing more of an uptick there, and you have things like Sensei and so forth that are incremental to the product that you're delivering in the market. Can you help us understand how much more of a driver ARPU is versus what it’s been over the last several years in this transition? Shantanu Narayen Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise. As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs. And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new. And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past. As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services. So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services. And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well. To your point, stock had a good quarter. We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory. Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding. And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value. And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini Shantanu, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the success of Creative Cloud impact the adoption of the marketing suites. And I know that's been one of your goals that one could help drive the other. But have you seen any change in the ability for you being the industry standard for Creative, start to impact the Marketing Cloud side of the business? And has the messaging with customer and the receptivity started to -- have you seen any noticeable difference over the last 12 months? Shantanu Narayen It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise. There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it’s ever been. So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits. I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us. And the expectation is that’s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery. So, we’re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, it’s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan Mark, I didn’t see any commentary on fiscal ’17 guidance. I’m just curious, I guess specifically, about how you are thinking on the 1 billion ARR target, given the strength in Q1 and your guide for Q2, which is certainly above our number. Mark Garrett Clearly, from our perspective, the business is performing exceptionally well. We had a great Q1 across all the key metrics. And to your point, we provided we think are strong Q2 targets. If you remember back, we’ve guided FY ’17 the first time at Analyst Day back in November of last year. We updated it again in December with Q4 earnings. We updated it once more in January for TubeMogul. And we just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance so frequently. So, we’re very happy with the first quarter. We’re very pleased with what we were able to do from a guidance perspective on Q2. Clearly, we’ve got momentum. We just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance that frequently. Ross MacMillan And then one just quick one, just looking at Q2 guide it implies, at least I think in our model that operating margins maybe are down a little bit sequentially. And I know we have a little bit of an extra three weeks, I think from Tube. But are there any other factors for us to think about in terms of OpEx this quarter, Summit or anything else that’s unusual? Thanks. Mark Garrett Our salary increases kick-in for the Company and that has an effect on Q2 from a cost perspective. You’ll see that every year. We continue to hire and invest in the Company. Again, we feel great about our performance in Q1 and our ability to drive leverage in the model going forward. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss On the Marketing Cloud side, you talked about and there’s Gartner Magic Quadrant that came out during the quarter, and I think Forrester Wave. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment? Are any of the surround guys or any of the big guys like the Microsoft or the Oracle of the world getting more competitive in that Marketing Cloud field for you guys? And then on as a follow up, any initial gains or any initial benefits you guys are seeing from Microsoft relationship in FY17? Shantanu Narayen Let me take the second first, which is, you’ll get an update as well as Summit. So we’re hoping a lot of will be at Summit. I think you’ll be pleased with how quickly we’ve been able to integrate the products. And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven. Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics. And I think the team has done a great job. But next week we’ll give you a little bit of an update on that. On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about. This is a $40 billion TAM. Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity. But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that we’re strong continues to be excellent. I think we have a differentiated solution. And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader. But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer Question for Mark, as you know, I am particularly interested in your gross margin structure and the various components of that. You had a couple of dichotomous outcomes in Q1 expect to cost revenue the graphic you addressed. You had an usually large sequential increase in digital marketing; cost of revenue were before you’ve been seeing some margin expansion there. Was that tied somehow to the TubeMogul mobile revenue upside given the way they were recording and their cost of revenues versus their gross revenue recognition? On the other hand you had a pretty material and sequential decrease in digital media COGS. Is that anomalous, or is that something that you think is sustainable? And lastly, you had a pretty significant increase in services cost of revenue, your revenues were down materially from Q4 to Q1, so lots of moving pieces in COGS. But maybe you can address those? Mark Garrett Yes, I mean the still biggest thing probably worth mentioning Jay, is you’re exactly right. If you look at Digital Marketing this quarter that $10 million of gross revenue recognition would flow right into COGS. So you have $10 million of revenue and $10 million of COGS. If you back that $10 million of COGS out of digital marketing, the gross profit would be exactly the same as last quarter. So, there is really no change to Digital Marketing cost of service, it's been pretty consistent. And you are exactly right it's really driven by Tube. On the Digital Media side, I think what you saw this quarter is some of the upside that you see in our revenue relative to our guidance was from a bit more perpetual product, especially on the Acrobat side. And that comes, as you know, a very, very high gross margin. So, that’s why you would have seen Digital Media gross margin better this quarter. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And the services piece? Mark Garrett I can't remember what your question was. It was back to… Jay Vleeschhouwer So, services revenue were down sequentially, but you had a pretty meaningful sequential increase in services COGS? Mark Garrett The revenues down sequentially mainly because in Q4 it's a very difficult time for the teams to deliver services with holidays and year-end. So, typically Q1 revenue is going to be a little bit lighter on the services side, and the cost of services doesn't change that much. So, that's why you see a little bit less on the gross margin side. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Samad Samana So, we saw that in early February, the Company pushed-out price increases in some international, or outside of the U.S., in some countries where FX is a particular headwind. I'm curious if you learned any lessons from those price increases, and whether it shows you what the appetite for customers is. Is this to accept those, and how it impacts your thought on raising prices in the U.S.? Mark Garrett We did push-out some price increases around the world in various markets, because of FX to stay FX neutral, if you will. And the good news there is we really did not see an impact to ARR. So, that does give us confidence that down the road we're able to tweak pricing a bit. We're not taking advantage of that yet other than FX, but that was a very good sign. Samad Samana Maybe just a quick follow up. Could you give us what the Marketing Cloud revenue growth would have grown year-over-year, excluding the extra week, and the revenue contribution from TubeMogul, just for an apples-to-apples compare? Thanks. Mark Garrett With the week, I'm going to have to get back to you. The TubeMogul gross, you just take out $10 million and instead of $26 million it would have been $24 million. But I don't have the week broken out between the different businesses. It was about $75 million, we said a year ago, but we didn't split it between businesses. I don't think it's very material for Digital Marketing, to be honest with you. It's more material on the media side, that extra week; because you think about it as recognizing revenue from subscribers, it doesn't change that much from a enterprise perspective. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood Shantanu, you mentioned the Adobe Stock has $60 million assets now, and I don't really know how this compares to other offerings. But I know you guys announced partnership with [technical difficulty] a few months ago. And I guess I am just curious how impactful it is when you onboard new content into the service. So, specifically, do you think these partnerships move the needle and increase the attach rate, or getting people to subscribe to the monthly version? And would you say growth is tied to bringing more content onboard, or are you really at that full scale? Shantanu Narayen The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products. I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop. So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product. So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest. The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory. So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market. And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide. And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that’s out there. Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right. So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it. Now, I think in all three of those, we’re continuing to make great progress. And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant. It’s an area we’ll continue to invest in. So, we feel good about it Derrick. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Davis Just real quick question. So it seems to me and you’ve touched on this. So you’re becoming a lot more critical to your customers, and typically that means larger deals. But larger deals have a different selling motion and cadence, and staff dynamics. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- what you believe you need to do to evolve and position yourself to move to larger deals? I mean you obviously keep up with the small stuff too. But that would be helpful. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. The good news is we’re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products. I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas. Where we think we have a world class organization that does that. Because it’s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we’re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects. So I actually feel good about all of those. In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that’s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that. So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we’ve invested in over the last few years. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brent Bracelin Mark, I wanted to go back to the operating margin, non-GAAP operating margins of 36% this quarter. Should be above where we had thought they’d be. If you go back to last two years, Q1 was the low-point. And then you saw basically improvement throughout the year. Is there something different about this year, or different that we should think about, relative to additional expenses or hiring plans that might be a different sequence? And then as a follow-up to that, if I go back and look at where op margins could go, I think the peak was back in 2008 at 40%. How you’re thinking about the op margin trajectory longer term? Mark Garrett There is no difference on the cost side than what you’ve seen in prior years. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, on the revenue side in Q1, we did have a little bit of the upside coming from some increased perpetual revenue on Acrobat side of the business, on the toolbar distribution deal. And that revenue upside can typically drop-down to the bottom-line pretty readily. So, that’s where you saw a bit more margin than we had guided in the first quarter. Expense wise is no real change to our trajectory, and there hasn’t been for quite some time. In terms of long-term margins, the best I can do for you right now is few things; one is we’re very focused on margin; you see that in any given quarter; you see that when we over-achieve on revenue like we did Q1. And we gave a three year model a little while back that shows what margins could look like through, at least '18. And if you looked at that model and looked at it back when we gave it to you, you would see margins up above 35%. Beyond that, we will see. Mike Saviage Operator, we’ll take two more questions please. Operator Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Pat Walravens Shantanu, probably for you, what key points would you make to investors at this point about your activation strategy going forward, and what you’re looking for? Shantanu Narayen We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies. And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we’re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense. And so we have done some when they make sense. But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we’ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how the upsell stock in the Marketing Cloud customers is going relative to the Creative Cloud. As that would seem to be somewhat of untapped opportunities that we don’t talk perhaps as much about? Just kind of curious how should we think about that as another step forward in terms of stock? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about. If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs. And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions. And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we’re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services. And the service that is top of mind for as Stock. So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on. And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business. But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we’re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we’ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves. And I think we’ll continue to be unique in that, we’re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings. We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever. We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision. But thank you for joining us today.

In addition to like your commentary around stock suggested that you were seeing more of an uptick there, and you have things like Sensei and so forth that are incremental to the product that you're delivering in the market. Can you help us understand how much more of a driver ARPU is versus what it’s been over the last several years in this transition? Shantanu Narayen Walter, maybe I'll give you some color which we didn't touch on as another demand driver, which is in the enterprise. As you know, we are coming up on the anniversary of lot of the three year ETLAs. And the first time when we did the three year ETLAs Creative Cloud was relatively new. And so, what we were doing was in-effect providing them with subscription model that mirrored their, what I would call custom way of buying CS in the past. As those are all rolling off the first three year milestone, we are clearly selling them both on the CC complete solution as well as on services. So the number of people who are contracting for services right now, people have to get an exception to not contract for services. And so that clearly represents an increase in ARPU as well. To your point, stock had a good quarter. We continued to see growth, both in terms of the demand, as well as in terms of the inventory. Sign had a good quarter, all of them are adding. And I think what's on your minds as well as investors is, hey, is there leverage and room for price increase as we still think we're in new customer acquisition growth, we're helping people deliver value. And so, that's really what's still driving a lot of the upside in ARR with the potential to look at optimizing further out as well. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Heather Bellini Shantanu, I was wondering if you could share with us how you've seen the success of Creative Cloud impact the adoption of the marketing suites. And I know that's been one of your goals that one could help drive the other. But have you seen any change in the ability for you being the industry standard for Creative, start to impact the Marketing Cloud side of the business? And has the messaging with customer and the receptivity started to -- have you seen any noticeable difference over the last 12 months? Shantanu Narayen It's a really good question Heather, and there's no question actually in our mind that where Creative Cloud was first the door opener for us to have conversations with the enterprise. There is an increased expectation from customers that the content lifecycle that we talk about, namely, the ability for them to accelerate how they deliver campaigns or how they personalize the experience that they wish to deliver across all of these different channels, is predicated on making sure that that content from, content all the way from creation through asset management and all the way out to delivery, is more seamless than it’s ever been. So, I would say three years ago, two years ago, we were talking about that as one of the benefits. I would say today every conversation with the enterprises they see that as a differentiator for us. And the expectation is that’s how they will accelerate both the campaigns and how they will ensure personalize delivery. So, we’re seeing that whether it's in financial services, whether we are seeing retail, travel hospitality, automotive, it’s a key part of our differentiator and one that we will continue to innovate in. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ross MacMillan with RBC Markets. Your line is now open. Ross MacMillan Mark, I didn’t see any commentary on fiscal ’17 guidance. I’m just curious, I guess specifically, about how you are thinking on the 1 billion ARR target, given the strength in Q1 and your guide for Q2, which is certainly above our number. Mark Garrett Clearly, from our perspective, the business is performing exceptionally well. We had a great Q1 across all the key metrics. And to your point, we provided we think are strong Q2 targets. If you remember back, we’ve guided FY ’17 the first time at Analyst Day back in November of last year. We updated it again in December with Q4 earnings. We updated it once more in January for TubeMogul. And we just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance so frequently. So, we’re very happy with the first quarter. We’re very pleased with what we were able to do from a guidance perspective on Q2. Clearly, we’ve got momentum. We just don’t want to get in the habit of updating annual guidance that frequently. Ross MacMillan And then one just quick one, just looking at Q2 guide it implies, at least I think in our model that operating margins maybe are down a little bit sequentially. And I know we have a little bit of an extra three weeks, I think from Tube. But are there any other factors for us to think about in terms of OpEx this quarter, Summit or anything else that’s unusual? Thanks. Mark Garrett Our salary increases kick-in for the Company and that has an effect on Q2 from a cost perspective. You’ll see that every year. We continue to hire and invest in the Company. Again, we feel great about our performance in Q1 and our ability to drive leverage in the model going forward. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Keith Weiss On the Marketing Cloud side, you talked about and there’s Gartner Magic Quadrant that came out during the quarter, and I think Forrester Wave. Are you seeing any change in the competitive environment? Are any of the surround guys or any of the big guys like the Microsoft or the Oracle of the world getting more competitive in that Marketing Cloud field for you guys? And then on as a follow up, any initial gains or any initial benefits you guys are seeing from Microsoft relationship in FY17? Shantanu Narayen Let me take the second first, which is, you’ll get an update as well as Summit. So we’re hoping a lot of will be at Summit. I think you’ll be pleased with how quickly we’ve been able to integrate the products. And from my point of view, the benefit with the Microsoft relationship is really customer driven. Customers are asking for integration with Azure, Power BI, as well as Dynamics. And I think the team has done a great job. But next week we’ll give you a little bit of an update on that. On the first question, as it relates to the competitors, I think we have talked about. This is a $40 billion TAM. Clearly, there are other players that you are alluding to that that are also seeing this as a market opportunity. But our track record and our winning percentage record in the areas that we’re strong continues to be excellent. I think we have a differentiated solution. And I think our vision of where we want to take this and how we want to continue to expand it, I think it still makes us a unique leader. But certainly, there are other players in this market as well Keith. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities. Your line is now open. Jay Vleeschhouwer Question for Mark, as you know, I am particularly interested in your gross margin structure and the various components of that. You had a couple of dichotomous outcomes in Q1 expect to cost revenue the graphic you addressed. You had an usually large sequential increase in digital marketing; cost of revenue were before you’ve been seeing some margin expansion there. Was that tied somehow to the TubeMogul mobile revenue upside given the way they were recording and their cost of revenues versus their gross revenue recognition? On the other hand you had a pretty material and sequential decrease in digital media COGS. Is that anomalous, or is that something that you think is sustainable? And lastly, you had a pretty significant increase in services cost of revenue, your revenues were down materially from Q4 to Q1, so lots of moving pieces in COGS. But maybe you can address those? Mark Garrett Yes, I mean the still biggest thing probably worth mentioning Jay, is you’re exactly right. If you look at Digital Marketing this quarter that $10 million of gross revenue recognition would flow right into COGS. So you have $10 million of revenue and $10 million of COGS. If you back that $10 million of COGS out of digital marketing, the gross profit would be exactly the same as last quarter. So, there is really no change to Digital Marketing cost of service, it's been pretty consistent. And you are exactly right it's really driven by Tube. On the Digital Media side, I think what you saw this quarter is some of the upside that you see in our revenue relative to our guidance was from a bit more perpetual product, especially on the Acrobat side. And that comes, as you know, a very, very high gross margin. So, that’s why you would have seen Digital Media gross margin better this quarter. Jay Vleeschhouwer Okay. And the services piece? Mark Garrett I can't remember what your question was. It was back to… Jay Vleeschhouwer So, services revenue were down sequentially, but you had a pretty meaningful sequential increase in services COGS? Mark Garrett The revenues down sequentially mainly because in Q4 it's a very difficult time for the teams to deliver services with holidays and year-end. So, typically Q1 revenue is going to be a little bit lighter on the services side, and the cost of services doesn't change that much. So, that's why you see a little bit less on the gross margin side. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Stephens Inc. Your line is now open. Samad Samana So, we saw that in early February, the Company pushed-out price increases in some international, or outside of the U.S., in some countries where FX is a particular headwind. I'm curious if you learned any lessons from those price increases, and whether it shows you what the appetite for customers is. Is this to accept those, and how it impacts your thought on raising prices in the U.S.? Mark Garrett We did push-out some price increases around the world in various markets, because of FX to stay FX neutral, if you will. And the good news there is we really did not see an impact to ARR. So, that does give us confidence that down the road we're able to tweak pricing a bit. We're not taking advantage of that yet other than FX, but that was a very good sign. Samad Samana Maybe just a quick follow up. Could you give us what the Marketing Cloud revenue growth would have grown year-over-year, excluding the extra week, and the revenue contribution from TubeMogul, just for an apples-to-apples compare? Thanks. Mark Garrett With the week, I'm going to have to get back to you. The TubeMogul gross, you just take out $10 million and instead of $26 million it would have been $24 million. But I don't have the week broken out between the different businesses. It was about $75 million, we said a year ago, but we didn't split it between businesses. I don't think it's very material for Digital Marketing, to be honest with you. It's more material on the media side, that extra week; because you think about it as recognizing revenue from subscribers, it doesn't change that much from a enterprise perspective. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Derrick Wood with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Derrick Wood Shantanu, you mentioned the Adobe Stock has $60 million assets now, and I don't really know how this compares to other offerings. But I know you guys announced partnership with [technical difficulty] a few months ago. And I guess I am just curious how impactful it is when you onboard new content into the service. So, specifically, do you think these partnerships move the needle and increase the attach rate, or getting people to subscribe to the monthly version? And would you say growth is tied to bringing more content onboard, or are you really at that full scale? Shantanu Narayen The way I would answer that is strategically as we look at that business, there're three things that we think we continue have to execute on to ensure that we capitalize on the opportunity that we've talked about; the first is integration within the products. I think you've seen us make some good integration with products like PhotoShop. So the ability for people to contribute and to acquire assets is built into the product. So, that's one area that we're continuing to make sure we invest. The second one that tends to be a way in which you compete effectively is the inventory. So, I think having the inventory and having the inventory across different kinds of assets, including premium and including partnerships with some of the people that you're talking about, that also helps us ensure that we're competitively, either ahead of the market or at least in line with the market. And the third one that we think about when we think about stock is how good is our technology to find the right asset, based on the intelligence that we can provide. And that's where I think you know we will demonstrate superior advantage to anything else that’s out there. Because our ability to understand these assets and, irrespective of what keyword is being used to search for a particular asset return the right. So in other words search relevance and search is going to be a key part of it. Now, I think in all three of those, we’re continuing to make great progress. And I think at MAX, we showed you a lot of really cool ways in which we will make that more relevant. It’s an area we’ll continue to invest in. So, we feel good about it Derrick. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. Richard Davis Just real quick question. So it seems to me and you’ve touched on this. So you’re becoming a lot more critical to your customers, and typically that means larger deals. But larger deals have a different selling motion and cadence, and staff dynamics. Could you just talk a little bit about how -- what you believe you need to do to evolve and position yourself to move to larger deals? I mean you obviously keep up with the small stuff too. But that would be helpful. Thanks. Shantanu Narayen You’re absolutely right. The good news is we’re absolutely mission-critical to our customers, so the level engagement that we have with these enterprises is at multiple levels, all the way from the C-Suite to all the practitioners who are using our products. I would say actually on the field side and on the partner side, we have evolved that over many areas. Where we think we have a world class organization that does that. Because it’s not just what you do internally, it's ensuring that the thousand partners that I talked about who are also partners to the companies that we’re working with are evangelizing and are promoting our products, and are educated on our projects. So I actually feel good about all of those. In some cases, you have those deals, the larger the size the time taken can increase, but that’s why we want to build a healthy pipeline and continue to execute against that. So, I feel very good about it, and that is without a doubt one of the areas where we’ve invested in over the last few years. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brent Bracelin Mark, I wanted to go back to the operating margin, non-GAAP operating margins of 36% this quarter. Should be above where we had thought they’d be. If you go back to last two years, Q1 was the low-point. And then you saw basically improvement throughout the year. Is there something different about this year, or different that we should think about, relative to additional expenses or hiring plans that might be a different sequence? And then as a follow-up to that, if I go back and look at where op margins could go, I think the peak was back in 2008 at 40%. How you’re thinking about the op margin trajectory longer term? Mark Garrett There is no difference on the cost side than what you’ve seen in prior years. As I just mentioned a few minutes ago, on the revenue side in Q1, we did have a little bit of the upside coming from some increased perpetual revenue on Acrobat side of the business, on the toolbar distribution deal. And that revenue upside can typically drop-down to the bottom-line pretty readily. So, that’s where you saw a bit more margin than we had guided in the first quarter. Expense wise is no real change to our trajectory, and there hasn’t been for quite some time. In terms of long-term margins, the best I can do for you right now is few things; one is we’re very focused on margin; you see that in any given quarter; you see that when we over-achieve on revenue like we did Q1. And we gave a three year model a little while back that shows what margins could look like through, at least '18. And if you looked at that model and looked at it back when we gave it to you, you would see margins up above 35%. Beyond that, we will see. Mike Saviage Operator, we’ll take two more questions please. Operator Certainly. Your next question comes from the line of Pat Walravens with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. Pat Walravens Shantanu, probably for you, what key points would you make to investors at this point about your activation strategy going forward, and what you’re looking for? Shantanu Narayen We actually feel really good about all of the technology that we have, and we were always on the lookout for small innovative companies. And I think both Mark and I have always talked about; we look for is it bringing our strategic advantage; what is the culture of the companies that we’re looking at, because we are very, very thoughtful about making sure that we continue to expand on the vision of what people want; and the third is financially whether it make sense. And so we have done some when they make sense. But we feel really good about the core value that we have, and we’ll continue to be on the lookout for things that meet our criteria in all of those; namely, continuing to expand strategically what we can do; ensuring that the culture fit is right, and financially making sense. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. Kirk Materne Shantanu, I was wondering if you could talk a bit about how the upsell stock in the Marketing Cloud customers is going relative to the Creative Cloud. As that would seem to be somewhat of untapped opportunities that we don’t talk perhaps as much about? Just kind of curious how should we think about that as another step forward in terms of stock? Thanks. Shantanu Narayen I think, Kirk, from my point of view as we are going more and more to these large enterprises with solutions across the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud and the Marketing Cloud, we have a quarter back model, and the named account model with this quarter back is that they are clearly bringing to bear opportunities like the ones that you are talking about. If you are in there primarily with Marketing Cloud ensuring that we sell more solutions, sale Stock, sale Sign and continue to drive the CC DLAs. And so, I think the model that we have in the field is really one of how do we comprehensively to these larger accounts ensure that they are getting the benefit of the breadth of our solutions. And to your point, in CC when we think about the CC enterprise opportunity and the conversation that we are having with those customers, we’re very much moving them from custom to complete and we are moving them from complete to complete plus services. And the service that is top of mind for as Stock. So, a good question and it's clearly one of the areas that we are focused on. And since that was the last question, I think in summary, we were really pleased with the strong start to Q1. It was an outstanding quarter, and I think the Q2 targets that we gave reflect the continued momentum in the business. But in addition to the great quarterly performance, we’re really excited about the long-term opportunities that we’ve outlined, namely the ability to empower people to create the things they want to create and to enable businesses to transform themselves. And I think we’ll continue to be unique in that, we’re one of the only companies that delivering great top line growth and bottom line earnings. We're looking forward to next week's Adobe Summit, it's our largest ever. We really hope you'll join us to hear about our vision for the future, and demonstrate both product and partner progress against that vision. But thank you for joining us today.

The NovaSeq launch surpassed our expectations with more than 135 orders in Q1. Revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $598 million with consumables and services growth more than offsetting the expected decline in sequencing instruments related to the NovaSeq introduction. We were very pleased with both the level of customer interest in the new platform, as well as the positive feedback we received on NovaSeq's attributes. NovaSeq was designed to be the most powerful sequencer ever made. Its price points and throughput enabled customers to increase experimental scale and complexity from panels to exomes and from exomes to genomes, as well as increase sequencing depth. Like the GA, HiSeq and HiSeq X, we are confident that NovaSeq will also demonstrate the elasticity of the genomics market and redefine its trajectory. We were pleasantly surprised by the level of NovaSeq interest from our HiSeq X installed base – as more than a third of HiSeq X customers place NovaSeq orders; many of which were multi-unit deals. We also saw the start of the HiSeq replacement cycle, as the majority of our customers that ordered NovaSeqs were legacy HiSeq customers looking to refresh their fleets and run at the more economic price per gigabase. With an active HiSeq user base of approximately 800 customers, the replacement of older generation instruments by NovaSeq is just beginning. Since launch, we have heard from customers a desire to address each lane of the flow cell independently to more easily allow them to load different library pools, applications and samples. Yesterday, we unveiled a new development program that will bring to market an accessory device and associated consumables to provide this functionality. Compatible with all NovaSeq flow cells, this updated workflow will allow customers to load different project, libraries, and applications in each lane, increasing their multiplexing capabilities and reducing the DNA input needed for each run. We expect to begin shipping the consumables and device for this new workflow in the fourth quarter, shortly after the launch of the S4 flow cell. The response we have seen since NovaSeq launch reinforces our view that as far out as we can see, there is an insatiable demand for high throughput sequencing. We are actively scaling our manufacturing capabilities to meet anticipated demand. During the quarter, we manufactured and installed more than 25 instruments, slightly exceeding the high end of our expected capacity. Importantly, machines installed during the quarter are already producing high quality data in customers' hands. As expected, we will remain capacity constrained in Q2 and are tracking to exit Q3 with NovaSeq manufacturing scaled to meet quarterly demand. Focusing now on the rest of our high throughput portfolio, we were pleasantly surprised at the level of demand for HiSeq and HiSeq X in the first quarter. As we previously shared, we are expected to ship approximately 10 instruments in Q1, which we surpassed. A select clinical customer required additional HiSeq capacity ahead of the broad availability of NovaSeq. Additionally, a few HiSeq X customers added capacity for ongoing projects. And customers in China took shipment of previously ordered instruments at a level that exceeded our expectations, as the HiSeq X remains a powerful competitive product in the regional market. Going forward, our outlook for this family of instruments has not changed and remains muted as we expect a vast majority of customers will wait to access the NovaSeq platform. Our benchtop portfolio was stable in the first quarter as the trends we shared on previous calls remained steady. NextSeq demand continued to be generated by commercial customers including our partners in China – Berry and Annoroad. Annoroad received Chinese FDA approval for their NIPT assay on the NextSeq AR550 during the quarter, further strengthening the NextSeq outlook in the region. New-to-sequencing customers continued to bolster MiniSeq and MiSeq placements as they accounted for approximately 60% of quarterly shipments. Additionally, we are adding to our benchtop specialist team to generate incremental demand for our low-end portfolio and library prep solutions, as well as investing further in lead generation and inside sales. In Q1, microarray revenue including services grew 17% year-over-year to just over $100 million, driven primarily by consumer demand, which increased over 40% versus the prior year. Total oncology testing demand also remained robust, as shipments to this market segment grew 20% versus the prior year. This strong result was driven by continued growth in commercial molecular diagnostic customers, as well as the translational liquid biopsy segment. Moving now to reproductive and genetic health. We will continue to see positive NIPT reimbursement trends in the United States. CAPS, the Coalition for Access to Prenatal Screening contacted the vast majority of Medicaid offices in Q1 to update their respective fee schedules to be in line with the reimbursement level set by the 27 Clinical Lab Fee Schedule. In response, more than 20% of states contacted are reviewing their reimbursement practices and four states are in the process of increasing their fee schedules. Additionally, outside the U.S., we are also making progress in driving NIPT adoption with the recent launch of our VeriSeq NIPT Solution, which includes a CE-IVD marked library prep and analysis software, clinical labs will now have access to highly accurate, fast and reliable software for analysis of NIPT in-house. Reimbursement in the region is progressing. In addition to the Netherlands, Denmark began covering the test during Q1 and a coverage decision is expected shortly in France. Over the last few years, we have also been focused on ensuring pediatric patients with suspected genetic conditions of access to sequencing, which has been shown to dramatically increase the diagnostic yield in these cases. There are 15 million children in the United States living with a rare and undiagnosed disease that historically have not had access to sequencing. This market continues to progress well as recent updates made to certain payer policies now reimburse whole exome sequencing for pediatric patients with suspected genetic conditions. Today, coverage stands at 50 million lives, a vast improvement made in just a few months. In closing, I'm pleased with our first quarter results, which has set the stage for a strong 2017. I will now turn the call over to Sam for a detailed overview of our first quarter results. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Thanks, Francis. As Francis mentioned, Q1 revenue grew 5% year-over-year to $598 million, slightly exceeding our quarterly guidance. Geographically, revenue in the Americas grew 4%, while we saw a decline of 2% in Europe. Asia Pacific grew revenue 15% versus the prior year. Continued weakness in Japan's genomics funding was more than offset by China shipments, which grew more than 35% due to clinical and high throughput instrument demand. Given the transition in our high throughput portfolio, instrument revenue declined 15% year-over-year to $100 million, in line with our expectations. First quarter consumable revenue represented 65% of total revenue or $387 million, an increase of 7% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Sequencing consumable revenue also grew 7% year-over-year to approximately $320 million as a result of growth in our installed base. Utilization trends across the benchtop portfolio were steady, as pull-through came in within each instruments' respective guidance range. HiSeq and HiSeq X consumable revenue was slightly below our forecast, as customers ramped down their reagent orders at a rate that slightly exceeded our expectations; instead, using inventory on hand given the upcoming integration of NovaSeq into their operations. We believe our customers continue to sequence in Q1 at typical rates, despite the lower reagent revenue, which is an indicator of the expected reagent rebalancing required with the launch of NovaSeq. This transition impact is expected to continue in Q2 before improving in the second half. We removed close to 20 HiSeq instruments from our installed base during the quarter, a figure which is expected to increase as customers begin to ramp up production on NovaSeq. Services and other revenue grew approximately 20% versus Q1 2016 to $107 million. This improvement was driven by strength in genotyping services due to consumer demand and sequencing instrument maintenance contracts. Turning now to gross margin and operating expenses. I will highlight our non-GAAP results. As previously noted, we will report gross margin, R&D, SG&A and operating margin inclusive of stock-based compensation going forward. This is consistent with the treatment of the expense in our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share figures. I encourage you to review the GAAP reconciliation of non-GAAP measures, which can be found in today's earnings release and presentation. Please note that all subsequent references to net income and earnings per share refers to the results attributable to Illumina stockholders. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 66.4%, a decrease of 310 basis points sequentially. Lower instrument margin given high throughput promotions and ramping NovaSeq manufacturing, as well as mix within sequencing consumables and arrays were the primary drivers of the sequential decline. Year-over-year gross margin decreased 490 basis points impacted again by lower sequencing instrument margin and mix within consumables and arrays. Non-GAAP research and development expenses in Q1 were $140 million or 23.3% of revenue, an increase of $10 million over Q4. And non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the quarter equaled $152 million or 25.6% of revenue, an increase of $7 million sequentially. The sequential increase in operating expense was primarily driven by higher stock compensation expense, which grew $12 million, given a full quarter of expense associated with our annual equity grant, as well as increased benefit in variable compensation expense. Looking to Q2, we expect operating expenses to increase sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margins were 17.5% compared to 25.1% in the fourth quarter, and operating margin was lower compared to the 23.9% reported in the first quarter of last year due to increased investments in head count, GRAIL, and Helix. Excluding GRAIL and Helix, operating margin was 21.1% compared to 29.6% in the fourth quarter. Although the sequential decline was expected, it was larger than anticipated due to the previously mentioned drivers impacting gross margin. We reported first quarter GAAP net income of $373 million including the book gain on our partial sale of GRAIL shares, and EPS of $2.52 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $94 million or $0.64 of EPS, with GRAIL and Helix dilution of $0.03 and $0.04, respectively. Cash flow from operations equaled $168 million reduced by 100% of the GRAIL and Helix cash burn of $30 million this quarter. Q1 DSO totaled 56 days equal to last quarter. Capital expenditures in Q1 were $83 million, and we reported an additional $27 million increase in property and equipment recorded under build-to-suit lease accounting, where such expenses were paid for by the landlord. Consequently, Q1 free cash flow was $85 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, including $278 million of proceeds from GRAIL Series B raise, of which $92 million will be used to pay the associated tax liability. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares under our previously announced buyback program at an average price of $162, completing the authorization. Turning now to guidance. We expect Q2 revenue to grow approximately 7% versus the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $0.56 to $0.61 resulting in non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.65 to $0.70. For 2017, we continue to project approximately 10% to 12% total company revenue growth, including less than a 1% revenue contribution from each of GRAIL and Helix. For the full year GAAP earnings per diluted share, we are expecting $5.26 to $5.36, which now includes the one-time impact of the GRAIL Series B raise in Q1 and non-GAAP EPS is still expected to be $3.60 to $3.70. Our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes no meaningful impact to tax expense from the new stock-based compensation pronouncement. Thank you for your time. We'll now move to the Q&A session. To allow full participation, please ask one question and rejoin the queue if you have additional questions. Operator, we'll now open the lines. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, thanks. First question on NovaSeq. Congrats on the orders. I guess as we think about what the funnel looks like – I know you said the majority were legacy HiSeq customers – can you talk a little bit about any mix dynamics there in terms of low throughput versus high throughput labs, 2500 versus older customers? And anything, I guess, we should be thinking about in terms of the pacing of GRAIL orders throughout the course of the year? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure. Hey, Tycho. So as we look at where the orders came in in Q1, I'd say the majority were HiSeq legacy customers as we pointed out. About 40% came from customers who are just HiSeq X customers, so the large genome centers, for example, and then about 10% were new to sequencing. And so, we were really encouraged to see sort of the broad mix of customers, validating the thesis that there is an upgrade cycle in progress here that's starting from HiSeq, but that the NovaSeq platform is also attractive to HiSeq X customers, especially as four comes out later in the year. We're also starting to have conversations with people who are entering the high throughput space with the promise of what NovaSeq can do around certain projects. So, early indications but it was good to see customers from a number of segments sign up to NovaSeq. In terms of GRAIL... Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Go ahead. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. In terms of GRAIL, we talked about the fact that over the course of the year, we expect less than 1% of our company revenue to come from GRAIL, and we still expect that. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then can you help us on the 2Q guide? You're coming in $0.20 lower than the Street. Is that all higher OpEx? And can you maybe talk about what those incremental investments largely are? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. Hi, Tycho. This is Sam. So, I think some of the dynamics that we saw in Q1, specifically with regards to gross margin, we expect to see again in Q2. As we ramp up the production of NovaSeq, as we ramp up the manufacturing, as we also see some of the transition in consumables with the customers whether it's validating their workflows, depleting inventories, we expect to see similar gross margin profile in Q2 – actually slightly lower in Q2. So I think that's a key driver. There is some operating expense growth as well that drives the EPS as well. So, I think those are the key drivers in terms of the sequential Q1 to Q2 EPS. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And not nearly as meaningful, but just Helix will continue to ramp sequentially as well. Just more of a small impact, though. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. If I could squeeze one more in because it's an important question we're getting a lot. It's just on the cross-contamination, barcoding issues, Francis. Can you maybe just comment on that and I'll hop off? Thanks. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure, Tycho. So, we've been working with a couple of customers who've experienced elevated levels of this index swapping on the HiSeq 4000. We don't expect it to have an impact on the NovaSeq demand trajectory going forward. As background, we have seen low levels of index swapping in the 0.1% to 2% range. And that's been sort of a part of the noise, if you like, in (19:44) now ever since the GA at a very low level. It has really no meaningful impact on sequencing results for the vast majority of applications, and there are a number of best practices, including using washers to remove free adapters from libraries, using unique dual indexes that further reduce even this low level of index swapping. We have been engaged with a couple of customers in the last quarter that have seen elevated levels of index swapping on the HiSeq 4000. We've been working with them to understand the specifics of their situation and share best practices that will help mitigate the issues that they're seeing. As we think about NovaSeq, I said we don't expect to see an issue, and the offering we have coming out later this year that will help customers address individual lanes will help mitigate this issue even further because it will lower the level of multiplexing that you need to do on NovaSeq. Operator And another question... Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. Sorry. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Recognizing it's still early, is NovaSeq driving any increased demand from biopharmaceutical customers? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hey, Doug. At this stage, it's too early to call sort of an industry trend like that, so it's certainly driven a lot of conversations, but again, too early probably to call out a specific trend like that. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. (21:24) Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Regarding the develop – oh, go ahead. I'm sorry, Rebecca. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. No problem. I was just going to say outside of Regeneron that we highlighted is one of the initial customers at JPMorgan. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you for that. Regarding the development of the workflow to allow for multichannel loading of NovaSeq flow cells, is this largely to accommodate some of the smaller core labs that were concerned about number of samples required to make the economics work on the NovaSeq? And I guess on your website, you indicated you decided to make this new workflow available based on customer feedback, factor again this feedback, how much demand do you think this change opens up in terms of market opportunity? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure. So, this new offering does help address a number of things, including some of things you talked about. What it does is it allows customers to run experiments with samples that have lower DNA inputs. It allows them to run different applications across the different flow cells. So, it gives you a number of things that customers have wanted that they've given us feedback on since we launched the NovaSeq. In general, these are sort of incremental improvements to the NovaSeq platform. And so, we shouldn't expect a dramatic change in the demand trajectory associated with NovaSeq because of these improvements. They are good but they're not going to change fundamentally the demand trajectory. And also, this comes out in Q4. And so, it really shouldn't have much impact on 2017 at all. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks for that. One last quick one and then I'll get back in the queue. Given the stage where you are in the product rollout and the manufacturing ramp, I know in your prepared remarks you talked again about the expected manufacturing constraints progressing through the supply chain, is it fair to assume that was a full quarter of production that you could at least double the number of NovaSeq placements in the second quarter? Thank you. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. So, I'll start by saying I touched on this in the prepared remarks, but we're very happy with where we are at the end of Q1. Obviously, an instrument like NovaSeq is a brand-new architecture from the ground up. And so it was a very big task to scale up the manufacturing process on something like a NovaSeq. And so, as we close out the quarter, we shipped just over 25 instruments and not only are we happy with the number, but we are also very happy with the quality of the instruments and the quality of the data that our customers are seeing. We expect to continue to ramp, as we said, over Q2 and Q3. And over Q3 we expect to be at the stage where we are – we expect to exit Q3 at the stage where we're meeting the incoming order demand. I think that we haven't given specific guidance in terms of the manufacturing for Q2, but something along the lines of what you talked about seems reasonable. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks again. Operator The next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker Hey, guys. It's Luke (24:44) in for Ross today. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hey, Luke (24:47). Unknown Speaker I guess, as you look at the evolution of the sequencing market and as it's gone all the way back to the GA, and now we're pushing on the edge of clinical sequencing, how has the feedback from customers kind of shaped your medium-term opportunity? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. As you point out, we've seen these step changes in the market before as we put out the GA and the HiSeq and the HiSeq X. And so we come in to this with that experience. And so far I would say that NovaSeq has played well to our expectations, that we expected NovaSeq to drive an upgrade cycle in our high throughput customer base starting that with the HiSeq customers and then to the HiSeq X customers and that starting to play out as we talked about in the quarter, we do think now that this will drive – with the data we have, this will drive that upgrade cycle in our legacy customers. We've also talked about the fact that we expect NovaSeq with its power and its price points to drive the elasticity of the market. And it is early, but there are indications we're getting from our customers in terms of new projects that have been announced like the Regeneron-Glaxo project for the Biobank in the UK. Those kinds of projects as well as ultra-deep sequencing project in the oncology market as well as liquid biopsy sequencing. So, three months, it's early data. But the early data is very consistent with the hypothesis we had when we embarked on the development cycle for NovaSeq. Unknown Speaker Great. Thanks. Operator And the next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch So, you mentioned 20 HiSeqs came out of the mix during the quarter in your genetics accelerate (26:48). Do have any sort of estimates for where the HiSeq number will end up be in VRM (26:54)? I'm trying to get to the swap ratio and sort of what's the indication from customers that have bought so far or so far of what – how many HiSeqs are going to pull out for the Novas? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Derik, we don't provide that number. And so, I guess, mostly what we can do to help you is sort of give you the qualitative results that we've talked about that we are seeing an earlier then maybe slightly earlier than expected conversation with the HiSeq X customers in terms of looking at NovaSeq. We certainly expect as S4 comes out, that we will see HiSeq X customers moving or re-platforming to NovaSeq. At this point, I don't have any data to give you – I can share with you around ratios. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And, Derik, part of the reason for that is, effectively, some customers are just testing out NovaSeq, so they aren't necessarily thinking about the ratio for the entirety of their fleet. Other customers are further down that path. And so the variance between customers is quite wide. Additionally, for us to take something out of the installed base, it needs to really not be used, right? And so, that's not something that really we can forecast at this point in time, because many customers do keep these boxes installed until they're not being used for quarters upon quarters. And so, that's more of a retroactive look and not necessarily something that we can forecast. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Right. And then, a quick follow-up on that. You said the consumable pull-down was a little bit more than you thought in terms of slower and – attributing that to more inventory reduction rather than delays in terms of the sequencing market, I agree with you, but I was just wondering if you did any – found any evidence at all that certainly the funding uncertainty in the market is having any issues? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. I've not heard from anywhere that the funding uncertainty is what's driving the consumable slowdown. What we do know is that we initiated conversations with our high throughput customers and that has caused our customers to do a number of things. One, they are pausing, so they can talk to us about NovaSeq. They are drawing down existing inventory with the understanding that they are likely just sort of re-platforming the future. They're also not doing any large future buys for the same reason. And then initially, there will be the smaller purchases as they validate the workflows associated with the NovaSeq. And so, those are expected steps. And so, that's what's driving the slowdown that we saw in the consumables. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc. Having said that, I'll just point out that Q1 is normally a strong order quarter for consumables, sequencing consumables in general. And we did see some backlog build there as well from our customers. So, those who aren't slowing down at least are still placing orders and expecting those to be shipped throughout the year. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator And the next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Hi guys. Thank you. Francis, can you just talk about the back half of the year? Any assumptions around the HiSeq X system pull-through once the S4 configuration is out there and presumably folks start doing holds more (30:14) on the Nova? Are you still thinking you can exit the year with the HiSeq X still in the $625,000 to $725,000 range? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. So, we are not expecting those pull-through ranges to sort of carry forward as we go through this transition period. And so, I talked a little bit about the dynamics that are playing out and the high throughput market in terms of people looking to re-platform to NovaSeq and that is affecting the kinds of orders that they will be placing and the work that they'll be doing as they transition on to the NovaSeq platform. We are also expecting very little in terms of new X placements, obviously, as we look at Q2 going forward. And so, that will have some impact in the back half of the year overall as well. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And, Dan, we said on the Q4 call that we had suspended that range. And so, this isn't necessarily a change in messaging. It's effectively just the continuation of that messaging where we don't necessarily have a HiSeq or HiSeq X guidance range at this point in time because this transition is dynamic. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. And so, what you can expect to see is that this is going to be the transition year. And then, as we go through sort of a four-quarter period on NovaSeq, we'll be in a better position to start to talk to you about what you can expect on NovaSeq. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And maybe just following up on your comments, Francis, on HiSeq versus HiSeq X customers in your order book, can you just sort of further that thought by talking about how many of the 85 or so orders beyond the 49 that you announced in January came from conversion of the HiSeq X backlog? I think there were 35 or 40 in the backlog as of 4Q. Just curious how many of those traded up. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. We haven't done the breakdown on the post-49... (32:03) Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. I guess, 49 to the greater than 135 (32:05). I think the overall number is generally representative. I'd say, so I don't know – I haven't done the breakdown for the post, but I don't expect this incremental insight to come from that breakdown. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator And the next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks. I just had a couple of follow-ups to some of the questions that have been asked. So, I guess first on the replacement cycle more broadly, so you've talked to some of the demand that might have been a bit surprising for the legacy platforms outside of the HiSeq X. So, I'm just curious, I guess, does that demand change your view ultimately on what the magnitude of the replacement cycle could look like for the NovaSeq or the timing? And then, just if you have any updates on your thoughts around supporting or I guess offering the legacy platforms? I think you've made comments about HiSeq 2500, but some of the other HiSeqs? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure. I'll start by saying that we still deeply believe that NovaSeq will drive an upgrade cycle off our HiSeq customer base and over time our HiSeq X customer base. And so, we talked about the fact that we have 800 HiSeq customers. And we have north of 30 HiSeq X customers. We deeply believe that, and everything that's happened in Q1 in my mind sort of reaffirms that thesis for us. What we saw in Q1 was we saw slightly stronger than expected demand, we said, for HiSeq X and for HiSeq, and what was playing out there, where there are customers that are in the midst of running large whole genome projects, and they needed more capacity. And what they didn't want to do was switch platforms in the middle of a project. And so, they added capacity and they added Xs. We also saw some customers in China that continue to buy Xs because in that region it's a very competitive platform. And until we get to the S4, it's going to continue to be a very competitive platform. And then we had some clinical customers that have their validated workflows that are sticking with the platform that they are using. We think these are transition effects. I think they drop off very quickly even in Q2. And so, it doesn't really change our thesis around the upgrade cycle. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. That makes sense... (34:33) Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. ...position on what our portfolio plan around the instruments we're looking to retire, that doesn't change. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And I just had one other follow-up to Tycho's question on margin. So, just thinking about when you have the NovaSeq sort of up and running. Can you give us some, at least, qualitative commentary on the right way to think about the margin profile on the NovaSeq when you – from an instrumentation consumable perspective, particularly given that you're obviously launching higher performance cells and single loading cells going forward? Just on a sort of more sustainable basis. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Sure, Amanda. This is Sam. So, I think the way to look at NovaSeq margin profile from an instrument standpoint, I think it's slightly lower margin than our HiSeq platform, and I think as we go forward in the year and as manufacturing ramps up, the margin profile on the instrument will improve, but it will still be slightly below the HiSeq X instrument and the HiSeq profile. So, there will definitely be an improvement in the instrument margin as we go through the year, but it will still be below the HiSeq platform, higher than the benchtop platform though. From a consumable standpoint, I think the important part is that as we ramp up consumables in the second half of the year, we also expect to see a margin profile on the consumables that's on par with our high throughput consumables. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks very much. Operator And the next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I also wanted to follow up on one of Tycho's questions. You mentioned 10% of NovaSeq customers are new to sequencing. Is that what you thought the uptake would be like compared to previous new product launches and any other data points around new customer interest would be great? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. I mean that was a good number. It wasn't a hugely surprising number. Given the dynamics that we are seeing, we did expect some new customers to be created in the high throughput segment. Some of them are regionally oriented, so we're seeing new customers, for example, emerge in China. Some of them driven by the opportunity created by the Chinese Precision Medicine Initiative. So, the number wasn't really that surprising. And we expect to see some of that going forward. Obviously, most of the new-to-sequencing customers typically show up at the lower end of our portfolio, so 60% of the MiniSeq, MiSeq level of our customers coming in there are new-to-sequencing customers. But at the top end, 10% is not too surprising. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. And then just as a follow-up. I wanted to ask about the service revenue strength in the quarter. It looks like it was coming through the microarray line. Just any color there would be great, or broader trends around service revenue. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure, Jack. Yeah, absolutely, it was coming in from the microarray line, and it's driven by the real strength we're seeing in the consumer market. And so, it's related to the services that we offer to the consumer market, which now for many quarters has been a strong segment for us. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator And the next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Good afternoon everyone. This is Alex Nowak on for Bill today. So, the 135 orders surpassed your expectations but you also reiterated top-line guidance. So I'm just wondering if you could reconcile the two. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. The 135 orders was slightly better than we were expecting for Q1, but it's still very early in the year. We still have – the majority of the work to do for the year is still in front of us. This is still a back-end loaded year for us. And so, while we are happy with the way Q1 played out, we feel it's too early to change anything for the whole year. Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. Thank you. And then the second question for me. What gives you confidence that there's enough sequencing demand that NovaSeq's consumable sales pull-through for instrument will be about the same if not better than HiSeq? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. There are a few things. One is our experience now in this market across the introduction of multiple high throughput platforms has given us a track record now of seeing what happens with our customers that as we give customers high-throughput capacity, they are able to embark on more ambitious sequencing-intensive projects. And so, in previous platforms, customers were able to go from panels to exomes, from exomes to genomes with the HiSeq X. And what we're hearing from customers now is that more customers want to go from exomes to genomes. So, not just the HiSeq X customers, but now our HiSeq customers want to do that. And the HiSeq 4000 is good, but the NovaSeq really enables that. In addition, they're giving us examples of projects in areas like single cell or wanting to do much, much deeper sequencing for tumor normals or liquid biopsies or other applications where they're effectively looking for the uncommon needle in a haystack type of events. And so we're getting feedback from our customers around the projects that they want to embark on, which is consistent with the experience we had in this market before. And now, as we come out of Q1, it's clear that customers are buying a high throughput platform because they intended to use the capabilities that come from a high throughput platform. So, as they purchase, they have plans around which one they want to utilize the platform for and they have expectations that it will be a reasonably utilized platform, too. And so, now we have a few months of data now coming to us with customers reacting to a specific platform. And that's very consistent with our thesis (40:42). Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, guys. Thank you. Francis, I had a question for you on the consumer market. I think the FDA recently took a more dovish stance with regards to consumer testing for things like risk assessment and so just wondering if – just given that that was a relatively new development, if there's anything baked into your guidance this year with regards to an acceleration in those types of markets? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. That was a really good step forward, we think, for the consumer market. We are really happy about the impact it's going to have definitely and immediately on 23andMe. But we think it's a very good sign for the entire consumer market. So, Ancestry, Helix and everybody else, and that obviously is good for us, too. Now, we have known that 23andMe has been working on this for a while. And so, while it was news obviously when it happened, it's not entirely unexpected from our perspective. And so, it's consistent with our view of how the consumer market is likely to play out over the course of this year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up. I think all the questions around NovaSeq were pretty well covered. So, I want to maybe focus on the other parts of the portfolio, on the instrument side, specifically, Firefly. I think you guys gave a little bit of an update in January regarding performance specs and timeline for end of year. Just wondering if that's still on track and any evolved thoughts on what that product line ultimately means for your expansion of the opportunity? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. The team is making very good progress on Firefly even since the update we gave in January. As we talked about in January, the intent is to bring out the sequencing box end of this year, beginning of next year and then bring out the library print box about a year later, and the team is on track to do that. This is one of the fortunate situations where we've announced the product well before bringing it into the market. And one of the reasons to do that was to allow us to engage with prospective customers. And the team has been doing that. And so, it's starting to get a good sense for the customer segments that it will be applicable for and what's particularly exciting is they're identifying customer segments that may be new to sequencing that are attracted to Firefly. And so, good progress, on track with the timelines that we talked about in January. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. Thanks a bunch. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Thank you, Isaac. Operator And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Close enough. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. So, first question is on consumables, in sequencing consumables. Sam, could you put any more granularity around what you saw in the first quarter and the impact of some of these dynamics around Nova and the way customers are thinking about the transition? I mean, given that you have – I would imagine a pretty good handle on who the customers are, do you have any idea of what sequencing consumables growth might have looked like on an apples-to-apples basis in a scenario where we didn't have the Nova transition? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. It's hard to give you kind of the apples-to-apples comparison that you're asking for, but let me give you a little bit of color, at least, in terms of what we saw in Q1 and expectations going forward. I think what we saw is basically almost what we expected which is, as Francis mentioned before, customers essentially validating their workflows, pausing, depleting some of their inventories. And we think that played into the lower sequencing consumable volumes that we saw in the quarter. And we think this is expected, given the rebalancing to a new platform, which is NovaSeq. And as we look forward, specifically to the second half, I think the expectation is that we would see a ramp-up in consumables. Now, as we said, going into Q1, that consumable growth is going to essentially decelerate given some of that time that customers will need to ramp up on their consumable purchases of NovaSeq. But essentially it's playing out as we pretty much expected, maybe slightly lower consumables on the HiSeq, HiSeq X compared to what we had expected. But as we look forward, we think that that's – our expectations are that we will see consumables ramp up with the NovaSeq uptick. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. In the back half of the year. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. In the back half. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And one thing to add to that, Steve, is there is absolutely nothing that we've heard from our customers that would lead us to believe that there's anything going on with regard to sequencing consumables beyond this natural transition. We have seen very, very large customers work down their inventories on hand, which led to the sequential decline in the high throughput component of the portfolio. So I think that is absolutely on par with our expectations. To Sam's point, maybe a little bit quicker than we had expected, but that is aligned with HiSeq X customers exceeding our expectations with NovaSeq. So, it's all one and the same in terms of the drivers. And on an apples-to-apples basis, ex the NovaSeq transition, we would expect nothing beyond the traditional formula of what sequencing consumables would do in any given quarter. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. I appreciate all the color there. And just one follow-up here and that relates to the operating expense where there has been some commentary in the prepared remarks on adding new feet on the street, if you will, new folks throughout the organization. I wonder if you could spend a minute just talking about where these people are headed. Then maybe if you could compare head count growth that you're thinking about for the company in 2017 relative to the last couple of years, just as we think about the modeling, that would be a big help. Thanks again. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. So, one of the areas we are going to be adding feet on the street is around focusing on the low end part of our portfolio, the benchtop instruments. So, we're looking to add an inside sales team, expand the inside sales team that focuses on that part of the portfolio, additional lead generation capability to drive leads into that part of the portfolio. You, as a customer, would have already seen the investments we've made in e-commerce. So, that's come online in the past few months, and we're going to continue to invest there because we think there's a real opportunity to improve the customer experience, as well as improve the velocity at which we do deals, and our cost to serve by moving the – part of the consumables part of our business as well as the low end portfolio through e-commerce. And so, those are some of the areas that you can expect to see us expand our capacity. Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc. I would just add geographically in China as well as a major investment for us this year. Operator And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just one briefly – I just wanted to understand a little bit, I think it's been covered – parts of it had been covered before. But as the installs that are already happened, some of them have gone through the validation. If you could talk about and maybe give color on how labs are designing experiments? I'm sure there are some labs that are transitioning from validation to designing their own experiments on this. Are they simply waiting for S4, or are they in the meantime using the S2 flow cell to try to do some of these experiments? And does that – and taking on some of the production samples on to S2 and does that change your view at all on timing of S4 and maybe potentially moving that up? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. So, I'd say that if you think about the makeup of the people who bought NovaSeq, I said, the majority of them were legacy HiSeq customers. And so, for them the move to S2 is a beneficial move on its own. And so, they're certainly not waiting for S4 and nor do they need to. And so, we expect the people who bought NovaSeq will start to sequence on S2 and very few (49:26) will be waiting for S4 before they start sequencing. Obviously, if you are a HiSeq X customer, you're designing very large experiments. The S4 is a really exciting flow cell for you. And it was actually that feedback we got from customers when we launched the NovaSeq that caused us to pull the S4 in from Q4 to Q3. And so, that's our plan of record, and that's the plan that we're going to stick to, but it was very much driven by the higher-than-expected interest we got in S4 from HiSeq X customers, certainly. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Okay, got that. And then just a one quick follow-up. Could you update us on the manufacturing ramp? I mean, there is – obviously, the HiSeqs are getting essentially reduced in some of the facilities, the San Diego, the Bay Area, the Singapore and Cambridge facility and the Wisconsin facility that you have. So, just trying to understand how are you ramping up NovaSeq and re-tooling some of those facilities to ramp up on both flow cells and the instruments. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. (50:38) NovaSeq is a completely brand-new architecture, and every major component is a brand-new component in NovaSeq. And so, it has been a really big effort on behalf of our operations team to ramp up our manufacturing capability on NovaSeq and transition that product from product development into our operations team. And I am incredibly proud of the terrific work that team has done in getting to where we are and allowing us to be slightly ahead of where we expected to be, as we got out of Q1. The way we think about our facilities broadly is a lot of our new introduction work happening here in the U.S. close to the development centers, and that's consistent with how we're thinking about ramping up NovaSeq. And that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you. Just wanted to clarify. Well, two questions. The first one, clarification on gross margin. Sam, I think you mentioned that the promotions and the high throughput sequencing market were part of the depression on gross margin in the quarter. Can you clarify what you're doing in the promotional space and the high throughput market and why that would continue in Q2? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Well, as we ramp up NovaSeq and for some of the customers that have ordered HiSeq in the past, we've said that we were going to have a promotion where we would match some of the prices. So we have – essentially that's had a negative impact on ASP on some of our high throughput instruments. So, that's primarily the reason... Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. In the first quarter, but that's just not expected to continue into the second quarter, Dan. The second quarter impact is more along the line of the ramping NovaSeq – effectively mix... Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. So... Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. ...in the sequencing instrument line. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Right. So that's the second part, which is as we move forward, it's really a question of NovaSeq ramping up in terms of production. And until the volumes catch up in Q3 and Q4, we're going to continue to see some negative impact on gross margin in Q2 because of that. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Thank you. And then my follow-up question. Can you offer us an update on what percentage of your revenue is China? And you're going to be rolling up again some pretty tough comps in the second half from China, and whether you expect the growth rate to continue at the levels you've been seeing? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. We remain bullish on the Chinese market opportunity. Roughly, you should think about it already around 10% of our business. And the secular drivers of the market there continue to be positive. So, we're seeing growth in the clinical markets associated with both NIPT and oncology, and that played out last year. We expect – that trend is continuing to play out this year. We're also seeing demand driven by the government's Precision Medicine Initiative. So, money has started flowing. Projects are being funded, and that is causing customers to purchase our instruments, that's causing in some cases new customers to be created. And all that is going to continue to play out, certainly over the course of this year, but likely for a few years. In this quarter, Annoroad just got clearance from the CFDA around its assay, and that will continue to give it momentum in the market. And so, it's a market we are excited about. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And just one thing to highlight with regard to our outperformance in the region last year, obviously, we'll have a challenging comp as we go throughout the course of this year and the benefit of HiSeq X instrument sales in particular that we saw last year. So, just to take that into account, I completely echo Francis' statements with that caveat. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. I don't want to neglect the desktop lines – benchtop lines rather. Can you talk about whether your pull-through there was within the guidance ranges for each of those and also comment on the level of placements, were they kind of up, down or flat relative to the back half 2016? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. The pull-through numbers were consistent with the ranges that we provided. And the (55:15) numbers were roughly in line with where we expected. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then the weakness in Europe, can you just talk – maybe give a little color around that. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. The weakness in Europe was primarily driven by the NovaSeq transition and the challenge – they had a good Q1 shipment number last year. I wouldn't call it weakness in Europe. I would call it more they met their forecast and plans. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Bryan. Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi. Good afternoon. So you mentioned the solid 20% growth in oncology in your prepared remarks. Is a large piece of that growth coming from the TST 170, or if you elaborate on what's the underlying driver of that? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. TST 170 is a piece of it, but it's certainly not a big piece of it. I mean, it's a fairly new product to the market. And so you should expect to see that ramp. But in Q1 it was certainly not a big piece of the growth we're seeing. We are continuing to see strength in the translation of market in oncology, driven by the large cancer centers. We talked about the growth we're seeing driven by the adoption of liquid biopsy market of sequencing. So, those are some of the variables that played out much more so than TST 170. Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities All right. And would you expect that piece of the market to adopt the NovaSeq, and therefore, could there be any sort of a hiccup in oncology as those customers transition over to that system? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. I certainly expect over time given that some of the applications we're talking about includes things like very deep sequencing for tumor normal or for liquid biopsies. So, I expect over time, NovaSeq will be attractive to a segment of the market, but we're seeing enough growth from other parts of the market that I'm not sure that you should expect to see a pause in this market at all. I don't think it will just the wholesale adoption of NovaSeq. I mean, there's so many different types of customers that are buying that. I think it will just continue to see growth in that market. Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Thank you very much. Operator And our next question comes from Catherine from Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi. Hi. Thanks for the question. Catherine Schulte here. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Catherine. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Are you accepting S4 orders in advance of that launch? Are those included in the 135-order number? And then will you have initial manufacturing constraints for the S4 when it launches or will it immediately be able to meet demand? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. The way to think about the 135-order is that people are buying the platform. And initially, they will buy S2 because that's the flow cell that's available, and then they will buy – some of them may buy S4 flow cells when it becomes available. But they're not buying it and then waiting for S4. That's not how they are thinking about it. What was the second part of your question? (58:22) Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Will there be initial manufacturing constraints for S4? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. I don't think so. I think the bigger constraint will be just on the platform, and that's the constraint that we're working through. I expect that as we bring S4 out, we should be able to ramp up to meet demand. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. And then for NovaSeq orders, can you just describe the cadence of those throughout the quarter and entering the second quarter? I know you had a lot buzz around the JPMorgan Conference, but just talk about how those progressed over time. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. I think, it is interesting. It's been non-linear. It's probably the best way to describe it in the few days before JPMorgan and in some cases actually in the few hours before JPMorgan, as I had personally reached out to a small set of customers and then a couple of other people reached out to a couple of others. And so we were able to come out of the gate and talk about the commitments we've had from that first set of customers. And so, we were able to come out of the gate and talk about the commitments we had from that first set of customers. For everyone else, including everyone in the Illumina commercial organization, the first time really they heard about NovaSeq was when it was announced on stage at JPMorgan. And so, in some sense that was sort of the starting gun for our entire commercial organization. And we had immediately planned that day a set of training webinars and a marketing campaign ready to go, our road shows that literally took off that week around the globe to start to explain to our field and to our customers what NovaSeq was. And so, we got that initial bolus of customers in the few days and the few hours before JPMorgan. And then we started the sales process. And so, it's a period when we weren't getting any orders because we were still teaching our own team and teaching the rest of the world what NovaSeq was. And so, that started to play out in the weeks after we launched. And so it really started to come to fruition, if you like, in March primarily where those conversations started to play out into orders. I mean, roughly, obviously, there are exceptions, but that's roughly how it played out. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Really helpful. Thank you. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Rebecca Chambers for final remarks. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.

We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, thanks. First question on NovaSeq. Congrats on the orders. I guess as we think about what the funnel looks like – I know you said the majority were legacy HiSeq customers – can you talk a little bit about any mix dynamics there in terms of low throughput versus high throughput labs, 2500 versus older customers? And anything, I guess, we should be thinking about in terms of the pacing of GRAIL orders throughout the course of the year? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure. Hey, Tycho. So as we look at where the orders came in in Q1, I'd say the majority were HiSeq legacy customers as we pointed out. About 40% came from customers who are just HiSeq X customers, so the large genome centers, for example, and then about 10% were new to sequencing. And so, we were really encouraged to see sort of the broad mix of customers, validating the thesis that there is an upgrade cycle in progress here that's starting from HiSeq, but that the NovaSeq platform is also attractive to HiSeq X customers, especially as four comes out later in the year. We're also starting to have conversations with people who are entering the high throughput space with the promise of what NovaSeq can do around certain projects. So, early indications but it was good to see customers from a number of segments sign up to NovaSeq. In terms of GRAIL... Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Go ahead. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. In terms of GRAIL, we talked about the fact that over the course of the year, we expect less than 1% of our company revenue to come from GRAIL, and we still expect that. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC And then can you help us on the 2Q guide? You're coming in $0.20 lower than the Street. Is that all higher OpEx? And can you maybe talk about what those incremental investments largely are? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. Hi, Tycho. This is Sam. So, I think some of the dynamics that we saw in Q1, specifically with regards to gross margin, we expect to see again in Q2. As we ramp up the production of NovaSeq, as we ramp up the manufacturing, as we also see some of the transition in consumables with the customers whether it's validating their workflows, depleting inventories, we expect to see similar gross margin profile in Q2 – actually slightly lower in Q2. So I think that's a key driver. There is some operating expense growth as well that drives the EPS as well. So, I think those are the key drivers in terms of the sequential Q1 to Q2 EPS. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And not nearly as meaningful, but just Helix will continue to ramp sequentially as well. Just more of a small impact, though. Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. If I could squeeze one more in because it's an important question we're getting a lot. It's just on the cross-contamination, barcoding issues, Francis. Can you maybe just comment on that and I'll hop off? Thanks. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure, Tycho. So, we've been working with a couple of customers who've experienced elevated levels of this index swapping on the HiSeq 4000. We don't expect it to have an impact on the NovaSeq demand trajectory going forward. As background, we have seen low levels of index swapping in the 0.1% to 2% range. And that's been sort of a part of the noise, if you like, in (19:44) now ever since the GA at a very low level. It has really no meaningful impact on sequencing results for the vast majority of applications, and there are a number of best practices, including using washers to remove free adapters from libraries, using unique dual indexes that further reduce even this low level of index swapping. We have been engaged with a couple of customers in the last quarter that have seen elevated levels of index swapping on the HiSeq 4000. We've been working with them to understand the specifics of their situation and share best practices that will help mitigate the issues that they're seeing. As we think about NovaSeq, I said we don't expect to see an issue, and the offering we have coming out later this year that will help customers address individual lanes will help mitigate this issue even further because it will lower the level of multiplexing that you need to do on NovaSeq. Operator And another question... Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. Sorry. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. Recognizing it's still early, is NovaSeq driving any increased demand from biopharmaceutical customers? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hey, Doug. At this stage, it's too early to call sort of an industry trend like that, so it's certainly driven a lot of conversations, but again, too early probably to call out a specific trend like that. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. (21:24) Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Regarding the develop – oh, go ahead. I'm sorry, Rebecca. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. No problem. I was just going to say outside of Regeneron that we highlighted is one of the initial customers at JPMorgan. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you for that. Regarding the development of the workflow to allow for multichannel loading of NovaSeq flow cells, is this largely to accommodate some of the smaller core labs that were concerned about number of samples required to make the economics work on the NovaSeq? And I guess on your website, you indicated you decided to make this new workflow available based on customer feedback, factor again this feedback, how much demand do you think this change opens up in terms of market opportunity? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure. So, this new offering does help address a number of things, including some of things you talked about. What it does is it allows customers to run experiments with samples that have lower DNA inputs. It allows them to run different applications across the different flow cells. So, it gives you a number of things that customers have wanted that they've given us feedback on since we launched the NovaSeq. In general, these are sort of incremental improvements to the NovaSeq platform. And so, we shouldn't expect a dramatic change in the demand trajectory associated with NovaSeq because of these improvements. They are good but they're not going to change fundamentally the demand trajectory. And also, this comes out in Q4. And so, it really shouldn't have much impact on 2017 at all. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks for that. One last quick one and then I'll get back in the queue. Given the stage where you are in the product rollout and the manufacturing ramp, I know in your prepared remarks you talked again about the expected manufacturing constraints progressing through the supply chain, is it fair to assume that was a full quarter of production that you could at least double the number of NovaSeq placements in the second quarter? Thank you. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. So, I'll start by saying I touched on this in the prepared remarks, but we're very happy with where we are at the end of Q1. Obviously, an instrument like NovaSeq is a brand-new architecture from the ground up. And so it was a very big task to scale up the manufacturing process on something like a NovaSeq. And so, as we close out the quarter, we shipped just over 25 instruments and not only are we happy with the number, but we are also very happy with the quality of the instruments and the quality of the data that our customers are seeing. We expect to continue to ramp, as we said, over Q2 and Q3. And over Q3 we expect to be at the stage where we are – we expect to exit Q3 at the stage where we're meeting the incoming order demand. I think that we haven't given specific guidance in terms of the manufacturing for Q2, but something along the lines of what you talked about seems reasonable. Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks again. Operator The next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker Hey, guys. It's Luke (24:44) in for Ross today. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hey, Luke (24:47). Unknown Speaker I guess, as you look at the evolution of the sequencing market and as it's gone all the way back to the GA, and now we're pushing on the edge of clinical sequencing, how has the feedback from customers kind of shaped your medium-term opportunity? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. As you point out, we've seen these step changes in the market before as we put out the GA and the HiSeq and the HiSeq X. And so we come in to this with that experience. And so far I would say that NovaSeq has played well to our expectations, that we expected NovaSeq to drive an upgrade cycle in our high throughput customer base starting that with the HiSeq customers and then to the HiSeq X customers and that starting to play out as we talked about in the quarter, we do think now that this will drive – with the data we have, this will drive that upgrade cycle in our legacy customers. We've also talked about the fact that we expect NovaSeq with its power and its price points to drive the elasticity of the market. And it is early, but there are indications we're getting from our customers in terms of new projects that have been announced like the Regeneron-Glaxo project for the Biobank in the UK. Those kinds of projects as well as ultra-deep sequencing project in the oncology market as well as liquid biopsy sequencing. So, three months, it's early data. But the early data is very consistent with the hypothesis we had when we embarked on the development cycle for NovaSeq. Unknown Speaker Great. Thanks. Operator And the next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi. Good afternoon. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Derik. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch So, you mentioned 20 HiSeqs came out of the mix during the quarter in your genetics accelerate (26:48). Do have any sort of estimates for where the HiSeq number will end up be in VRM (26:54)? I'm trying to get to the swap ratio and sort of what's the indication from customers that have bought so far or so far of what – how many HiSeqs are going to pull out for the Novas? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Derik, we don't provide that number. And so, I guess, mostly what we can do to help you is sort of give you the qualitative results that we've talked about that we are seeing an earlier then maybe slightly earlier than expected conversation with the HiSeq X customers in terms of looking at NovaSeq. We certainly expect as S4 comes out, that we will see HiSeq X customers moving or re-platforming to NovaSeq. At this point, I don't have any data to give you – I can share with you around ratios. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And, Derik, part of the reason for that is, effectively, some customers are just testing out NovaSeq, so they aren't necessarily thinking about the ratio for the entirety of their fleet. Other customers are further down that path. And so the variance between customers is quite wide. Additionally, for us to take something out of the installed base, it needs to really not be used, right? And so, that's not something that really we can forecast at this point in time, because many customers do keep these boxes installed until they're not being used for quarters upon quarters. And so, that's more of a retroactive look and not necessarily something that we can forecast. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Got it. Right. And then, a quick follow-up on that. You said the consumable pull-down was a little bit more than you thought in terms of slower and – attributing that to more inventory reduction rather than delays in terms of the sequencing market, I agree with you, but I was just wondering if you did any – found any evidence at all that certainly the funding uncertainty in the market is having any issues? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. I've not heard from anywhere that the funding uncertainty is what's driving the consumable slowdown. What we do know is that we initiated conversations with our high throughput customers and that has caused our customers to do a number of things. One, they are pausing, so they can talk to us about NovaSeq. They are drawing down existing inventory with the understanding that they are likely just sort of re-platforming the future. They're also not doing any large future buys for the same reason. And then initially, there will be the smaller purchases as they validate the workflows associated with the NovaSeq. And so, those are expected steps. And so, that's what's driving the slowdown that we saw in the consumables. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Great. Thank you. Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc. Having said that, I'll just point out that Q1 is normally a strong order quarter for consumables, sequencing consumables in general. And we did see some backlog build there as well from our customers. So, those who aren't slowing down at least are still placing orders and expecting those to be shipped throughout the year. Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thank you. Operator And the next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. Hi guys. Thank you. Francis, can you just talk about the back half of the year? Any assumptions around the HiSeq X system pull-through once the S4 configuration is out there and presumably folks start doing holds more (30:14) on the Nova? Are you still thinking you can exit the year with the HiSeq X still in the $625,000 to $725,000 range? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. So, we are not expecting those pull-through ranges to sort of carry forward as we go through this transition period. And so, I talked a little bit about the dynamics that are playing out and the high throughput market in terms of people looking to re-platform to NovaSeq and that is affecting the kinds of orders that they will be placing and the work that they'll be doing as they transition on to the NovaSeq platform. We are also expecting very little in terms of new X placements, obviously, as we look at Q2 going forward. And so, that will have some impact in the back half of the year overall as well. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And, Dan, we said on the Q4 call that we had suspended that range. And so, this isn't necessarily a change in messaging. It's effectively just the continuation of that messaging where we don't necessarily have a HiSeq or HiSeq X guidance range at this point in time because this transition is dynamic. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. And so, what you can expect to see is that this is going to be the transition year. And then, as we go through sort of a four-quarter period on NovaSeq, we'll be in a better position to start to talk to you about what you can expect on NovaSeq. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thanks. And maybe just following up on your comments, Francis, on HiSeq versus HiSeq X customers in your order book, can you just sort of further that thought by talking about how many of the 85 or so orders beyond the 49 that you announced in January came from conversion of the HiSeq X backlog? I think there were 35 or 40 in the backlog as of 4Q. Just curious how many of those traded up. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. We haven't done the breakdown on the post-49... (32:03) Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. I guess, 49 to the greater than 135 (32:05). I think the overall number is generally representative. I'd say, so I don't know – I haven't done the breakdown for the post, but I don't expect this incremental insight to come from that breakdown. Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thanks very much. Operator And the next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Please go ahead. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks. I just had a couple of follow-ups to some of the questions that have been asked. So, I guess first on the replacement cycle more broadly, so you've talked to some of the demand that might have been a bit surprising for the legacy platforms outside of the HiSeq X. So, I'm just curious, I guess, does that demand change your view ultimately on what the magnitude of the replacement cycle could look like for the NovaSeq or the timing? And then, just if you have any updates on your thoughts around supporting or I guess offering the legacy platforms? I think you've made comments about HiSeq 2500, but some of the other HiSeqs? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure. I'll start by saying that we still deeply believe that NovaSeq will drive an upgrade cycle off our HiSeq customer base and over time our HiSeq X customer base. And so, we talked about the fact that we have 800 HiSeq customers. And we have north of 30 HiSeq X customers. We deeply believe that, and everything that's happened in Q1 in my mind sort of reaffirms that thesis for us. What we saw in Q1 was we saw slightly stronger than expected demand, we said, for HiSeq X and for HiSeq, and what was playing out there, where there are customers that are in the midst of running large whole genome projects, and they needed more capacity. And what they didn't want to do was switch platforms in the middle of a project. And so, they added capacity and they added Xs. We also saw some customers in China that continue to buy Xs because in that region it's a very competitive platform. And until we get to the S4, it's going to continue to be a very competitive platform. And then we had some clinical customers that have their validated workflows that are sticking with the platform that they are using. We think these are transition effects. I think they drop off very quickly even in Q2. And so, it doesn't really change our thesis around the upgrade cycle. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. That makes sense... (34:33) Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. ...position on what our portfolio plan around the instruments we're looking to retire, that doesn't change. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. And I just had one other follow-up to Tycho's question on margin. So, just thinking about when you have the NovaSeq sort of up and running. Can you give us some, at least, qualitative commentary on the right way to think about the margin profile on the NovaSeq when you – from an instrumentation consumable perspective, particularly given that you're obviously launching higher performance cells and single loading cells going forward? Just on a sort of more sustainable basis. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Sure, Amanda. This is Sam. So, I think the way to look at NovaSeq margin profile from an instrument standpoint, I think it's slightly lower margin than our HiSeq platform, and I think as we go forward in the year and as manufacturing ramps up, the margin profile on the instrument will improve, but it will still be slightly below the HiSeq X instrument and the HiSeq profile. So, there will definitely be an improvement in the instrument margin as we go through the year, but it will still be below the HiSeq platform, higher than the benchtop platform though. From a consumable standpoint, I think the important part is that as we ramp up consumables in the second half of the year, we also expect to see a margin profile on the consumables that's on par with our high throughput consumables. Amanda Louise Murphy - William Blair & Co. LLC Okay. Thanks very much. Operator And the next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I also wanted to follow up on one of Tycho's questions. You mentioned 10% of NovaSeq customers are new to sequencing. Is that what you thought the uptake would be like compared to previous new product launches and any other data points around new customer interest would be great? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. I mean that was a good number. It wasn't a hugely surprising number. Given the dynamics that we are seeing, we did expect some new customers to be created in the high throughput segment. Some of them are regionally oriented, so we're seeing new customers, for example, emerge in China. Some of them driven by the opportunity created by the Chinese Precision Medicine Initiative. So, the number wasn't really that surprising. And we expect to see some of that going forward. Obviously, most of the new-to-sequencing customers typically show up at the lower end of our portfolio, so 60% of the MiniSeq, MiSeq level of our customers coming in there are new-to-sequencing customers. But at the top end, 10% is not too surprising. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Got it. And then just as a follow-up. I wanted to ask about the service revenue strength in the quarter. It looks like it was coming through the microarray line. Just any color there would be great, or broader trends around service revenue. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Sure, Jack. Yeah, absolutely, it was coming in from the microarray line, and it's driven by the real strength we're seeing in the consumer market. And so, it's related to the services that we offer to the consumer market, which now for many quarters has been a strong segment for us. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Operator And the next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. Great. Good afternoon everyone. This is Alex Nowak on for Bill today. So, the 135 orders surpassed your expectations but you also reiterated top-line guidance. So I'm just wondering if you could reconcile the two. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. The 135 orders was slightly better than we were expecting for Q1, but it's still very early in the year. We still have – the majority of the work to do for the year is still in front of us. This is still a back-end loaded year for us. And so, while we are happy with the way Q1 played out, we feel it's too early to change anything for the whole year. Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. Thank you. And then the second question for me. What gives you confidence that there's enough sequencing demand that NovaSeq's consumable sales pull-through for instrument will be about the same if not better than HiSeq? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. There are a few things. One is our experience now in this market across the introduction of multiple high throughput platforms has given us a track record now of seeing what happens with our customers that as we give customers high-throughput capacity, they are able to embark on more ambitious sequencing-intensive projects. And so, in previous platforms, customers were able to go from panels to exomes, from exomes to genomes with the HiSeq X. And what we're hearing from customers now is that more customers want to go from exomes to genomes. So, not just the HiSeq X customers, but now our HiSeq customers want to do that. And the HiSeq 4000 is good, but the NovaSeq really enables that. In addition, they're giving us examples of projects in areas like single cell or wanting to do much, much deeper sequencing for tumor normals or liquid biopsies or other applications where they're effectively looking for the uncommon needle in a haystack type of events. And so we're getting feedback from our customers around the projects that they want to embark on, which is consistent with the experience we had in this market before. And now, as we come out of Q1, it's clear that customers are buying a high throughput platform because they intended to use the capabilities that come from a high throughput platform. So, as they purchase, they have plans around which one they want to utilize the platform for and they have expectations that it will be a reasonably utilized platform, too. And so, now we have a few months of data now coming to us with customers reacting to a specific platform. And that's very consistent with our thesis (40:42). Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co. Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi, guys. Thank you. Francis, I had a question for you on the consumer market. I think the FDA recently took a more dovish stance with regards to consumer testing for things like risk assessment and so just wondering if – just given that that was a relatively new development, if there's anything baked into your guidance this year with regards to an acceleration in those types of markets? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. That was a really good step forward, we think, for the consumer market. We are really happy about the impact it's going to have definitely and immediately on 23andMe. But we think it's a very good sign for the entire consumer market. So, Ancestry, Helix and everybody else, and that obviously is good for us, too. Now, we have known that 23andMe has been working on this for a while. And so, while it was news obviously when it happened, it's not entirely unexpected from our perspective. And so, it's consistent with our view of how the consumer market is likely to play out over the course of this year. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up. I think all the questions around NovaSeq were pretty well covered. So, I want to maybe focus on the other parts of the portfolio, on the instrument side, specifically, Firefly. I think you guys gave a little bit of an update in January regarding performance specs and timeline for end of year. Just wondering if that's still on track and any evolved thoughts on what that product line ultimately means for your expansion of the opportunity? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. The team is making very good progress on Firefly even since the update we gave in January. As we talked about in January, the intent is to bring out the sequencing box end of this year, beginning of next year and then bring out the library print box about a year later, and the team is on track to do that. This is one of the fortunate situations where we've announced the product well before bringing it into the market. And one of the reasons to do that was to allow us to engage with prospective customers. And the team has been doing that. And so, it's starting to get a good sense for the customer segments that it will be applicable for and what's particularly exciting is they're identifying customer segments that may be new to sequencing that are attracted to Firefly. And so, good progress, on track with the timelines that we talked about in January. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. Thanks a bunch. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Thank you, Isaac. Operator And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Steve. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Close enough. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. So, first question is on consumables, in sequencing consumables. Sam, could you put any more granularity around what you saw in the first quarter and the impact of some of these dynamics around Nova and the way customers are thinking about the transition? I mean, given that you have – I would imagine a pretty good handle on who the customers are, do you have any idea of what sequencing consumables growth might have looked like on an apples-to-apples basis in a scenario where we didn't have the Nova transition? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. It's hard to give you kind of the apples-to-apples comparison that you're asking for, but let me give you a little bit of color, at least, in terms of what we saw in Q1 and expectations going forward. I think what we saw is basically almost what we expected which is, as Francis mentioned before, customers essentially validating their workflows, pausing, depleting some of their inventories. And we think that played into the lower sequencing consumable volumes that we saw in the quarter. And we think this is expected, given the rebalancing to a new platform, which is NovaSeq. And as we look forward, specifically to the second half, I think the expectation is that we would see a ramp-up in consumables. Now, as we said, going into Q1, that consumable growth is going to essentially decelerate given some of that time that customers will need to ramp up on their consumable purchases of NovaSeq. But essentially it's playing out as we pretty much expected, maybe slightly lower consumables on the HiSeq, HiSeq X compared to what we had expected. But as we look forward, we think that that's – our expectations are that we will see consumables ramp up with the NovaSeq uptick. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. In the back half of the year. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. In the back half. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And one thing to add to that, Steve, is there is absolutely nothing that we've heard from our customers that would lead us to believe that there's anything going on with regard to sequencing consumables beyond this natural transition. We have seen very, very large customers work down their inventories on hand, which led to the sequential decline in the high throughput component of the portfolio. So I think that is absolutely on par with our expectations. To Sam's point, maybe a little bit quicker than we had expected, but that is aligned with HiSeq X customers exceeding our expectations with NovaSeq. So, it's all one and the same in terms of the drivers. And on an apples-to-apples basis, ex the NovaSeq transition, we would expect nothing beyond the traditional formula of what sequencing consumables would do in any given quarter. Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. I appreciate all the color there. And just one follow-up here and that relates to the operating expense where there has been some commentary in the prepared remarks on adding new feet on the street, if you will, new folks throughout the organization. I wonder if you could spend a minute just talking about where these people are headed. Then maybe if you could compare head count growth that you're thinking about for the company in 2017 relative to the last couple of years, just as we think about the modeling, that would be a big help. Thanks again. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. So, one of the areas we are going to be adding feet on the street is around focusing on the low end part of our portfolio, the benchtop instruments. So, we're looking to add an inside sales team, expand the inside sales team that focuses on that part of the portfolio, additional lead generation capability to drive leads into that part of the portfolio. You, as a customer, would have already seen the investments we've made in e-commerce. So, that's come online in the past few months, and we're going to continue to invest there because we think there's a real opportunity to improve the customer experience, as well as improve the velocity at which we do deals, and our cost to serve by moving the – part of the consumables part of our business as well as the low end portfolio through e-commerce. And so, those are some of the areas that you can expect to see us expand our capacity. Marc A. Stapley - Illumina, Inc. I would just add geographically in China as well as a major investment for us this year. Operator And our next question comes from Puneet Souda from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Just one briefly – I just wanted to understand a little bit, I think it's been covered – parts of it had been covered before. But as the installs that are already happened, some of them have gone through the validation. If you could talk about and maybe give color on how labs are designing experiments? I'm sure there are some labs that are transitioning from validation to designing their own experiments on this. Are they simply waiting for S4, or are they in the meantime using the S2 flow cell to try to do some of these experiments? And does that – and taking on some of the production samples on to S2 and does that change your view at all on timing of S4 and maybe potentially moving that up? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. So, I'd say that if you think about the makeup of the people who bought NovaSeq, I said, the majority of them were legacy HiSeq customers. And so, for them the move to S2 is a beneficial move on its own. And so, they're certainly not waiting for S4 and nor do they need to. And so, we expect the people who bought NovaSeq will start to sequence on S2 and very few (49:26) will be waiting for S4 before they start sequencing. Obviously, if you are a HiSeq X customer, you're designing very large experiments. The S4 is a really exciting flow cell for you. And it was actually that feedback we got from customers when we launched the NovaSeq that caused us to pull the S4 in from Q4 to Q3. And so, that's our plan of record, and that's the plan that we're going to stick to, but it was very much driven by the higher-than-expected interest we got in S4 from HiSeq X customers, certainly. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Okay, got that. And then just a one quick follow-up. Could you update us on the manufacturing ramp? I mean, there is – obviously, the HiSeqs are getting essentially reduced in some of the facilities, the San Diego, the Bay Area, the Singapore and Cambridge facility and the Wisconsin facility that you have. So, just trying to understand how are you ramping up NovaSeq and re-tooling some of those facilities to ramp up on both flow cells and the instruments. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. (50:38) NovaSeq is a completely brand-new architecture, and every major component is a brand-new component in NovaSeq. And so, it has been a really big effort on behalf of our operations team to ramp up our manufacturing capability on NovaSeq and transition that product from product development into our operations team. And I am incredibly proud of the terrific work that team has done in getting to where we are and allowing us to be slightly ahead of where we expected to be, as we got out of Q1. The way we think about our facilities broadly is a lot of our new introduction work happening here in the U.S. close to the development centers, and that's consistent with how we're thinking about ramping up NovaSeq. And that's sort of how we're thinking about it. Puneet Souda - Leerink Partners LLC Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Dan Leonard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thank you. Just wanted to clarify. Well, two questions. The first one, clarification on gross margin. Sam, I think you mentioned that the promotions and the high throughput sequencing market were part of the depression on gross margin in the quarter. Can you clarify what you're doing in the promotional space and the high throughput market and why that would continue in Q2? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Well, as we ramp up NovaSeq and for some of the customers that have ordered HiSeq in the past, we've said that we were going to have a promotion where we would match some of the prices. So we have – essentially that's had a negative impact on ASP on some of our high throughput instruments. So, that's primarily the reason... Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. In the first quarter, but that's just not expected to continue into the second quarter, Dan. The second quarter impact is more along the line of the ramping NovaSeq – effectively mix... Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. So... Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. ...in the sequencing instrument line. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Right. So that's the second part, which is as we move forward, it's really a question of NovaSeq ramping up in terms of production. And until the volumes catch up in Q3 and Q4, we're going to continue to see some negative impact on gross margin in Q2 because of that. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. That's what I wanted to clarify. Thank you. And then my follow-up question. Can you offer us an update on what percentage of your revenue is China? And you're going to be rolling up again some pretty tough comps in the second half from China, and whether you expect the growth rate to continue at the levels you've been seeing? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. We remain bullish on the Chinese market opportunity. Roughly, you should think about it already around 10% of our business. And the secular drivers of the market there continue to be positive. So, we're seeing growth in the clinical markets associated with both NIPT and oncology, and that played out last year. We expect – that trend is continuing to play out this year. We're also seeing demand driven by the government's Precision Medicine Initiative. So, money has started flowing. Projects are being funded, and that is causing customers to purchase our instruments, that's causing in some cases new customers to be created. And all that is going to continue to play out, certainly over the course of this year, but likely for a few years. In this quarter, Annoroad just got clearance from the CFDA around its assay, and that will continue to give it momentum in the market. And so, it's a market we are excited about. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. And just one thing to highlight with regard to our outperformance in the region last year, obviously, we'll have a challenging comp as we go throughout the course of this year and the benefit of HiSeq X instrument sales in particular that we saw last year. So, just to take that into account, I completely echo Francis' statements with that caveat. Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator And our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Thank you. I don't want to neglect the desktop lines – benchtop lines rather. Can you talk about whether your pull-through there was within the guidance ranges for each of those and also comment on the level of placements, were they kind of up, down or flat relative to the back half 2016? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. The pull-through numbers were consistent with the ranges that we provided. And the (55:15) numbers were roughly in line with where we expected. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. And then the weakness in Europe, can you just talk – maybe give a little color around that. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc. The weakness in Europe was primarily driven by the NovaSeq transition and the challenge – they had a good Q1 shipment number last year. I wouldn't call it weakness in Europe. I would call it more they met their forecast and plans. Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Thanks. Operator And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Bryan. Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Hi. Good afternoon. So you mentioned the solid 20% growth in oncology in your prepared remarks. Is a large piece of that growth coming from the TST 170, or if you elaborate on what's the underlying driver of that? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. TST 170 is a piece of it, but it's certainly not a big piece of it. I mean, it's a fairly new product to the market. And so you should expect to see that ramp. But in Q1 it was certainly not a big piece of the growth we're seeing. We are continuing to see strength in the translation of market in oncology, driven by the large cancer centers. We talked about the growth we're seeing driven by the adoption of liquid biopsy market of sequencing. So, those are some of the variables that played out much more so than TST 170. Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities All right. And would you expect that piece of the market to adopt the NovaSeq, and therefore, could there be any sort of a hiccup in oncology as those customers transition over to that system? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. I certainly expect over time given that some of the applications we're talking about includes things like very deep sequencing for tumor normal or for liquid biopsies. So, I expect over time, NovaSeq will be attractive to a segment of the market, but we're seeing enough growth from other parts of the market that I'm not sure that you should expect to see a pause in this market at all. I don't think it will just the wholesale adoption of NovaSeq. I mean, there's so many different types of customers that are buying that. I think it will just continue to see growth in that market. Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Okay. Thank you very much. Operator And our next question comes from Catherine from Baird. Please go ahead. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Hi. Hi. Thanks for the question. Catherine Schulte here. Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. Hi, Catherine. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Are you accepting S4 orders in advance of that launch? Are those included in the 135-order number? And then will you have initial manufacturing constraints for the S4 when it launches or will it immediately be able to meet demand? Francis A. deSouza - Illumina, Inc. The way to think about the 135-order is that people are buying the platform. And initially, they will buy S2 because that's the flow cell that's available, and then they will buy – some of them may buy S4 flow cells when it becomes available. But they're not buying it and then waiting for S4. That's not how they are thinking about it. What was the second part of your question? (58:22) Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Will there be initial manufacturing constraints for S4? Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. I don't think so. I think the bigger constraint will be just on the platform, and that's the constraint that we're working through. I expect that as we bring S4 out, we should be able to ramp up to meet demand. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Okay. And then for NovaSeq orders, can you just describe the cadence of those throughout the quarter and entering the second quarter? I know you had a lot buzz around the JPMorgan Conference, but just talk about how those progressed over time. Sam A. Samad - Illumina, Inc. Yeah. I think, it is interesting. It's been non-linear. It's probably the best way to describe it in the few days before JPMorgan and in some cases actually in the few hours before JPMorgan, as I had personally reached out to a small set of customers and then a couple of other people reached out to a couple of others. And so we were able to come out of the gate and talk about the commitments we've had from that first set of customers. And so, we were able to come out of the gate and talk about the commitments we had from that first set of customers. For everyone else, including everyone in the Illumina commercial organization, the first time really they heard about NovaSeq was when it was announced on stage at JPMorgan. And so, in some sense that was sort of the starting gun for our entire commercial organization. And we had immediately planned that day a set of training webinars and a marketing campaign ready to go, our road shows that literally took off that week around the globe to start to explain to our field and to our customers what NovaSeq was. And so, we got that initial bolus of customers in the few days and the few hours before JPMorgan. And then we started the sales process. And so, it's a period when we weren't getting any orders because we were still teaching our own team and teaching the rest of the world what NovaSeq was. And so, that started to play out in the weeks after we launched. And so it really started to come to fruition, if you like, in March primarily where those conversations started to play out into orders. I mean, roughly, obviously, there are exceptions, but that's roughly how it played out. Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Really helpful. Thank you. Operator And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to Rebecca Chambers for final remarks. Rebecca Chambers - Illumina, Inc.
