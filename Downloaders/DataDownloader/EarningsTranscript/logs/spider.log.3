Schatz Thank you, John. Hello, and welcome to our call today to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2014 and the progress we are making to accelerate innovation and growth. We have a lot of news to share with you today. First, on the results, adjusted net sales were up 5% at constant exchange rates, which was in line with our communicated full year 2014 target for 4% to 5% constant exchange rate growth. Excluding U.S. sales of our HPV test or human papilloma virus test used for cervical cancer screening, our portfolio grew about 9% constant exchange rate growth. Adjusted operating income grew 7%, and adjusted EPS of $0.22 per share was in line with our target as well. We're making progress on delivering important regulatory approvals and new product launches, especially among the 5 growth drivers. We are pleased to announce the FDA clearance of the full QIAsymphony RGQ MDx automation platform and the clearance for the C. difficile assay for detection of this life-threatening infection. We're working on up to about 10 additional U.S. and European submissions this year. Another is the China approval and successful launch of the QuantiFERON latent TB test. Our bioinformatics solutions, such as the new CLC Cancer Research Workbench, are delivering the data analysis and interpretation needed to make sense of complex data; and the new universal pre-analytics, such as the REPLI-g Single Cell Kits, are improving access to nucleic acids in challenging biologic samples. On GeneReader, our teams have been making progress in addressing the challenges to developing this NGS bench-top workflow into a complete sample-to-insight system, targeting the needs of customers in clinical research and diagnostics. Market entry is expected in 12 to 18 months, and the initial focus will be partnering with customers in biomedical research, clinical research and clinical diagnostics. As you see on this slide, we have announced the authorization for a third $100 million share repurchase program. This is a signal of our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We have also announced some changes in the supervisory board. As you know and as planned, Professor Dr. Detlev Riesner, a cofounder of Qiagen and Chairman of the Board since 2003, has stepped down as Chairman, and Dr. Werner Brandt has taken over as Chairman. We have also announced that Professor Dr. Elaine Mardis, who many of you know, has been nominated to join the board as well. So in summary, we are confident in the start to 2014 and have reaffirmed our goals for the year. I'm now on Slide 5 to provide an overview of results for our 4 customer classes, with all of the classes delivering higher sales. In Molecular Diagnostics, we saw good double-digit growth from our portfolio when excluding the U.S. HPV test sales and generated more than 1/3 of total sales. Among the 5 growth drivers, sales of consumables used on the QIAsymphony system are advancing a strong double-digit growth, and we also saw higher QIAsymphony instrument sales in the quarter as well and are on the track to add more than 250 placements this year. QuantiFERON-TB, the modern gold standard for latent TB detection, has continued to grow above our 20% constant exchange rate target. Given that the overall market is still less than 10% penetrated, we are focusing on targeted market segments, particularly congregated living, such as the military and prisons. In the U.S., we continue to gain sales due to the ongoing shortages of materials required for the 120-year-old skin test. Our Personalized Healthcare portfolio posted higher sales in the first quarter, overcoming the U.S. reimbursement challenges during 2013 for companion diagnostic kits. We have been very pleased with the pace of new co-development agreements being reached with pharma companies. In prevention, U.S. sales of HPV testing products declined about 27% in the first quarter and represented about 9% of total sales, and this was in line with our full year expectations as we absorbed the impact of pricing pressure and the non-exclusive transition of a U.S. customer to a competitor test. As for HPV sales in the rest of the world, we've been very successful and winning, by far, most of the new tenders, but saw delivery timing impact results in the first quarter. In the Life Sciences, all of the customer classes showed improving sales, with underlying growth further supported by the bioinformatics contributions from Ingenuity and CLC bio. The outstanding growth in Applied Testing came from double-digit growth in both consumables and instruments. A key driver here has been consumables contributions from the surge of QIAsymphony placements in 2012 and the ongoing expansion of our Human ID and forensics business. Pharma saw double-digit expansion in instrument sales, along with a single-digit improvement in consumables. Like others, we are watching the M&A actions in the pharma industry, which came on top of the ongoing restructuring activities. In Academia, following the pressures in 2013 on U.S. and European government research funding, we are starting to see some modestly improving trends. However, we continue to expect funding levels to remain below those seen in recent years. In the U.S., like you have heard from other companies, we also felt the adverse impact of at least 5 federal government business days lost due to the winter weather on the East Coast, but sales turned out to be largely at about the same level as a year ago. We also expect the much-anticipated 2014 NIH budget funding to become available in the second half of the year. I would like to now hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I'm on Slide 6 and would like to review our results for the quarter. Adjusted net sales were $317.4 million, rising 5% at constant exchange rate and also on a reported basis. We saw some currency headwind from the Japanese yen and various emerging market currencies in the first quarter, but this was largely offset by strong euro-denominated sales. About 3 percentage points of growth came from the Ingenuity and CLC bio acquisition and about 2 percentage points from the rest of the business. And remember that results include about 4 percentage points of headwind from declining HPV test sales in the U.S. Even with lower HPV sales, the adjusted gross margin remained steady at about 72% of sales. We are seeing a shift towards more consumables, and the expansion in bioinformatics, which has gross margins well above the company average and is also supporting this trend as well. Adjusted operating income grew 7%, at a faster rate than sales. R&D investments were higher as a percentage of sales in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, but we achieved margin gains in sales and marketing and also in general and administrative expenses. So these are signs of benefits from our productivity initiatives. As a result, the adjusted operating margin improved by about 60 basis points and was about 24% of sales. Adjusted net income rose at an even faster 12-percentage pace, and the $0.22 of adjusted EPS and the tax rate of 22% were both in line with our goals for the quarter. In terms of adjusted EPS, we did not see any meaningful net currency impact in the quarter, but we still expect a potential adverse impact on the full year results. I will come back to this topic later. I'm now on Slide 7, which shows that all regions grew in the first quarter of the year. The Asia-Pacific/Japan region led the performance, growing 11% constant exchange rate and providing about 19% of sales. Japan grew at a double-digit pace, supported by strong spending trend at the end of their fiscal year and we also saw solid growth in South Korea. China showed modest growth in this quarter, but we expect better trends in the second half of the year. About 47% of sales came from the Americas, rising 4% constant exchange rate and more than overcoming lower sales of HPV product in the U.S. and also in Latin America, which faced a tougher comparison against national product deliveries in the first quarter of 2013. In the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, which provides about 1/3 of our sales, the 3% constant exchange rate growth in sales was led by France, the United Kingdom and the Nordic region, which continues to enjoy growth after strong performance in 2013. In the top 7 emerging markets, adjusted net sales were up 4% constant exchange rates, which is lower than typical for these countries. Sales growth was solid in Brazil, South Korea, Turkey and India, but growth was again more modest in China and much weaker in Russia and Mexico than in the first quarter a year ago. We see these emerging market results as a temporary issue and look for improving sales during the year. I'm now on Slide 8 and will provide a few comments on consumables and instruments. Consumables and other revenues rose 5% constant exchange rate in the first quarter and provided about 89% of sales, and this shows that we are seeing a shift in the product mix towards higher-margin product, including bioinformatics, that just further supports this trend. After a single-digit decline in 2013, instrument sales are off to a better start in 2014 and were up 3% constant exchange rates in the first quarter. We continued to see adverse funding trends in Academia. But all of the other customer classes delivered improvement, and this included higher sales contribution from the QIAsymphony automation platform. I'm now on the Slide 9 and would like to give some insights on the convertible bond transactions that we successfully completed in the first quarter of 2014. We see many positive elements for equity holders since these transactions strengthen our balance sheet and secure attractive long-term financing. As a reminder, we first repurchased about $294 million of the $300 million issued 2026 convertible notes. These had a coupon 3.25 percentage points, which is far higher than the new notes and was in the money with a conversion price of $20 per share. That meant we face dilution of about 15 million shares once these bonds were converted. We are extinguishing the remaining $6 million of notes, which are cleanup costs [ph]. Second, we raised $730 million at very low rate of 0.375 percentage points for the 2019 notes and 0.875 percentage points for the 2021 notes. A portion of these proceeds were used to establish cost spread overlay, which increased the conversion price of the new notes to about USD 32. On a net basis, we raised about $300 million of proceeds, again, at very low rate. In terms of interest expenses, this will decline on an adjusted basis for the full year 2014, but will rise on a reported basis due to noncash interest expense triggered by the way the convertible bonds are accounted for in this respective standard. The adjustments being made are in line with those of other companies included in our sector. Before the transaction, annual cash interest expense for 2014 was about USD 30 million, net of interest income, and this included about $11 million of cash interest expenses for the 2026 notes. After these transactions, the 2014 cash interest expense is reduced by about USD 5 million to about $25 million. On a reported basis, there is dilution of about $0.06 per share in 2014, of which is about $0.03 of onetime charges were taken in the first quarter. Dilution comes from an additional $8 million of noncash interest expenses related to the new and old convertible notes. So this means that reported interest is about $38 million, and adjusted interest expenses are about $25 million. Also, I want to note that these transactions result in a modest increase in the tax rate for the full year 2014, so that means, all in, no impact on adjusted EPS in 2014 and a slight accretion starting in 2015. In summary, we see this transaction as being in the best interest of our shareholders and put Qiagen in a stronger position. I'm now on Slide 10, with an update on our financial position. As of March 31, 2014, we had liquidity of about USD 680 million, and this shows the net proceeds of the convertible bond transactions. At the same time, our net debt increased to about USD 509 million, so leverage is now at about 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA, which was the same level at the end of 2013. We see Qiagen as continuing to have a healthy financial position, one that provides flexibility to support business expansion as well as to increase returns to shareholders. In terms of cash flow generation, the amounts were essentially the same in the first quarter of 2013 and 2014, respectively, with about $28 million of free cash flow in 2014. This amount for 2014 included approximately $9 million of cash restructuring charges for completions of the efficiency projects done in 2013. However, with the completion of these projects last year, we are targeting significant improvement in cash flow in 2014 and beyond. I would like to now hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes. Thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 11 to provide an update on the progress we are making on strategic initiatives. Our strategy is anchored on expanding our leadership in sample and assay technologies that address the rapidly evolving needs of customers to transform biological samples into valuable molecular insights. These 5 growth drivers are addressing the critical needs of customers across all of the classes as we help drive the dissemination of molecular technologies. Here are points to consider on the growth drivers. The QIAsymphony automation platform is expected to provide about 1 percentage point of incremental sales growth in 2014, and new longer-term impulses are coming from the recent FDA approval of the full workflow and plans for many new test submissions. QuantiFERON is set to break through $100 million of sales in 2014 and could surpass the size of our U.S. HPV franchise. We see enormous growth potential ahead, given that modern latent TB testing is only about 10% penetrated and the total addressable market is estimated at $1 billion. Personalized Healthcare is generating more than $100 million of sales and growing at a good pace, with expectations for higher kit sales and revenues from the companion diagnostic co-development agreements in 2014. Bioinformatics is set to be an important incremental contributor this year as well, as we create an industry-leading portfolio anchored by the combination of teams and products from Ingenuity, CLC bio and Qiagen. And on NGS, we are launching a series of new sample technology kits, as well as expanding our offering in bioinformatics. Together, we see these activities as having well above $50 million of annual sales and strong growth. Qiagen continues to be the unrivaled leader in sample technologies inside next-generation sequencing labs. And here, we mean extracting valuable DNA and RNA from challenging biological samples. We estimate that about 80% of all samples being prepared for use in the sequencer have been created with a Qiagen sample technology kit, and we will continue to expand this market share with new technologies. While NGS is an important trend, keep in mind that less than 1% to 2% of all biological samples being processed in laboratories around the world actually are going into next-gen sequencers, only 1% to 2%. I'm now on to Slide 12, which provides an overview of the many new product approvals and launches during the first year of the -- first quarter of the year. I'd like to focus on 2 of these developments and both involve China. First is the approval of therascreen EGFR kit, which is our first companion diagnostic registered in China, and this comes after a 3-site clinical trial that enrolled more than 1,200 patients with small -- non-small cell lung cancer. This is the most prevalent type of cancer in the country and accounts for roughly 20% of all new cancer cases. We have now gained EGFR assay approvals in the top oncology markets of the world, the U.S., Europe, Japan and now China. This is just the start of our entry into China as we plan to seek registrations for a number of additional assays, including therascreen KRAS for use in colorectal cancer and therascreen B-RAF for use in melanoma. The second approval involves the QuantiFERON latent TB test in China. Given the size of the TB testing market in China, one could say that our entry is admittedly late, but we wanted to first establish our leadership in the U.S. and Europe before moving into other markets. After the launch in late March, we are now ramping up market development activities in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities and targeting specific TB risk groups. These are substantial opportunities in China that could translate into millions of dollars of sales in the coming years, but it is too early to make specific predictions. We have a number of further new product approvals and launches planned for the year, and we'll keep you updated. I'm now on Slide 13, and this shows you the progress we are making on expanding the testing menu. As I mentioned earlier, a highlight is the FDA clearance of the full QIAsymphony RGQ automation platform and the clearance of the artus C. difficile QIAsymphony RGQ kit for the detection of Clostridium difficile, a bacterial infection that is increasingly becoming a public health challenge in the U.S. and many other countries. Gaining clearance for all 3 components of the QIAsymphony system, the SP unit for sample technologies, the AS unit for the assay setup and the Rotor-Gene Q PCR cycler, is an important step towards increasing the utility of this automation platform -- or modular automation platform for customers. More test menu expansion is on the way. We are in the process of doing the 510(k) submission for the artus VanR QIAsymphony RGQ kit for health care-associated infections from vancomycin-resistant bacteria. We have also completed the CE-IVD for this kit as well. Other submissions planned for the year include a U.S. application for the artus Herpes simplex Virus 1/2 QIAsymphony RGQ kit for the diagnosis of Herpes simplex virus 1/2 and also U.S. and European applications for the artus MRSA QIAsymphony RGQ kit for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. We're also on track to achieving our goal for about 250 system placements in 2014, building on the more than 1,000 cumulative placements at the end of 2013. I'm now on Slide 14. A key element of our leadership in Personalized Healthcare is the growing portfolio of co-development and co-commercialization projects that we have with leading pharmaceutical companies. We're often restricted by partners on what we can disclose about the agreement, but we wanted to show you the success of our pharma business development team. First, we now have more than 5 master collaboration agreements in place to develop and commercialize companion diagnostics, including with Lilly and Bayer, and these typically cover the whole company. They lay the ground work for future projects in various therapeutic areas by standardizing interfaces and processes between the organizations. In the last 6 months alone, our teams have brought in about 10 new co-development or co-commercialization projects, and this means we now have more than 20 projects with pharma companies in both oncology and other therapeutic areas. Also on this slide, you see a graphic showing the rapid growth in recent years in terms of the number of clinical trials involving new medicines that are utilizing biomarkers for patient selection and/or stratification. Indeed, it shows that about 45% of oncology trials are now using biomarkers, and this compares about 15% to 20% a decade ago. Our companion diagnostic projects include PCR tests, and we are also discussing NGS options with partners as well. A recent trade publication noted that pharmaceutical companies are using next-gen sequencing for biomarker discovery, but we have been cautious about its use in clinical trials or as a tool for companion diagnostics. This is a view that we can confirm within the pharmaceutical industry. NGS holds many promises for improving the outcome of patients and the technology is developing very quickly, but there are still some limits. They include costs, which is amplified as an issue by the needs for DNA/RNA fusions, methylation, microRNA and other markers in parallel. This is actually prompting pharma companies to push us to consider additional technologies beyond our PCR and NGS offerings that can generate the data they need for clinical trials and even as companion diagnostics in addition to NGS and PCR. In particular, we are hearing request for systems that allow so-called multi-analyte, multimodal testing and that can integrate together various technologies into low-cost tests and that needs to be performed only once to get the test results across all markers. Our priority is to address the evolving needs of our pharma partners and those of pathologists as well. This means we are wed to any -- we are not wed to any one type of technology platform but instead, want to offer a range of workflows and technologies to get the job done. Moving to Slide 15. We are expanding our range of universal solutions for use in next-gen sequencing applications, especially to address bottlenecks in sample technologies and bioinformatics. These are products that can be used with samples going into any sequencer or with any sequence data, and they are also elements of our GeneReader NGS workflow. And as I mentioned earlier, we are planning for market entry in 12 to 18 months of GeneReader but have many universal products coming to market already during 2014 and '15, and they are generating a fast-growing $50 million business in NGS, universal solutions and bioinformatics alone. In terms of sample technologies, among the new products launched are exciting launches in single-cell analytics where the REPLI-g kits that make single cells accessible to next-generation sequencing by amplifying DNA and RNA from individual cells. This is one of the hottest areas of research these days, and we are very quickly seeing strong demand for these products. Related to the launch of new sample technologies is the launch of QIAxpert. This compact microfluidic systems enables customers to assess the quality and quantity of the nucleic acid samples and get detailed information on the quality of the sample and an analysis of the contaminants. Here, we are entering a market with annual sales of about $250 million, mostly served by some very dated technologies. Our teams are also launching new bioinformatic solutions designed to improve data analysis and interpretation. An important product introduction at the AGBT conference in Marco Island was the CLC Cancer Research Workbench and its range of customizable cancer-focused bioinformatic solutions. The early access testing of Ingenuity clinic is also moving ahead, and about 20 clinical laboratories are participating in the program. We showed this solution at the AMP meeting last year and the resonance for a web-based solution that can quickly and effectively visualize treatment options based on data interpretation has been very positive. Moving to Slide 16. I mentioned earlier some important changes to our supervisory board. First, Professor Dr. Detlev Riesner retired as Chairman at a supervisory board meeting held earlier this week. And as previously announced, he will not stand for reelection at the next Annual General Meeting in June. He's a cofounder of Qiagen and was instrumental in our long-term success. I would like to personally thank him, also in the name of all of our employees, for his tremendous support, guidance and collaboration. Dr. Werner Brandt, who has been a member of the supervisory board since 2007 and Chairman of the Audit Committee, has been named Chairman of the supervisory board. With his 30 years of experience in health care and IT, Dr. Brandt provides critical insights at Qiagen and seeks to expand its bioinformatics franchise. And also as previously announced, Dr. Brandt will be retiring this year from his current role as the Chief Financial Officer of SAP AG. We also are extremely pleased to announced that Professor Dr. Elaine Mardis will be nominated for election to the supervisory board at the next Annual General Meeting. Many of you know Dr. Mardis, who's the Co-director and Director of Technology Development at The Genome Institute at Washington University and a very prominent key opinion leader in next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics. Her addition to our board is very timely as well given our initiatives to expand Qiagen's presence in Personalized Healthcare with the adoption of new technologies and bioinformatics to deepen the understanding of cancer and other diseases. With that, I would like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. I'm now on Slide 17 to review our guidance for the second quarter of 2014 and our reaffirmation of our full year guidance as well. As you know, a new adjustment policy took effect with the first quarter of 2014. First, share-based compensation is included as a cost in adjusted results. Second, costs for restructuring are only adjusted when related to business integration and acquisition-related activities. The comparable figures for 2013 are provided in the appendix of this presentation. In terms of guidance for the full year, as mentioned earlier, we continue to expect total sales growth of about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate. This includes a headwind of up to about 4 percentage points for the declining U.S. HPV test sales and for the rest of the business to grow about 8% to 9% constant exchange rate. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow faster than sales and generate at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. We also continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.07 to $1.09 for full year 2014 compared to $1.02 in 2013. Also, I want to note these expectations do not take into account any acquisitions that could be done in 2014. We have given this target for adjusted EPS at constant exchange rates since we continue to see the risk for an adverse currency impact on earnings due to the volatility of some currencies against the dollar. In the first quarter, the stronger euro and British pound essentially netted out the adverse currency impacts of about $5 million on sales in countries where we have a low-cost basis. This includes Japan, Turkey, Brazil and Australia. You can find this information in the appendix to the slide deck. For the second quarter of 2014, adjusted net sales are expected to rise about 4% constant exchange rate, and we expect about $0.24 to $0.25 of adjusted EPS and -- also at constant exchange rates. We have a cautiously optimistic outlook for the second quarter as we look for increasing contributions from our 5 growth drivers. We are also monitoring trends in the life science market, particularly in Asia and the U.S. and have not changed our views on U.S. HPV trend. This slide also contains assumptions for adjustment to results for the second quarter and the full year. For the full year 2014, we expect about $120 million for amortization of acquired intellectual properties, about USD 10 million to USD 15 million for business integration and acquisition items and an adjusted of tax rate of about 20% to 21%, and this is slightly higher than the earlier estimates of 19% to 21% due to the convertible bond transaction. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes. Thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 18 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. We're off to a solid start in 2014 and delivered on targets for higher sales and earnings. We're moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth while also increasing returns to shareholders. Let me review what we have announced. We achieved our targets for the first quarter with our broad portfolio growing at an underlying high-single-digit constant exchange rate growth against the expected weakness in U.S. sales of HPV test. Our 5 growth drivers are gaining momentum. We have made significant progress with the FDA clearance of the full QIAsymphony automation platform and plan for many new test submissions. We're signing new co-development agreements and launching new technologies with Exosome sample kits to gain access to valuable molecular insights in Personalized Healthcare. We're also driving the expansion of QuantiFERON latent TB test in key markets and are now entering China, a very attractive opportunity. And we're developing our capabilities in bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing technologies. Our portfolio of universal solutions is addressing key challenges to adoption of NGS technologies, particularly through products to improve access to challenging biological samples, as well as cutting-edge bioinformatics applications to help customers make sense of the massive amounts of data being generated. In closing, based on the start to the year, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for 2014. And with that, I'd like to hand back to the operator to open up the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division Daniel Wendorff, Commerzbank. Two, if I may, starting off with next-generation sequencing. And there, my question would be how do you see the takeup of your sample preparation solutions in light of the GeneReader not yet being available? I know you mentioned in the presentation that they can basically be used with any sequencer. I'm just curious to know how this would work in terms of marketing. And, yes, how do you see the takeup there? Second question would be, looking at your planned submissions of diagnostic tests in 2014, what would you consider the most important one in terms of the commercial opportunity? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Daniel. Good questions. First on universal next-generation sequencing and the market opportunity, today, if you look at the workflows in next-generation sequencing, they are quite fragmented. So to go from a raw biological sample through to a report, there are actually multiple, multiple different steps today, sometimes anywhere between 10 and 15 hours of hands-on time, a very complex workflow involving many different sub-modules that typically are also supplied by different parties. Very few people actually use larger stretches of solutions provided by any one player. So if you look at sample technology space, which is often mistaken for the sample preparation, sample technologies is the step in which you go from raw biological sample to purified nucleic acid, and there, we have an overwhelming market share. In terms of presence in next-generation sequencing lab, I think we have the highest market share of any company in laboratories in terms of those workflow steps. This is a very critical front-end step that involves very specific protocols, often targeted and optimized and very often validated over years of publications and experience. So the classical sample technology area, where Qiagen has a very, very strong domain strength, is one where we have overwhelming market shares, very often 80%, 90% or in some cases, even more. This is an area where we have an unrivaled leadership as well. And if you go into any laboratory conducting next-gen sequencing, you will typically see our solutions running for that step. The panels that we launched, the first version last year and the second version actually coming this year, have gotten some very good uptake. We've seen the first publications come out showing superior performance of these panels that include the combination of specific gene tests into next-generation sequencing panels in a very, very fast and sleek workflow, dramatically reducing the amount of sample material required for any sequencer and also significantly accelerating the time to panel creation. Our library preparation solutions have some unique workflow advantages. They are easy to automate. And so the so-called sample-to-library workflow is one that is getting very good uptake. The sequencer itself and the -- typically what people call sample preparation is the library preparation step and the sequencing template preparation, these are bundled into sequencers often, but often with inferior solutions. So very few customers, typically, have a homogenous approach there. But it's not really the core target of our focus. We want to go from sample to library, plus then pickup on the data output, which is typically generic, a FASTQ file and go into further processing into VCF and interpretation and then, ultimately, the report. In those areas, we have an extremely sleek and integrated offering, both on the front end and on the downstream. There are several dozens of products we actually are launching in this area or have already today. And as you see from the sales number, it is quite substantial, and people really appreciate the quality and the reputation that we have in these areas. In terms of the second question, the FDA approvals, there's not really 1 single test that I would highlight here. On the QIAsymphony platform, we, in the U.S., see the hospital-acquired infections portfolio as the first one that we will be putting onto the platform and starting to see also the first women's health assays with the Herpes simplex and other assays further down in the pipeline. In Europe, we are you winning across all assay areas. Our blood virals are considered very strong. We are seeing good uptake also in the woman's health in particular, with committee on other assays that we've put onto the platform last year, our Personalized Healthcare assays as well. And now also -- it's too early, really, to say about -- talk about the hospital-acquired infections, but they fit a very unique niche in this area. So I'd say, near term, if you're looking at '14, I would highlight that as a very nice portfolio that has some unique advantages to it. As you saw from the C. diff assay, it actually has a first-to-the-world detection capability in terms of some variants of the bacteria that are quite important to -- for clinical decision-making. So I'd more thinking portfolios than any specific assay in this profiling area. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Following up on GeneReader, Peer. I'm just wondering if you can maybe elaborate on the new timelines. They've slipped a little bit relative to, I think, our prior expectations, for something in the back half of the year. And you did call out some system integration and other issues in the press release. So wondering if you can elaborate on that. And then, secondly, for Roland, the x HPV growth rates were again robust, but I'm just wondering if you can call out the profit contribution from U.S. HPV, both in terms of gross and operating profit just to put it into context on the bottom line. Peer M. Schatz Sure, Tycho. I'll talk the first one; Roland, the second. So first, we all know next-generation sequencing is a pretty dynamically moving area. And in terms of GeneReader, we have refined specifications on the GeneReader system and thereby, adjusted some of our chemistries and other components in our sample-to-insight workflow. This has pushed out timelines, the systems integration and with that, the design lock and therefore, the overall timelines. We are committed to the basic design targets, so the targeted applications in clinical research and diagnostics and the platform technology. So we do expect to provide a good return on this investment. And as with all of our R&D programs, we monitor the value-creation potential on a constant basis. Roland Sackers On the second question, Tycho, as you know, HPV clearly still has a very nice gross margin. Nevertheless, it is also product which, as you recall, has still a quite significant operational expense linked to it. It's the only product within our organization which really has 2 different sales organizations. And therefore, I would say the overall EBIT margin contribution is probably even slightly below our company average these days. And that was something also much kind of quite nicely reflected also in the first quarter results. But despite the quite significant decrease we have seen in our U.S. HPV revenues, we were able to increase our gross margin in the first quarter, especially driven by a very small bioinformatics business, which also comes in with a very nice gross margin improvement in our QuantiFERON operational capabilities. Those are a couple of things which are very helpful. And also, the efficiency programs, which we were able to conclude last year, showing no adverse impact throughout the year, 60 basis points margin improvement. They are coming in from a couple of different factors and helping us, again, even with a quite significant headwind we have in HPV, to improve our margins. That's also something that we believe should be doable but are not [ph]. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division The first question actually just following on, on GeneReader, please. Can you just help us understand a little bit more whether the slight pushback in the timeline was more related to you increasing the functionality of this system or it just relates to some integration hiccups or problems that you haven't anticipated? So just perhaps a little bit more visibility there. And if this project fails in its entirety, can you give us some sense of where you think you can take your next-gen business today and into the future? And perhaps even if you can quantify that, that would be very helpful. And the second question just relates to your refinance. Obviously, some very impressive low interest rates, quite a bit of cash now sitting on the balance sheet for QIAGEN. Are we to assume that any acquisition that you make, be it this year or next year, is likely to be earnings-accretive, given this super low interest rates that you now have? So perhaps, if you can answer those 2, and I have a follow-up. Peer M. Schatz Sure. Scott, I'll take the first question and hand the other -- the second one to Roland. So first, in any development project, you clearly have technical challenges in the systems integration phase. But in this project, it was combined also with our wish to upgrade some of the specifications and make them more amenable to a better profile of the product overall and also better economics. So these 2 things are very difficult to separate out. We are seeing such good success on the universal portfolio currently, such good uptake, that our teams are very focused right now and just making sure we have an almost ubiquitous presence with these universal capabilities before we focus too much on a specific segment of the market. So from that perspective, next-gen sequencing is an important integral part of our vision going forward. The availability of a system is certainly part of the plan going forward, and we're on track to get there. It isn't pushing back our ability to build presence in this market. And probably even more so, as we have now universal approach, that will allow us to address any customer regardless of the platform that they currently have. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. On your second question, the refinancing, the issuance of new convert was really not linked to any potential M&A thoughts we had. I think we had 2 major goals here. And the first goal was, first of all, taking off the potential risk of another 50 million shares dilution with an increasing share price going forward and at the same time, of course, securing a very attractive mid- to long-term debt financing at these very attractive [indiscernible], as I said before. So it was really our 2 focuses [indiscernible] the refinancing. At the same time, we clearly see bolt-on, probably small acquisitions in certain areas as part of our strategy. At the same time, we see that our organic growth rate is clearly accelerating and the 5 growth drivers are moving in the right direction. So I think a combination of those is what we had in mind Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division But it's difficult for you to say whether those bolt-ons will be earnings-accretive at this stage? Roland Sackers It's clearly the goal to make value-enhancing deals. There's no question on that. And I would say, if you look back towards the recent additions and acquisitions we made, they are all quite attractive to Qiagen, and I think we clearly keep it a goal. But again, focus #1 is organic growth. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division Understood. And just last question, please, if I may. Peer, just wondering if you could share some thoughts on primary screening in the U.S. for HPV overseas [ph]. One of your competitors has had some success with that claim [ph]. Just wondering whether you think that heightens the competitive pressures in the U.S. or are you relaxed? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, as you know, we've been in the U.S. HPV market for years. This is a co-testing market where Pap and HPV tests are often done simultaneously, and we see that continuing into the future as well. At the same time, our Qiagen solutions are approved for primary screening in many countries. And that means, in those countries, our Hybrid Capture 2 test is used as the primary test, often in stand-alone settings. The primary screening approach has been used in many markets, like the emerging countries which did not really have a lot of cytology testing in the past. And in those markets and also in first world countries, we have been the leading solutions in these markets. And there, for primary screening what is really interesting is that we have, by far, the most sleek and fast workflow. It is a fast workflow, and we have outperformed the competition significantly in terms of the clinical profile. This is confirmed by the fact that we've been winning almost all primary screening tenders and have not lost any significant tender. Turning back to the U.S., a competitor product recently received FDA approval for primary screening, but we do not really anticipate any real impact. This test has very poor clinical results in several studies where primary screening was used, including 1 in Denmark, where Qiagen showed far better results. FDA approval is -- does really not mean adoption. The guidelines do not support primary screening nor is reimbursement in place. And even if that changes, the system cannot deal with it well. So getting this approach to get some traction will take a lot of time and money and effort. The Pap test has been simply been around forever, and the amount of data needed to convince docs to use this alternative test is extremely high, also considering that there's a significant economic disadvantage to the primary screening method for them. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Roland, I want to ask just a question on margins. I think earlier, in the last quarter, you talked about a little bit of opportunity to consolidate facilities. And I was wondering if you could maybe provide an update on that process. And any sense -- will that actually help gross margins this year? Just wondering what's baked into your expectations in your guidance for gross margin tied to that specific initiative. And then second question will be just on pacing for free cash flow over the balance of the year. Any specific guidance that would cause free cash flow volatility over the balance of the year? Just want to make sure we model that right. Roland Sackers Yes, sure. Let's start with the free cash flow question. We really have seen, in the first quarter, similar numbers than last year, but that still included this $9 million, $10 million payout for restructuring charges incurred in 2014 (sic) [ 2013 ]. This is now fading out, and that's clearly helping us by increasing our cash flow for the year. Nevertheless, I would say that a much more bigger driver over the course of 2014 in helping us to improve our cash flow is operating efficiency. We were able to gain and implement, I would say, over the last 12 to 18 months. So we expect still a quite significant ramp-up in terms of cash flow for the year. And as I said, it's clearly a larger number than we expect from the net income side. The cash conversion rate is going to increase. In terms of overall margin improvement, gross margin, clearly, in the first quarter had trended in the right direction. As I said, bioinformatics and as well [indiscernible] were quite helpful. At the same time, you have to have in mind that the first quarter is typically an instrument quarter where the percentage of revenues coming from the instrumentation business is the lowest one. So obviously, still increasing instrumentation business and moving through the year 2014, it is clearly to [indiscernible] the gross margin expansion. So all in, you probably will see gross margin around what we have seen now in the first quarter. Mid to long term, it's going in the right direction. We have to go through 2014 and eat up the impact on the HPV franchise in the U.S. Once we have included it in our baseline, I think, there's room for more. On the operational efficiency, with R&D, again, the first quarter was slightly above 12% of overall expenses. For the rest of the year, we still believe a number around 12%, somewhere between -- around 12% is probably a fair representation. On the SG&A, you will see also the benefit on the productivity and efficiency gains we were able to make over the course of 2013. So that's 100 basis points margin improvement. [Indiscernible] we were able to close on [ph] a couple of the smaller sized, but mostly, as I said, done already in 2013. So we will see the impact now over the course of 2014 helping us also on the productivity [ph]. Operator Our next question comes from line of Romain Zana of Exane. Romain Zana - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division Two, if I may. The first one regarding the R&D investments. They have increased substantially in Q1. And I can see from the presentation, at the end of the presentation, that the number of employees working in R&D has also risen by 11%. Is that purely related to NGS? And what will be your fair assumption for R&D as a percentage of sales looking forward? And I have another question left. Peer M. Schatz Thanks. Roland, do you want to take that one? Roland Sackers Yes, sure. Actually, it's mainly related to our bioinformatics franchise. So the increase in terms of headcount is coming mainly from those investments we make in bioinformatics. NGS was already in the baseline position, no significant increase so far in 2014. We also expect that in 2014 we feel very well [indiscernible] with the investments we made there. Bioinformatics, right now, of course, is an area which shows as well a significant growth and opportunities and leverages [ph] the recent acquisitions we made. You'll see it also reflected in both R&D spending and as well in headcount. Romain Zana - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division Another question, maybe a bit more technical regarding your 401s [ph] for -- on the EPS guidance. You left the EPS guidance unchanged for 2014 despite the new share buyback program. It is linked to higher-than-anticipated issuance of share in the meantime? Or was the share buyback already assumed in your initial guidance? Roland Sackers No, but a very good question. So we still have to finalize our share buyback program. I think, right now, we still have outstanding around USD 20 million to buy back under the second program. And then we'll probably start, I guess, in the second part of the year, with the third program. Based on limitations we do have in Europe in terms of volume we can buy back on a daily basis, I think it would take some time. So it's quite minimal impact from the share buyback. And then on a 6-month period, we will see how quickly we get it done. It's always a volume number over the course of 2014. Have in mind also, the second and the first one took us a couple of months. So for 2015, a larger impact, not material for 2014. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of ISI Group. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Maybe just -- I had one for Peer. And a lot of moving parts in the Pharma. It was good to see some strength in that segment. Obviously, given some of the consolidation comments that you made, creates a little bit of volatility. But also, I guess, offsetting that, if you look at some of the acceleration on the companion diagnostic side, the strength you're seeing, I think, some of the comments you made on liquid biopsy, it feels like things are actually picking up on the Pharma side. So can you just elaborate on those comments in consolidation? Compare and contrast that versus the companion diagnostic acceleration that you're seeing. Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Vijay. It is definitely quite impressive to see what we have been able to put together in the pipeline. The numbers that we put up out on that 1 slide, we actually put out for the first time. The momentum in this area is very significant. It's a sizable team that we currently have, and they are basically initiating partnerships and managing partnerships across multiple different platforms, primarily PCR and NGS and across multiple indications. Cancer is clearly a big one, but we're also seeing others as well. The pharma consolidations can have a benefit and a disadvantage. So the benefit is if you merge us into parties where you have master collaboration agreements, it's a big benefit. And we've been fortunate partly to see that and therefore, have a promising outlook also on some future pipeline expansions going forward. But on top of that, the fact that we have now multiple products in the market, and as you know from the pipeline, there's some near-term submissions as well over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see more momentum. And these are things that are attracting pharma companies that this is an actually very doable thing for us to do across multiple different testing technologies. And so momentum, as the 1 slide shows, 10% to 15% of the trials included biomarkers 10 years ago, now 45%. And that puts us into a very sweet spot. And we're the only company that has all technologies molecular under 1 roof and also has gone PMA routes and have done so successfully. And that always takes a few years to prove to the market, and we've gone through that phase. And I think those things coming together put us into a good position. I don't expect it to stop. We expect also continued very good inflow of these partnerships. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Just one quick one and then a follow-up. Just, Roland, can you just give us -- can you quantify the HPV hit to the gross margin? Roland Sackers As we said, it's down -- you can do the math. It was down in the U.S. 27% and now it's 9% of total. And gross margin is still in the mid-80s [ph]. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. And I guess on the QIAsymphony and sort of looking at the C. diff approval. So I guess, how does this work? I mean, are -- do you have to go back and retrofit your current industry installed base for the QIAsymphony to get it -- basically, get it up to spec for what the FDA approval was on it? And do you have to do any changes to the installed base to make it compliant? And I guess on the -- when you think about the C. diff test, I mean, where are you expecting to go -- into what types of labs are you expecting to go into? And what are those labs currently testing for and currently using for C. diff? Are they more immunoassay test? Are they more molecular tests? And I'm just curious to think of how you think about taking share and moving to gain share in the C. diff space? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, again, C. diff is a single marker. It's the same path, but if you think of this as a complete portfolio across HAI, it is a pretty powerful proposition. The availability of a broad menu makes it very attractive to laboratories that are providing a wide range of different tests, in particular, in hospitals. The ability to do random-access continuous load testing gives it some very unique features, low cost of capital, very broad menu but still allows quite a sizable throughput of testing at a very attractive cost. So it is a classic medium throughput hospital market testing machine for these hospital-acquired tests. It can also serve as a higher throughput base machine. We've seen also some demand coming in there with some of the more expensive neuro patient tests are simply done a little bit further out towards the patient, but the central laboratory takes a strong role in providing these tests in a centralized format, which is very often in the hospitals and also other types of health care settings, quite an attractive proposition. Some labs are actually doing very high throughput testing even with C. diff. And the systems that are out there or the QIAsymphony RGQ system that we now got FDA clearance for is identical to the systems that we have out there in the market, with the exception that, in some cases, the cycler would need a software upgrade and -- to reflect the newest version of the software that was included in the clearance. So it's quite an easy migration path that can be performed. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division First, on the NGS business. Just digging into that $50 million revenue number that you've mentioned. If you stripped out the plain vanilla extraction, can you speak to the run rate of the NGS prep kit business? Peer M. Schatz The run rate, well, we said $50 million as an overall number at high growth rates, so those are the 2 variables that we put out. I didn't quite understand what you wanted to get in addition to that. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Just the NGS prep kits' targeted -- prep and the things that launched more recently, I'd love to understand kind of the traction there and kind of the growth rates. Peer M. Schatz Okay, sure. So when we talk about sample preparation in NGS, and I'd like to reiterate that and use this opportunity, that very often is mistaken for the sample technologies as we described. And so the preparation from a raw biological sample into purified nucleic acid, what we described sample technologies, is not sample preparation for NGS. What typically is described as sample preparation for NGS are then the steps downstream, so the target enrichment, the library preparation into sequencing. And on that front end, it is very sizable. On the sample technology side, even though it is only 1% to 2% of the biological samples that we process, the majority are other types of downstream analytical techniques, that area is one where you typically have higher-cost product because you're working clinical samples or ones that need very a high-quality front-end sample technology. In terms of the enrichment panels for NGS and also in terms of library preparation, we started ramping up in '13 and are now significantly expanding in this quarter in '14, with the 2.0 [ph] panels that are coming out, and they really have some very, very unique features. This is a very sizable market opportunity, and we're in there right now with a very competitive product. And we think we're step-changing now into something which is probably going to have specification leadership, and that opens up a new market opportunity for us. I would not want to put out any numbers in terms of our expectations other than to say we're seeing very good uptake. First publications are coming out. They are applauding our products in terms of their capabilities, and it is quite a sizable market opportunity for us. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Jon Goldberg of Macquarie. Unknown Analyst This is actually Harris [ph] on for Jon. So I think going to this year, your plan was to offset the expected losses in HPV from contract loss with growth in NGS. And it seems like the HPV losses are happening a little bit quicker than expected while, at the same time, you've delayed the NGS launch. So where are you seeing better performance than you had anticipated at the start of the year? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So what we always said is that, if you look at the prevention portfolio, it currently has 2 elements in it: one is tuberculosis. That is going to surpass $100 million in sales; and U.S. HPV, which is around that number as well. So we're probably going to -- in tuberculosis, we see over 20% growth. And then in HPV, we saw pricing related decline. We're actually quite successfully in maintaining market shares in this market. And so there's 2 products, basically, as we expect flooring of pricing situation in the United States to levels where even market share shifts would not really be too meaningful in terms of their overall impact on us as a company. TB and HPV are the 2 products that are offsetting each other currently. It has nothing to do with NGS. NGS has never been part of our financial plan going forward. We always made it very clear that we're asking that no numbers be included in this and -- as this is still a product in development. John Gilardi I would like to close the conference call here and thank everyone for their participation. If you have any questions or comments, please contact [indiscernible]. Thank you very much.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division Daniel Wendorff, Commerzbank. Two, if I may, starting off with next-generation sequencing. And there, my question would be how do you see the takeup of your sample preparation solutions in light of the GeneReader not yet being available? I know you mentioned in the presentation that they can basically be used with any sequencer. I'm just curious to know how this would work in terms of marketing. And, yes, how do you see the takeup there? Second question would be, looking at your planned submissions of diagnostic tests in 2014, what would you consider the most important one in terms of the commercial opportunity? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Daniel. Good questions. First on universal next-generation sequencing and the market opportunity, today, if you look at the workflows in next-generation sequencing, they are quite fragmented. So to go from a raw biological sample through to a report, there are actually multiple, multiple different steps today, sometimes anywhere between 10 and 15 hours of hands-on time, a very complex workflow involving many different sub-modules that typically are also supplied by different parties. Very few people actually use larger stretches of solutions provided by any one player. So if you look at sample technology space, which is often mistaken for the sample preparation, sample technologies is the step in which you go from raw biological sample to purified nucleic acid, and there, we have an overwhelming market share. In terms of presence in next-generation sequencing lab, I think we have the highest market share of any company in laboratories in terms of those workflow steps. This is a very critical front-end step that involves very specific protocols, often targeted and optimized and very often validated over years of publications and experience. So the classical sample technology area, where Qiagen has a very, very strong domain strength, is one where we have overwhelming market shares, very often 80%, 90% or in some cases, even more. This is an area where we have an unrivaled leadership as well. And if you go into any laboratory conducting next-gen sequencing, you will typically see our solutions running for that step. The panels that we launched, the first version last year and the second version actually coming this year, have gotten some very good uptake. We've seen the first publications come out showing superior performance of these panels that include the combination of specific gene tests into next-generation sequencing panels in a very, very fast and sleek workflow, dramatically reducing the amount of sample material required for any sequencer and also significantly accelerating the time to panel creation. Our library preparation solutions have some unique workflow advantages. They are easy to automate. And so the so-called sample-to-library workflow is one that is getting very good uptake. The sequencer itself and the -- typically what people call sample preparation is the library preparation step and the sequencing template preparation, these are bundled into sequencers often, but often with inferior solutions. So very few customers, typically, have a homogenous approach there. But it's not really the core target of our focus. We want to go from sample to library, plus then pickup on the data output, which is typically generic, a FASTQ file and go into further processing into VCF and interpretation and then, ultimately, the report. In those areas, we have an extremely sleek and integrated offering, both on the front end and on the downstream. There are several dozens of products we actually are launching in this area or have already today. And as you see from the sales number, it is quite substantial, and people really appreciate the quality and the reputation that we have in these areas. In terms of the second question, the FDA approvals, there's not really 1 single test that I would highlight here. On the QIAsymphony platform, we, in the U.S., see the hospital-acquired infections portfolio as the first one that we will be putting onto the platform and starting to see also the first women's health assays with the Herpes simplex and other assays further down in the pipeline. In Europe, we are you winning across all assay areas. Our blood virals are considered very strong. We are seeing good uptake also in the woman's health in particular, with committee on other assays that we've put onto the platform last year, our Personalized Healthcare assays as well. And now also -- it's too early, really, to say about -- talk about the hospital-acquired infections, but they fit a very unique niche in this area. So I'd say, near term, if you're looking at '14, I would highlight that as a very nice portfolio that has some unique advantages to it. As you saw from the C. diff assay, it actually has a first-to-the-world detection capability in terms of some variants of the bacteria that are quite important to -- for clinical decision-making. So I'd more thinking portfolios than any specific assay in this profiling area. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Following up on GeneReader, Peer. I'm just wondering if you can maybe elaborate on the new timelines. They've slipped a little bit relative to, I think, our prior expectations, for something in the back half of the year. And you did call out some system integration and other issues in the press release. So wondering if you can elaborate on that. And then, secondly, for Roland, the x HPV growth rates were again robust, but I'm just wondering if you can call out the profit contribution from U.S. HPV, both in terms of gross and operating profit just to put it into context on the bottom line. Peer M. Schatz Sure, Tycho. I'll talk the first one; Roland, the second. So first, we all know next-generation sequencing is a pretty dynamically moving area. And in terms of GeneReader, we have refined specifications on the GeneReader system and thereby, adjusted some of our chemistries and other components in our sample-to-insight workflow. This has pushed out timelines, the systems integration and with that, the design lock and therefore, the overall timelines. We are committed to the basic design targets, so the targeted applications in clinical research and diagnostics and the platform technology. So we do expect to provide a good return on this investment. And as with all of our R&D programs, we monitor the value-creation potential on a constant basis. Roland Sackers On the second question, Tycho, as you know, HPV clearly still has a very nice gross margin. Nevertheless, it is also product which, as you recall, has still a quite significant operational expense linked to it. It's the only product within our organization which really has 2 different sales organizations. And therefore, I would say the overall EBIT margin contribution is probably even slightly below our company average these days. And that was something also much kind of quite nicely reflected also in the first quarter results. But despite the quite significant decrease we have seen in our U.S. HPV revenues, we were able to increase our gross margin in the first quarter, especially driven by a very small bioinformatics business, which also comes in with a very nice gross margin improvement in our QuantiFERON operational capabilities. Those are a couple of things which are very helpful. And also, the efficiency programs, which we were able to conclude last year, showing no adverse impact throughout the year, 60 basis points margin improvement. They are coming in from a couple of different factors and helping us, again, even with a quite significant headwind we have in HPV, to improve our margins. That's also something that we believe should be doable but are not [ph]. Operator And our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division The first question actually just following on, on GeneReader, please. Can you just help us understand a little bit more whether the slight pushback in the timeline was more related to you increasing the functionality of this system or it just relates to some integration hiccups or problems that you haven't anticipated? So just perhaps a little bit more visibility there. And if this project fails in its entirety, can you give us some sense of where you think you can take your next-gen business today and into the future? And perhaps even if you can quantify that, that would be very helpful. And the second question just relates to your refinance. Obviously, some very impressive low interest rates, quite a bit of cash now sitting on the balance sheet for QIAGEN. Are we to assume that any acquisition that you make, be it this year or next year, is likely to be earnings-accretive, given this super low interest rates that you now have? So perhaps, if you can answer those 2, and I have a follow-up. Peer M. Schatz Sure. Scott, I'll take the first question and hand the other -- the second one to Roland. So first, in any development project, you clearly have technical challenges in the systems integration phase. But in this project, it was combined also with our wish to upgrade some of the specifications and make them more amenable to a better profile of the product overall and also better economics. So these 2 things are very difficult to separate out. We are seeing such good success on the universal portfolio currently, such good uptake, that our teams are very focused right now and just making sure we have an almost ubiquitous presence with these universal capabilities before we focus too much on a specific segment of the market. So from that perspective, next-gen sequencing is an important integral part of our vision going forward. The availability of a system is certainly part of the plan going forward, and we're on track to get there. It isn't pushing back our ability to build presence in this market. And probably even more so, as we have now universal approach, that will allow us to address any customer regardless of the platform that they currently have. Roland? Roland Sackers Yes. On your second question, the refinancing, the issuance of new convert was really not linked to any potential M&A thoughts we had. I think we had 2 major goals here. And the first goal was, first of all, taking off the potential risk of another 50 million shares dilution with an increasing share price going forward and at the same time, of course, securing a very attractive mid- to long-term debt financing at these very attractive [indiscernible], as I said before. So it was really our 2 focuses [indiscernible] the refinancing. At the same time, we clearly see bolt-on, probably small acquisitions in certain areas as part of our strategy. At the same time, we see that our organic growth rate is clearly accelerating and the 5 growth drivers are moving in the right direction. So I think a combination of those is what we had in mind Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division But it's difficult for you to say whether those bolt-ons will be earnings-accretive at this stage? Roland Sackers It's clearly the goal to make value-enhancing deals. There's no question on that. And I would say, if you look back towards the recent additions and acquisitions we made, they are all quite attractive to Qiagen, and I think we clearly keep it a goal. But again, focus #1 is organic growth. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division Understood. And just last question, please, if I may. Peer, just wondering if you could share some thoughts on primary screening in the U.S. for HPV overseas [ph]. One of your competitors has had some success with that claim [ph]. Just wondering whether you think that heightens the competitive pressures in the U.S. or are you relaxed? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, as you know, we've been in the U.S. HPV market for years. This is a co-testing market where Pap and HPV tests are often done simultaneously, and we see that continuing into the future as well. At the same time, our Qiagen solutions are approved for primary screening in many countries. And that means, in those countries, our Hybrid Capture 2 test is used as the primary test, often in stand-alone settings. The primary screening approach has been used in many markets, like the emerging countries which did not really have a lot of cytology testing in the past. And in those markets and also in first world countries, we have been the leading solutions in these markets. And there, for primary screening what is really interesting is that we have, by far, the most sleek and fast workflow. It is a fast workflow, and we have outperformed the competition significantly in terms of the clinical profile. This is confirmed by the fact that we've been winning almost all primary screening tenders and have not lost any significant tender. Turning back to the U.S., a competitor product recently received FDA approval for primary screening, but we do not really anticipate any real impact. This test has very poor clinical results in several studies where primary screening was used, including 1 in Denmark, where Qiagen showed far better results. FDA approval is -- does really not mean adoption. The guidelines do not support primary screening nor is reimbursement in place. And even if that changes, the system cannot deal with it well. So getting this approach to get some traction will take a lot of time and money and effort. The Pap test has been simply been around forever, and the amount of data needed to convince docs to use this alternative test is extremely high, also considering that there's a significant economic disadvantage to the primary screening method for them. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Roland, I want to ask just a question on margins. I think earlier, in the last quarter, you talked about a little bit of opportunity to consolidate facilities. And I was wondering if you could maybe provide an update on that process. And any sense -- will that actually help gross margins this year? Just wondering what's baked into your expectations in your guidance for gross margin tied to that specific initiative. And then second question will be just on pacing for free cash flow over the balance of the year. Any specific guidance that would cause free cash flow volatility over the balance of the year? Just want to make sure we model that right. Roland Sackers Yes, sure. Let's start with the free cash flow question. We really have seen, in the first quarter, similar numbers than last year, but that still included this $9 million, $10 million payout for restructuring charges incurred in 2014 (sic) [ 2013 ]. This is now fading out, and that's clearly helping us by increasing our cash flow for the year. Nevertheless, I would say that a much more bigger driver over the course of 2014 in helping us to improve our cash flow is operating efficiency. We were able to gain and implement, I would say, over the last 12 to 18 months. So we expect still a quite significant ramp-up in terms of cash flow for the year. And as I said, it's clearly a larger number than we expect from the net income side. The cash conversion rate is going to increase. In terms of overall margin improvement, gross margin, clearly, in the first quarter had trended in the right direction. As I said, bioinformatics and as well [indiscernible] were quite helpful. At the same time, you have to have in mind that the first quarter is typically an instrument quarter where the percentage of revenues coming from the instrumentation business is the lowest one. So obviously, still increasing instrumentation business and moving through the year 2014, it is clearly to [indiscernible] the gross margin expansion. So all in, you probably will see gross margin around what we have seen now in the first quarter. Mid to long term, it's going in the right direction. We have to go through 2014 and eat up the impact on the HPV franchise in the U.S. Once we have included it in our baseline, I think, there's room for more. On the operational efficiency, with R&D, again, the first quarter was slightly above 12% of overall expenses. For the rest of the year, we still believe a number around 12%, somewhere between -- around 12% is probably a fair representation. On the SG&A, you will see also the benefit on the productivity and efficiency gains we were able to make over the course of 2013. So that's 100 basis points margin improvement. [Indiscernible] we were able to close on [ph] a couple of the smaller sized, but mostly, as I said, done already in 2013. So we will see the impact now over the course of 2014 helping us also on the productivity [ph]. Operator Our next question comes from line of Romain Zana of Exane. Romain Zana - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division Two, if I may. The first one regarding the R&D investments. They have increased substantially in Q1. And I can see from the presentation, at the end of the presentation, that the number of employees working in R&D has also risen by 11%. Is that purely related to NGS? And what will be your fair assumption for R&D as a percentage of sales looking forward? And I have another question left. Peer M. Schatz Thanks. Roland, do you want to take that one? Roland Sackers Yes, sure. Actually, it's mainly related to our bioinformatics franchise. So the increase in terms of headcount is coming mainly from those investments we make in bioinformatics. NGS was already in the baseline position, no significant increase so far in 2014. We also expect that in 2014 we feel very well [indiscernible] with the investments we made there. Bioinformatics, right now, of course, is an area which shows as well a significant growth and opportunities and leverages [ph] the recent acquisitions we made. You'll see it also reflected in both R&D spending and as well in headcount. Romain Zana - Exane BNP Paribas, Research Division Another question, maybe a bit more technical regarding your 401s [ph] for -- on the EPS guidance. You left the EPS guidance unchanged for 2014 despite the new share buyback program. It is linked to higher-than-anticipated issuance of share in the meantime? Or was the share buyback already assumed in your initial guidance? Roland Sackers No, but a very good question. So we still have to finalize our share buyback program. I think, right now, we still have outstanding around USD 20 million to buy back under the second program. And then we'll probably start, I guess, in the second part of the year, with the third program. Based on limitations we do have in Europe in terms of volume we can buy back on a daily basis, I think it would take some time. So it's quite minimal impact from the share buyback. And then on a 6-month period, we will see how quickly we get it done. It's always a volume number over the course of 2014. Have in mind also, the second and the first one took us a couple of months. So for 2015, a larger impact, not material for 2014. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of ISI Group. Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division Maybe just -- I had one for Peer. And a lot of moving parts in the Pharma. It was good to see some strength in that segment. Obviously, given some of the consolidation comments that you made, creates a little bit of volatility. But also, I guess, offsetting that, if you look at some of the acceleration on the companion diagnostic side, the strength you're seeing, I think, some of the comments you made on liquid biopsy, it feels like things are actually picking up on the Pharma side. So can you just elaborate on those comments in consolidation? Compare and contrast that versus the companion diagnostic acceleration that you're seeing. Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Vijay. It is definitely quite impressive to see what we have been able to put together in the pipeline. The numbers that we put up out on that 1 slide, we actually put out for the first time. The momentum in this area is very significant. It's a sizable team that we currently have, and they are basically initiating partnerships and managing partnerships across multiple different platforms, primarily PCR and NGS and across multiple indications. Cancer is clearly a big one, but we're also seeing others as well. The pharma consolidations can have a benefit and a disadvantage. So the benefit is if you merge us into parties where you have master collaboration agreements, it's a big benefit. And we've been fortunate partly to see that and therefore, have a promising outlook also on some future pipeline expansions going forward. But on top of that, the fact that we have now multiple products in the market, and as you know from the pipeline, there's some near-term submissions as well over the course of the next 12 to 18 months, we're going to see more momentum. And these are things that are attracting pharma companies that this is an actually very doable thing for us to do across multiple different testing technologies. And so momentum, as the 1 slide shows, 10% to 15% of the trials included biomarkers 10 years ago, now 45%. And that puts us into a very sweet spot. And we're the only company that has all technologies molecular under 1 roof and also has gone PMA routes and have done so successfully. And that always takes a few years to prove to the market, and we've gone through that phase. And I think those things coming together put us into a good position. I don't expect it to stop. We expect also continued very good inflow of these partnerships. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Just one quick one and then a follow-up. Just, Roland, can you just give us -- can you quantify the HPV hit to the gross margin? Roland Sackers As we said, it's down -- you can do the math. It was down in the U.S. 27% and now it's 9% of total. And gross margin is still in the mid-80s [ph]. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division Okay. And I guess on the QIAsymphony and sort of looking at the C. diff approval. So I guess, how does this work? I mean, are -- do you have to go back and retrofit your current industry installed base for the QIAsymphony to get it -- basically, get it up to spec for what the FDA approval was on it? And do you have to do any changes to the installed base to make it compliant? And I guess on the -- when you think about the C. diff test, I mean, where are you expecting to go -- into what types of labs are you expecting to go into? And what are those labs currently testing for and currently using for C. diff? Are they more immunoassay test? Are they more molecular tests? And I'm just curious to think of how you think about taking share and moving to gain share in the C. diff space? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, again, C. diff is a single marker. It's the same path, but if you think of this as a complete portfolio across HAI, it is a pretty powerful proposition. The availability of a broad menu makes it very attractive to laboratories that are providing a wide range of different tests, in particular, in hospitals. The ability to do random-access continuous load testing gives it some very unique features, low cost of capital, very broad menu but still allows quite a sizable throughput of testing at a very attractive cost. So it is a classic medium throughput hospital market testing machine for these hospital-acquired tests. It can also serve as a higher throughput base machine. We've seen also some demand coming in there with some of the more expensive neuro patient tests are simply done a little bit further out towards the patient, but the central laboratory takes a strong role in providing these tests in a centralized format, which is very often in the hospitals and also other types of health care settings, quite an attractive proposition. Some labs are actually doing very high throughput testing even with C. diff. And the systems that are out there or the QIAsymphony RGQ system that we now got FDA clearance for is identical to the systems that we have out there in the market, with the exception that, in some cases, the cycler would need a software upgrade and -- to reflect the newest version of the software that was included in the clearance. So it's quite an easy migration path that can be performed. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division First, on the NGS business. Just digging into that $50 million revenue number that you've mentioned. If you stripped out the plain vanilla extraction, can you speak to the run rate of the NGS prep kit business? Peer M. Schatz The run rate, well, we said $50 million as an overall number at high growth rates, so those are the 2 variables that we put out. I didn't quite understand what you wanted to get in addition to that. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division Just the NGS prep kits' targeted -- prep and the things that launched more recently, I'd love to understand kind of the traction there and kind of the growth rates. Peer M. Schatz Okay, sure. So when we talk about sample preparation in NGS, and I'd like to reiterate that and use this opportunity, that very often is mistaken for the sample technologies as we described. And so the preparation from a raw biological sample into purified nucleic acid, what we described sample technologies, is not sample preparation for NGS. What typically is described as sample preparation for NGS are then the steps downstream, so the target enrichment, the library preparation into sequencing. And on that front end, it is very sizable. On the sample technology side, even though it is only 1% to 2% of the biological samples that we process, the majority are other types of downstream analytical techniques, that area is one where you typically have higher-cost product because you're working clinical samples or ones that need very a high-quality front-end sample technology. In terms of the enrichment panels for NGS and also in terms of library preparation, we started ramping up in '13 and are now significantly expanding in this quarter in '14, with the 2.0 [ph] panels that are coming out, and they really have some very, very unique features. This is a very sizable market opportunity, and we're in there right now with a very competitive product. And we think we're step-changing now into something which is probably going to have specification leadership, and that opens up a new market opportunity for us. I would not want to put out any numbers in terms of our expectations other than to say we're seeing very good uptake. First publications are coming out. They are applauding our products in terms of their capabilities, and it is quite a sizable market opportunity for us. Operator And our last question for today comes from the line of Jon Goldberg of Macquarie. Unknown Analyst This is actually Harris [ph] on for Jon. So I think going to this year, your plan was to offset the expected losses in HPV from contract loss with growth in NGS. And it seems like the HPV losses are happening a little bit quicker than expected while, at the same time, you've delayed the NGS launch. So where are you seeing better performance than you had anticipated at the start of the year? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So what we always said is that, if you look at the prevention portfolio, it currently has 2 elements in it: one is tuberculosis. That is going to surpass $100 million in sales; and U.S. HPV, which is around that number as well. So we're probably going to -- in tuberculosis, we see over 20% growth. And then in HPV, we saw pricing related decline. We're actually quite successfully in maintaining market shares in this market. And so there's 2 products, basically, as we expect flooring of pricing situation in the United States to levels where even market share shifts would not really be too meaningful in terms of their overall impact on us as a company. TB and HPV are the 2 products that are offsetting each other currently. It has nothing to do with NGS. NGS has never been part of our financial plan going forward. We always made it very clear that we're asking that no numbers be included in this and -- as this is still a product in development.

Hello, and welcome to our call today, where we will be discussing our results for the second quarter and first half of the year, and update you on the progress we are making to further accelerate innovation and growth. We have 3 messages for you today. First, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for improved sales and earnings based on our achievements in the first half of 2014. As you saw on the press release, adjusted net sales in the second quarter rose 4% at constant exchange rates in line with our communicated targets and were up 5% at actual rates due to some currency benefits. When you exclude the U.S. HPV test portfolio, the rest of the Qiagen portfolio delivered 7% constant exchange rate growth. In terms of earnings, adjusted EPS was $0.26 per share at constant exchange rates, and this was above our target for $0.24 to $0.25 per share at constant exchange rates. And Adjusted EPS was $0.25 at actual rates. For the first half of the year, adjusted net sales were also up 4% constant exchange rate, and this included about 4 percentage points of headwind from lower U.S. HPV test sales. So that means net of the U.S. HPV test portfolio sales, Qiagen grew about 8% on a constant exchange rate basis in the first half of the full year, and this is in line with our communicated full year target for about 8% to 9% constant exchange rate growth. Second message, our 5 growth drivers are gaining momentum and are growing at solid double-digit pace. Among the achievements in the second quarter were 2 PMA approvals from the FDA: one for our therascreen KRAS companion diagnostic kit paired with Vectibix from Amgen; and also our artus CMV kit for the cytomegalovirus assay. These built on the progress in the first quarter with the FDA clearances of the full QIAsymphony RGQ MDx automation platform and the C. difficile assay for detection of the life-threatening infection. Four positive FDA regulatory decisions so far in 2014 is clearly a signal that we are making progress to further build a content menu in the United States and we expect more announcements in the coming months. Other highlights were in Personalized Healthcare with the announcement of a large companion diagnostic project involving liquid biopsies with AstraZeneca in the lung cancer drug, IRESSA. Also of note was our fourth collaboration with Eli Lilly and this one involving biomarker project involving simultaneous DNA and RNA analysis. And in bioinformatics, we have added BIOBASE, the gold standard for hereditary disease analysis to our Ingenuity portfolio. We have also recently launched second generation of gene panels, which are used to enrich genes of interest for sequencing and integrating them with our bioinformatics solutions. Third message, we are committed to disciplined capital allocation through targeted value-creating bolt on acquisitions, as well as through share repurchase programs. The second $100 million share repurchase program was completed in June and we are announcing today the start of the third $100 million program. So in summary, we are pleased with the performance in the first half of the year especially among our 5 growth drivers and have reaffirmed our goals for the full year. I'm now on Slide 5 to provide an overview of the results for our 4 customer classes in the second quarter. Even with the U.S. HPV sales headwinds, Molecular Diagnostics delivered high single-digit growth, and we also saw higher sales in Applied Testing. On the other hand, the Pharma and Academia customer classes faced a slowdown, which was mainly due to a sharp decline in instrument sales, a base effect from last year's sequestration and the restricted funding environment in some countries. In Molecular Diagnostics, the portfolio excluding U.S. HPV sales showed the strongest performance growing 18% on a constant exchange rate basis on the momentum of our 5 growth drivers and providing about 40% of total Qiagen sales. First, we're seeing double-digit sales growth in terms of consumables used on the QIAsymphony system and also for our profiling assays in general that are used for disease detection and monitoring. Our second growth driver is the QuantiFERON latent TB test, and it is delivering growth above our 20% annual target due to ongoing market penetration gains against the 120-year-old skin test. Our Personalized Healthcare portfolio also delivered higher sales in the quarter for both kit sales, as well as revenues from companion diagnostic co-development collaborations. As I mentioned earlier, U.S. sales of HPV testing products were down about 30% in the second quarter and represented about 6% of total sales compared to 10% in the same quarter of 2013. For the first half of the year, these specific product sales were also down about 30%. These rates are in line with our full year expectations as we absorbed the impact of primarily pricing pressure and the transition to a multi-competitor market. As for HPV sales in the rest of the world, they are growing and rose 8% on a constant exchange rate basis in the second quarter and were largely unchanged in the first half compared to the same period in '13, which included large national tender orders. In the Life Sciences, the performance was mixed as Applied Testing showed low single-digit sales growth while Pharma was flat and Academia declined at a single-digit constant exchange rate, and again, weighed on by very weak instrument sales. Bioinformatics contributions were seen in all of these customer classes from Ingenuity, which was acquired in 2013; and CLC bio, which was acquired in August of last year. BIOBASE did not have a meaningful impact yet on overall sales. In Applied Testing, we saw a single-digit growth in both consumables and instruments and in particular, strong demand in forensics, Human ID: products in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region. Pharma experienced a single-digit increase in consumables but saw a double-digit decline in instrument sales against the very strong sales in the same period of 2013. In Academia, we also saw a significant double-digit constant exchange rate decline in instrument sales and that was coupled with the modest decline in consumable sales as well that was felt across the regions. Despite these results for the quarter, we anticipate modestly improving trends in the second half of the year. At the same time, keep in mind that any gains have to be seen in light of the reduced funding levels in 2013 and cautious spending habits. With that, I would like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I'm on Slide 6 and would like to first review in more detail our financial results for the second quarter. Adjusted net sales were at USD 331.2 million in the quarter, rising 5% at actual rate and 4% at constant exchange rates. We saw some currency benefits on sales from the strength of the euro and the British pound against the dollar. Our reported currency, which has more than compensated for headwinds from the yen and other currencies. About 2/3 of the sales growth came from the bioinformatics acquisition, and about 1/3 came from the rest of the portfolio. And as mentioned earlier, the 4% constant exchange rate sales growth included about 3 percentage points of headwind from lower U.S. HPV test sales. Adjusted operating income rose 10% in the quarter, at a much faster pace than sales with adjusted operating income margin, improving to 25% of sales compared to 23% a year ago. It is worth noting that the adjusted gross margin at 72% reflects a shift towards more consumables, which made up 88% of sales in the quarter compared to 87% a year ago. It's a high margin bioinformatics sales helping to offset reduced U.S. HPV sales contributions. In addition to the gross margin gains, operating margin improvements came from sales and marketing, as well as general and administration expenses declining as a percentage of sales in the quarter. And this together more than absorbed higher R&D expenses, which were about 11% of sales. The leverage is coming through from the efficiency project we completed in 2013, in particular projects in accounting, IT and procurement to gain more flexibility and skills for our new shared service center. I also want to note that we had about 40 basis points of currency pressure in the adjusted operating income margin. Moving down from -- moving down the income statement, adjusted net income rose 9% and resulted in an adjusted EPS of $0.26 at constant exchange rate and $0.25 on the actual basis. The adjusted tax rate of 22% was actually a tick above our expectations forward [ph] at 21% tax rate in the quarter. As a reminder, our adjusted EPS guidance for the year is on a constant exchange rate basis given the currency volatility in some of the countries we operate in. I'm now on Slide 7, which shows sales by geographic region and product category for the second quarter. In terms of the regions, the fastest growth came in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region, which provided about 1/3 of sales and grew 7% constant exchange rate. The Nordic region, Turkey and the United Kingdom led the performance and we are seeing some improvement in Southern Europe as well. Molecular Diagnostics sales grew at a double-digit constant exchange rate pace in this region and Applied Testing grew was well, but Pharma and Academia sales were lower. For the first half of the year, this region generated 5% constant exchange rate growth. In the Americas, which provided about 47% of sales and grew 1% constant exchange rate, Brazil NGS delivered growth to help the region overcome lower sales of HPV product in the U.S. When excluding the U.S., HPV test portfolio sales were up 9% constant exchange rate in the region. For the first half of the year, sales in the Americas rose 2% constant exchange rate and were up 12% constant exchange rate excluding U.S. HPV test sales. The Asia Pacific/Japan region experienced a slower period in the second quarter with 3% constant exchange rate sales growth. China and Japan both grew at solid single-digit constant exchange rates but softness in other Asian markets, in particular in the Pharma and Academia customer classes, weighted on the performance. Still, growth in the region for the first half was 7% constant exchange rate. In the top 7 emerging markets, adjusted net sales rose 11% constant exchange rate and provided 14% of sales. We saw improved year-on-year base -- year-on-year sales in Brazil, China, Korea and Turkey against a double-digit decline in Russia. As for the first half of the year, this market has generated 8% constant exchange rate sales growth and provided about 12% of sales. In terms of product sales, consumables and other revenues were up 5% constant exchange rate in the second quarter and provided about 88% of sales. Maintaining the trends seen in the first quarter, this 5% constant exchange rate growth as well and supported by gains in both consumables, as well as the contributions from the bioinformatics acquisition. Instrument sales, however, declined 5% constant exchange rate in the second quarter after year-on-year gains in the first quarter. In the Academia and Pharma customer classes, instrument sales double-digit constant exchange rate reduction in the second quarter sales, which overshadowed low single-digit constant exchange rate growth in Molecular Diagnostics and Applied Testing. For the first half of the year, instrument sales were down 1% constant exchange rate. Moving to Slide 8. Here you have an overview of our financial results for the first half of the year. Adjusted net sales were USD 648.6 million and growth rates were the same as the second quarter, it's 4% constant exchange rate total sales growth and 5% on a reported basis due to some modest currency movement benefits. All customer classes delivered growth for the period and led by Molecular Diagnostics and Applied Testing. Adjusted operating income rose at a faster pace than sales in both the first and second quarters. This adjusted operating income margin improving by about 1 percentage point to 24% of sales from 23% in the first half of 2013. A key driver of margin gains has been the efficiency program completed in 2013 that had a favorable impact on the adjusted gross margin, which improved by 1 point to 72% of sales, as well as on general and administration expenses and sales and marketing since these helped to absorb higher R&D investments. In terms of adjusted net income and EPS, the adjusted tax rate of 22% was actually above our full year target for 20% to 21% tax rate, while adjusted EPS of $0.47 absorbed $0.01 of adverse currency movements. I'm now on Slide 9, which provides an update on our balance sheet and cash flow position after the first half of 2014 and reaffirms our strong financial position. As a first point, we saw a significant improvement in free cash flow, which rose 28% to about USD 77 million in the first half of the year compared to the same period in 2013. The second quarter was especially strong, with about $48 million in this period compared to $30 million a year ago as this is a benefit of our productivity initiatives on operating income. Also supporting the increase was effective working capital management and the number of days sales outstanding, or DSOs, declined to about 67 in the first half of 2014 compared to about 70 in the same period of 2013. The figures for the first half of 2014 also include about USD 10 million of cash restructuring charges related to the completion of our efficiency project in 2013. So we are seeing the anticipated improvements in free cash flow start to materialize. And as a last point, you can see that we continue to have good liquidity and a manageable net debt position with leverage moving slightly higher to 1.2x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This position is enabling us to use our financial resources to support the business expansion, as well as provide increasing returns to shareholders. I would like to now hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes. Thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 10 to provide an update on the progress we are making on initiatives among our 5 growth drivers. Our strategy is anchored on expanding our leadership in Sample & Assay Technologies that address the rapidly evolving needs of customers to transform biological samples into valuable molecular insights. The 5 growth drivers are delivering strong double-digit constant exchange rate sales gains and currently provide more than 1/4 of sales. We expect this share to increase as we reallocate even more resources to further accelerate their momentum. With the QIAsymphony automation platform, we are moving ahead towards our goal of 250 new placements in 2014, building on the more than 1,000 installed systems at the end of 2013. We already have 4 FDA approvals this year: 2 large PMA approvals in May alone; and plan for more in 2014. QuantiFERON is set to break through $100 million of sales in 2014 and has already surpassed the size of a U.S. HPV franchise, providing more than 8% of total sales. Personalized Healthcare is growing on a base of $100 million in annual sales, thanks to higher assay sales and growing revenues from the companion diagnostics co-development agreement. Bioinformatics is an important incremental contributor this year as we create an industry-leading portfolio anchored by the combination of teams and products from Qiagen, Ingenuity, CLC Bio and BIOBASE. And on NGS, we are launching new Sample Technology kits, as well expanding our offering in combination with bioinformatics. Together, we see these activities as having had more than $50 million of annual sales in 2013. Our teams are also moving ahead on development of the GeneReader NGS workflow, and as we announced with the first quarter results, market entry is anticipated in the second half of 2015. I'm now on Slide 11, which provides an overview of some selected new product approvals and launches during the first half of the year. First, we are very pleased with the progress to expand the test menu in the United States through clearance of the full QIAsymphony RGQ MDx system earlier this year and then the clearances of artus C. difficile and cytomegalovirus kits. The C. diff test is a key foundation of our healthcare-acquired infection portfolio, which is planned to also include the artus VanR, QIAsymphony RGQ kit for detection of vancomycin-resistant bacteria and the artus MRSA/SA QS-RGQ kit for detection of methicillin-resistant and susceptible Staphylococcus aureus infections. Customer response to the C. diff test, which is also available in Europe, has been very positive. A key differentiator is the clinical profile of our assay given that it detects both toxin A and B genes, which is important since either toxin can cause this potentially life-threatening infection. The vast majority of the competitive assays only detect one, so they may miss some positives. There is also an economic value proposition given the broad portfolio coming on to QIAsymphony that enables multiple assay consolidation on one platform. The workflow is fast, providing up to 24 test results in a few hours and with capabilities to flex into much higher Sample numbers as well and with very competitive pricing. The approval of our artus CMV assay in May was another key milestone. This was a full PMA, a very onerous clinical trial and a multiyear regulatory process. CMV is a key assay for our QIAsymphony family as it represents a cornerstone in transplantation testing and one that many laboratories also in decentralized settings would very much like to perform. It has many advantages over the older marketed competitor test and then these are leveraged very well with the additional benefits of QIAsymphony in terms of automation, menu and total cost of ownership. We have a number of further new product approvals and launches planned for 2014, and we will keep you updated on our progress. I'm now on Slide 12, where I would like to provide some views on how QuantiFERON-TB is expanding its position as the modern gold standard for latent TB detection. QuantiFERON-TB is increasingly well positioned based on 3 major drivers: cost, accuracy and ease of use. Our assay has significant cost advantages over the competition because it can be easily run in-house and offers economies of scale. And this is why you see competitors having to offer a service business model to compensate for the complexity of their test. In terms of accuracy, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommend choosing the test with the highest specificity, and that would clearly be our test with a 99% level. These are among factors that make QuantiFERON the most widely used modern latent TB test and leading to penetration gains in the U.S. and elsewhere. Among developments in the quarter, there was an interesting study published in the Open Forum of Infectious Diseases in late June that discussed the estimated prevalence of TB infection based on the activities of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, which has been using our test since 2006. With about 70,000 tests in this study, this is the largest study to date involving a growth [ph] test. The results showed that the patient characteristics associated with positive test results were consistent with known TB risk factors. The authors also said the results showed IGRA test, here meaning QuantiFERON-TB, since it was used in the study are reliable for TB infection -- detection. Beyond New York City, all of the other leading Big City TB programs, including San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles use QuantiFERON as their standard test. Also of note was an announcement in early June by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, or USPSTF, which is responsible for primary healthcare screening guidelines in the United States. They released a draft research plan on screening for latent TB infection and invited public comments through early July. The resulting evidence report will take some time to be created and will form the basis for any new USPSTF recommendations. We see this as a very positive step towards greater awareness about the public health threats of TB and how QuantiFERON-TB can play a role in detection. I'm now on Slide 13 for a quick update on our Personalized Healthcare portfolio and in particular, 3 recent developments. First, we announced in May a fourth collaboration with Eli Lilly to codevelop assay panels that can simultaneously detect DNA and RNA biomarkers targeting multiple cellular pathways involved in common types of cancer and associated with various development projects at Lilly, with whom we have a master collaboration agreement. Certain applications in biomarker development for tailoring oncology therapeutic require a combined simultaneous analysis of DNA and RNA, and this collaboration uses a multi-model, multi-analyte solution that can process multiple Sample types and biomarkers in a single test. Some of the assays will be based on the Modaplex platform, which has an FDA 510(k) clearance and became part of Qiagen through the acquisition of the PrimeraDX, a Boston-based company. The acquisition price was very low and related to the Lilly collaboration. In the meantime, we're seeing very strong demand from other Pharma partners for similar agreements, in particular since Modaplex enables so-called multi-modal rapid and cost-efficient DNA and RNA analysis that is not possible with other technologies, including next-generation sequencing. Our top priority is to address the needs of our Pharma partners and also those of pathologists as well. And we are not wed to any one type of technology platform to get the job done for our customers and patients. Second, AstraZeneca and QIAGEN just announced the other day a new collaboration to develop a blood-based diagnostic test to identify patients who are suitable for treatment with IRESSA, AstraZeneca's therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. We already provide the FDA-approved therascreen EGFR test that is based on a tumor sample from a surgical procedure, and this test is used in Europe and elsewhere in combination with IRESSA. Liquid biopsies will provide now a noninvasive way to gain molecular insights into a patient's EGFR and mutation status, especially if there is no chance for an operation. We have a strong leadership position in the liquid biopsy area, with success defined by the combination of a clinically proven assay with technologies for sample collection and processing, an era of unrivaled leadership for QIAGEN. Third, as you also saw during the quarter, we also gained FDA regulatory approval for our therascreen KRAS test in combination with Vectibix from Amgen, and this approval is tied to the label change for this medicine for first-line use in patients with wild-type KRAS metastatic colorectal cancer. This marks our third FDA approval for a companion diagnostic. And as the last point, we have been expanding our portfolio of biomarkers, building up our intellectual property rights, in particular, 4 new biomarkers in the area of blood cancers. These include the calreticulin, or CALR, and SF3B1 and they are included in the GeneRead DNAseq Leukemia V2 gene panels for next-generation sequencing. Moving to Slide 14, this gives you an overview of our expanding next-generation sequencing portfolio, particularly in terms of universal solutions that can be used with any biological sample, any sequencer and with any sequence data. As our teams develop GeneReader, we are pushing the expansion and commercialization of our next-generation sequencing product used to prepare sample for sequencing and then bioinformatics for analysis and interpretation. In terms of Sample Technologies, in which we help our customers to collect, process and extract nucleic acids from biological samples, we have already launched 10 new kits this year, including 4 in the second quarter alone. We are seeing strong customer demand for the REPLI-g kits that are quickly becoming the technology of choice for single-cell processing for next-generation sequencing analysis. And we are also seeing growing interest across our liquid biopsy area, such as cell free DNA and Exosome processing. In terms of exosomes, we just launched a first kit that is designed to enrich these tiny vesicles found in blood samples and then to extract the nucleic acids that they contain. Our teams are also developing and expanding the range of bioinformatics solutions offered by QIAGEN. We announced during the quarter the integration of some content from BIOBASE, a privately held German company that we acquired into Ingenuity Variant Analysis. The addition of this expert-curated content from BIOBASE is an exciting expansion of our offering. One of the BIOBASE databases is HGMD, the Human Gene Mutation Database, which is the gold standard for comprehensive data on human-inherited deceased mutations. PGMD, or the PharmacoGenomic Mutation Database, is another database that enables the identification of all published gene variants that have been shown to affect drug response in patients. These solutions are also being integrated into Ingenuity Clinical, our forthcoming web-based solution designed to deliver faster, easier-to-use and high-confidence clinical interpretation and reporting of insights from sequencing-based tests. We will have more to share later this year on Ingenuity Clinical and our commercialization plans. Moving to Slide 15, I'd like to highlight the new GeneRead DNAseq V2 cancer gene panels that we recently launched for use with any sequencer. We have launched 14 new gene panels that encompass 570 clinically relevant cancer genes. They are customizable to include other genes or gene regions of clinical or biological interest and are compatible with any sequencer. There are 3 categories of panels: focused panels with 8 to 25 genes; disease-specific panels for 40 to 50 genes; and comprehensive panels containing up to 160 genes. These new panels lead in terms of portfolio breadth and specifications. These benefits were made possible by the very deep molecular content in our GeneGlobe assay biosciences portfolio, as well as our assay development expertise, including the development of regulated diagnostic assays. In addition, we're leveraging our bioinformatics franchises by integrating them with these panels, thereby adding significant value for users seeking fast and high-quality interpretation. One misconception that we hear from some in the financial community is that gene panels are all essentially the same, and that is clearly not the case. We actually see this step, the sampling, extracting and enriching of genes of interest, as one of the most critical steps in targeted sequencing. As you see on the bottom of this slide, the QIAGEN GeneRead version 2 panels offer a very competitive profile on many metrics. For example, customers can work with as little as 10 nanograms of DNA input with our panels while turnaround time is also very efficient and the panels are offered at a very competitive price. With that, I would like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. I'm now on Slide 16 to review our guidance for the third quarter of 2014 and also to reaffirm the various points of our full year guidance. For the full year, we continue to expect total sales growth of about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate. This includes a headwind of up to about 4 percentage points from declining U.S. HPV test sales and for the rest of the business to grow about 8% to 9% constant exchange rate. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow faster than sales and generate at least 100 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement. We also continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $1.07 to $1.09 at constant exchange rates for full year 2014 compared to $1.02 in 2013. These expectations do not take into account any further acquisitions that could be done in 2014. We have given these targets for adjusted EPS at constant exchange rates since we continue to expect a modestly positive currency benefit on sales but an adverse currency impact on earnings. For the third quarter of 2014, adjusted net sales are expected to again rise about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate and we expect about $0.26 to $0.27 of adjusted EPS, also at constant exchange rate. This slide also contains assumptions for adjusted -- adjustments to results for the first quarter and the full year. For the full year 2014, we continue to expect about $120 million for amortization of acquired intellectual property and about $10 million to $15 million for business integration and acquisition items and an adjusted tax rate of about 20% to 21%, and this is expected to be at the higher end of this range. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 17 for a quick summary before I move into Q&A. We're moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth during 2014 while also increasing returns to shareholders. Let me review what we have announced. First, we achieved our targets for the second quarter and based on the performance for the first half of the full year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for higher adjusted net sales and earnings. Second, our 5 growth drivers are gaining momentum. We have made significant progress with 4 positive FDA regulatory decisions so far this year and are seeking to deliver 250 new system placements. We are signing new co-development agreements in Personalized Healthcare and these include, for the first time, the use of liquid biopsies also in formalized large programs to gain access to valuable molecular insights, as well as analyzing DNA and RNA simultaneously from Sample. We're also driving the expansion of the QuantiFERON latent TB test towards $100 million of sales this year, and we are developing our capabilities in bioinformatics, a next-generation sequencing technologies, and in particular, through the addition of BIOBASE, the leader in hereditary disease analysis to our portfolio, as well as through the launch of highly competitive gene panels for use on any sequencer. Third, we are committed to disciplined capital allocation through targeted acquisitions, as well as by increasing returns to shareholders through share repurchase programs, and today, we are launching our third $100 million program. In closing, we are well positioned to achieve our goals for 2014. And with that, I'd like to hand back to the operator to open up for the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank, 2 if I may. One broader question also with regards to your guidance and the weakness you saw in -- or you saw with academic-research customers as well as with Pharma customers in the second quarter. Is that something we are going to see in the second half as well? And if you see an improvement there, what would that mean in terms of potential full year performance for these 2 customer classes? And second question would be on the QuantiFERON-TB test. I mean, it sounds all great and -- what you're telling us and the best test for different reasons, limited competition in huge market. And what would you expect -- potentially wrong way of asking it, where do you see in this test in 3 to 4 years' time in terms of sales? I mean, the overall market potential in theory might be $1 billion. Of course, there might be additional competition. There is one additional test. But where do you see the really truly addressable markets? And what area we would find this test in 3 to 4 years' time? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Daniel. I'll address the second question first and then the first one afterwards. So you address the potential market for QuantiFERON-TB Gold, 50 million skin tests performed approximately a year in the western -- or ex-China world and this would calculate to about the numbers you described before. And we're moving very rapidly in penetrating into that market. Our primary competition is the skin test where we have enormous advantages but also against the older competing test that is quite cumbersome to use and currently only available as a service in the United States. We are definitely outperforming and have been seeing some very good success and also gaining share even against that. But our primary competition is clearly the skin test. And this is a very core theme of all of our growth drivers. We see these as having very long trajectories of growth opportunity, and in this case, we see no end to this very good, very strong double-digit, high double-digit growth rate. And as we note, there's also portfolio expansion that we're working on. So there are a number of additional products coming out that we're very much looking forward to report on around the QuantiFERON franchise to further create new opportunities. So I think the easiest probably now is just to assume that we are expecting a similar, very strong trajectory for many years to come. In terms of the second quarter performance in Academia and Pharma, Academia was definitely disappointing, the performance there. It is about 1/5 of our sales base but still clearly very important to us. We had a base effect from 2013 sequestration kicked in over the course of the second quarter into the third quarter last year. So we're -- we have a strong base effect that is factoring into the growth rates. At the same time, we're seeing more positive funding environment in the U.S. in addition to the base effect possibly kicking in, in the second half of the year. In addition, we're obviously focusing more on this market, in particular, in instrumentation where we were focusing on some strategically important product areas and are now expanding the focus also across the full instrumentation line. The majority of the impact, as you see, was in instrumentation, and we would expect Academia to, on an annual basis -- multiyear basis, to be on that trajectory in the low- to mid-single-digit numbers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Peer, could you give us an update on your ability to convert -- now that you have additional FDA approvals, your ability to convert the lab-developed test market to your FDA-approved products? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, the C. diff was approved as -- in the first quarter and now CMV in the second quarter. We have a number of other assays coming forward. We talked about in the HAI area but also other areas that we see as cornerstone to creating more placements for QIAsymphony RGQ in the U.S., and thereby seeing this conversion happen. The important thing is to have a cornerstone menu of critical assays that are of certain significance, clinical significance or of a certain throughput to create a cost of ownership proposition for the QIAsymphony RGQ and then selectively convert the LDTs to these assays or even further support the LDTs but now for use on QIAsymphony. If we take the European market as an example, the -- we should never forget, 60% of the diagnostic market is ex-U.S. and the example here for Europe is that we have over 20 assays, approved assays, cleared assays in Europe, CE-marked assays, and they are typically very selectively used to create a cost of ownership proposition to customers. They buy, let's say, on blood virals, some will be HIV/hepatitis accounts, others would be HAI accounts, others women's health accounts. And then we start expanding the menu off that initial proposition. So having several of these footholds is important for us. We have HAI and transplantation now coming forward. These are probably 2 of the most interesting products to disseminate. And so we will then look at selectively converting LDTs or even porting them over to QIAsymphony because the system is clearly also equipped to run both approved and LDT assays. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Two just quick ones here. I just want to make sure I understand your comments on Pharma and Academic, Peer. You're certainly a little bit more subdued than your peers, and obviously, you have the tough instrument comp for Pharma. So can you maybe just talk about the order trends exiting the quarter? And are you in fact expecting a recovery in both of those segments in the back half of the year? And then secondly, on the liquid biopsy platform, can you maybe just talk about the pipeline of interest beyond the AstraZeneca deal and how you think about commercializing that more broadly? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Tycho. I think the first question, there are 2 answers to that. First is there's a base effect that will kick in on the second half of the year, primarily in Academia. So we continue to see a soft trend in the first half. And many peers have also seen something similar. So Life Sciences is very often reported as a group at many peer companies. But if you go into the Academic piece, I think the market was continued to be soft in the second quarter, at least in terms of growth rate because of the sequestration base effect that we had. So that base effect should then annualize in the second half of the year, thereby driving up the growth rates up as -- due to that annualized base effect. And on top of that, the funding -- our committed funding for 2014 was actually quite favorable and we haven't seen a lot of that come in yet. And that we hope on top of that base effect could provide further growth stimulus. In Pharma, it's a little bit more choppy. It's a smaller piece of our revenue base, and individual programs can move up or down. So I wouldn't factor too much into that performance in the second quarter. So we had quarters with high single-digit growth rates and now low single-digit or flat sometimes. It typically averages out to the mid-single-digit numbers. It can jump around a little bit based on larger programs. And the second question was the... Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division On liquid biopsy. Peer M. Schatz Liquid biopsy, extremely important area for us, Tycho. The liquid biopsy's success is defined by the quality of a sample processing, and this is an area of unrivaled leadership for us. We clearly have extremely strong capabilities in franchises and also leadership positions in how samples can be collected, how samples should be stabilized, processed, enriched, isolated, purified, stored. And that's where the success of liquid biopsies are typically created. Isolating that extremely rare target nucleic acid from highly complex biological specimen is extremely important for us. So we have a broad array of products already out there on the market, and are, by far, the leader. Be it in prenatal testing, be it in cancer testing, our products are the standard solution of choice. The -- in the cancer area and the link to companion diagnostics, we are creating additional utility because we can think about much easier screening programs to identify candidates for certain drugs without having to need assays or access to tissue samples. And we can also create monitoring tools to monitor the success of the drug and also potential recurrence. So we're creating a complete continuum, a cancer-care continuum versus just a stratification. And the assay might be a real-time PCR, it might be a next-gen sequencing assay, it might be a small panel, but the sample processing will typically define the success of the downstream analytical result. And we're trying to create from many programs that we currently have with Pharma, not only a stratification companion diagnostic, but also the flanking products as well, and this is getting a lot of traction. So many of the programs now see this as an integral part of the clinical roadmap for the drug or the companion diagnostic. That, by the way, leads to much higher assay sales, obviously. Instead of just doing a onetime stratification to stratify patients into a drug, we can create recurrence monitoring, almost like PCR-able where -- and certain intervals, retesting would occur. This is obviously also in our commercial interest for the assay sales. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Peer, can you comment a little bit as to whether or not you feel bioinformatics has what it needs at this point? Or are there other opportunities for acquisitions? And then what does the pipeline look like for nonbioinformatics deals? You guys have had success, obviously, with Cellestis and then also, to some extent, with Amnisure and deals like that. But is there an opportunity to go back into some more kind of product-type of acquisitions going forward? Peer M. Schatz Absolutely. So bioinformatics remains an area of key focus for us. We have a very strong lead in this space, and we are very successful in our formed teams and organization structures that are integrating these capabilities that we have into a very strong and grace of unit. We actually have created a known business area within our organization, lifting this to a direct report to me, and we're spending a lot of time and focus on this area. We see this as an area of growth that is attractive for us. It is value-creating for us and we see this as a long-term competitive advantage that we're creating in select areas of bioinformatics. So the growth trajectory, we expect will continue for quite some time both organic and also strategic. In terms of the deals that we see at the moment, yes, we are -- we're clearly looking out there. It is a very -- the market has clearly moved in other directions than it was, let's say, 5 years ago. But if we look back at the transactions we did over the last 5 years, they were with hindsight now incredibly successful. And we -- starting with Ipsogen, we're the absolute leader in hemato-oncology testing and both in next-gen sequencing now and also in real-time PCR. With the acquisition of Cellestis, we have created tremendous value. This is a great growth driver for many years for us now. With the bioinformatics franchises, this is now quickly becoming the leading or it is already today, the leading unit for next-generation sequencing bioinformatics with extremely strong leadership positions. And what we're looking for and continue to look for and we're extremely selective in this area, are franchises that can deliver many, many years of growth trajectory. So we're not simply looking at filling holes right now. We have enough on our plate but we're trying to identify areas that are synergistic and have long trajectories of growth that can contribute to our company. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division Peer, I have 3. Yes, just picking up on your comments that you made about you realizing something like $50 million worth of revenues in next-generation sequencing in 2013, I just wonder if you can give a little bit more clarity there. Were you also sort of referring to the $25 million or so of bioinformatics revenues that you acquired actually throughout the course of the year, so that your underlying was around $25 million consumables? Just wondering if you can then elaborate upon that a little bit. Obviously, we see some quite interesting technologies coming through from your V2 gene panels. Can you give us a sense of how you see that unfolding in the sense of revenue potential for those consumables over the next year or 2? Just to give us a feeling for your non- -- if you like, your Platform-Agnostic-related business with consumables in next gen. That's question #1 then please. The second question, obviously, very pleasing to see strong progress with QuantiFERON as expected, certainly by your initial guidance. Can you share some thoughts as to why you're comfortable that the competitive environment for this technology is stronger than perhaps the HPV testing modality? I guess, obviously, group exposure to this one single test is becoming more and more. So I just want to get a sense over stability of that franchise. That's it and I have one follow-up. Peer M. Schatz Sure. Okay, so the first question was on the next-gen portfolio. There, I'd like to maybe clarify that not all of the bioinformatics revenues that came in through acquisition are actually next-gen sequencing related. So Ingenuity also had a very sizable franchise that works with gene expression data from arrays of real-time PCR. So the percentage of consumables and assays in that $50 million number is actually much higher. The CLC bio franchise was predominantly a next-generation sequencing related, but that was substantially smaller. The growth trajectory there, we expect to continue to be extremely strong because we really just started. And the portfolio started developing -- over the course of 2011 and '12, we started a lot of the developments. Consumables have shorter development cycles. We started launching in '13, and now very significantly in '14. And the portfolio is getting a lot of traction. So the capabilities that we have upfront in sample processing, enriching of genes, content-specific enrichments, I would say, are almost second to none here in this space. And we have, in the meantime, a very sizable revenue base that we expect we'll be able to continue for a very long time. Your second question was related to QuantiFERON. Every product has a life cycle, but this product is very early in the life cycle. The product has a very long trajectory of growth in front of it because the development of an assay like this is extremely tricky, and it needs access to a number of different technologies that are quite visible in the market. And so if something would occur in terms of new development, it would be a multiyear development process. The validation of a technology like this is extremely challenging. Also, this is a very large clinical trial that would be required to validate this technology because you're actually detecting something that is very difficult to detect with other technologies. In particular, skin tests, there's a lot of holes in terms of its performance. So our capabilities there are -- to see into the future are very strong. And that said, we're also developing -- and we'll talk about that very soon, we're developing a lot around that portfolio. The current product is extremely strong and beats anything hands down, actually, in terms of performance validated by many, many peer-reviewed journals. But we're also on top of that continuing development. So there is one older product out there that was -- that's a little bit older than ours and represents maybe a first-generation product that, however, is extremely cumbersome to use and has significant workflow disadvantages. So our product is really tailored here to extremely slick and easy processing. And it almost can't get easier. And that is something that is giving us a significant competitive advantage over the competition. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division So I think I have just, I guess, 3 cleanup questions. The first is, weather negatively impacted you in the first quarter. I was just wondering if there was some recapture of those lost revenue in the second quarter. The second question is, Japan revenue dropped a bit sequentially, which is, of course, a typical seasonal phenomenon but it grew very nicely year-over-year although that was in part to the base effect. So cutting through that and keeping in mind the tax changes, it does seem like the second quarter was probably better than expected. I'm just wondering if you would agree with that. And then the third question is just whether or not you would be willing to provide a status update on the commercial rollout of QuantiFERON in China, as well as your efforts to recapture latent TB share in Japan. Peer M. Schatz Okay. So I'll take the second 2 and Roland, if you could take the first one. So in terms of Japan, the team did a very good job in Japan in the second quarter. As you correctly point out, there were some significant tax changes that led to quite some volatility around the first and second quarter change, including also the fiscal year impact. So good performance. Everybody's a little bit cautious right now to see what is going to happen with Japan in the second half of the year. And the team is going to continue to execute very well like they did in the second quarter. I'm confident of that. The -- it's a little bit early to make a prediction. Does it have a meaningful impact on our overall members. No, not really. It's a sizable piece of our revenue base, but Japan is not a fast-growing country and, therefore, will not have a meaningful impact in particular in terms of its Academia portion. The rollout of QuantiFERON in China is going very well. We're seeing great uptake. We're seeing a lot of new publications come out, many exclusively calling out our product now. And the uptake is fully in line with our expectations that were very strong uptake and expansion of the market. As we all know, it's a huge opportunity in terms of numbers. The pricing in certain segments even is very attractive, and we're going after those first. In terms of Japan, yes, we've been able to roll that back. And as many of you know, we had some delivery problems in Japan last year due to some import challenges that were related to quality cut offs. That was alleviated now and we are seeing a very good rollback of the market. It is just very, very difficult to run high numbers of tests on any alternative products, be it skin test or competing products. And so that has given us a good catch back of the -- recapturing of the market share. Roland Sackers And in terms of question #1, I'm not sure if I understood correctly, otherwise, please correct me. But I would say weather didn't have too much of an impact. I would say, generally, we are quite pleased with the performance in the second quarter. I would say, the single biggest negative surprise for us actually in the second quarter was the performance of Russia, which clearly was something what came in negatively for us. But all in, we made our guidance in terms of sales growth. We actually were better than expected in terms of profitability, again, a 10% rise in profitability with the 5% sales growth is something we were quite pleased with. And we do believe that we have a good basis here to move into the second part of the year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division Question, Roland, for you on the numbers here, just on your guidance. Organic growth, looks like it should improve a little bit in the back half of the year. So I'm curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about the range of what you think is reasonable for incremental margins, just what's implied in the guidance that you have given the portfolio evolution that you've made and the -- in the restructuring that you've done in the company. Roland Sackers Yes. Thanks for the question. First of all, I think the second quarter clearly shows the direction, which we can go a good margin improvement and our overall guidance still remains at least 100 basis points for the year. And that is also what we believe we can do midterm. So it's clearly something what we believe is also achievable on a period longer than just 12 months. Same is true for cash flow. You have seen a very nice pick up in the first 6 months in terms of cash flow. We do believe that's going to continue, not only in the second part of the year, but also going forward. So clearly, profitability is in a much faster growth rate right now. John Gilardi So thank you, Roland with that answer. With that, I'd like to close the call, and thank you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to call us, and thank you for your time today. Roland Sackers Thanks. Bye-bye.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division Daniel Wendorff from Commerzbank, 2 if I may. One broader question also with regards to your guidance and the weakness you saw in -- or you saw with academic-research customers as well as with Pharma customers in the second quarter. Is that something we are going to see in the second half as well? And if you see an improvement there, what would that mean in terms of potential full year performance for these 2 customer classes? And second question would be on the QuantiFERON-TB test. I mean, it sounds all great and -- what you're telling us and the best test for different reasons, limited competition in huge market. And what would you expect -- potentially wrong way of asking it, where do you see in this test in 3 to 4 years' time in terms of sales? I mean, the overall market potential in theory might be $1 billion. Of course, there might be additional competition. There is one additional test. But where do you see the really truly addressable markets? And what area we would find this test in 3 to 4 years' time? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Daniel. I'll address the second question first and then the first one afterwards. So you address the potential market for QuantiFERON-TB Gold, 50 million skin tests performed approximately a year in the western -- or ex-China world and this would calculate to about the numbers you described before. And we're moving very rapidly in penetrating into that market. Our primary competition is the skin test where we have enormous advantages but also against the older competing test that is quite cumbersome to use and currently only available as a service in the United States. We are definitely outperforming and have been seeing some very good success and also gaining share even against that. But our primary competition is clearly the skin test. And this is a very core theme of all of our growth drivers. We see these as having very long trajectories of growth opportunity, and in this case, we see no end to this very good, very strong double-digit, high double-digit growth rate. And as we note, there's also portfolio expansion that we're working on. So there are a number of additional products coming out that we're very much looking forward to report on around the QuantiFERON franchise to further create new opportunities. So I think the easiest probably now is just to assume that we are expecting a similar, very strong trajectory for many years to come. In terms of the second quarter performance in Academia and Pharma, Academia was definitely disappointing, the performance there. It is about 1/5 of our sales base but still clearly very important to us. We had a base effect from 2013 sequestration kicked in over the course of the second quarter into the third quarter last year. So we're -- we have a strong base effect that is factoring into the growth rates. At the same time, we're seeing more positive funding environment in the U.S. in addition to the base effect possibly kicking in, in the second half of the year. In addition, we're obviously focusing more on this market, in particular, in instrumentation where we were focusing on some strategically important product areas and are now expanding the focus also across the full instrumentation line. The majority of the impact, as you see, was in instrumentation, and we would expect Academia to, on an annual basis -- multiyear basis, to be on that trajectory in the low- to mid-single-digit numbers. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Peer, could you give us an update on your ability to convert -- now that you have additional FDA approvals, your ability to convert the lab-developed test market to your FDA-approved products? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, the C. diff was approved as -- in the first quarter and now CMV in the second quarter. We have a number of other assays coming forward. We talked about in the HAI area but also other areas that we see as cornerstone to creating more placements for QIAsymphony RGQ in the U.S., and thereby seeing this conversion happen. The important thing is to have a cornerstone menu of critical assays that are of certain significance, clinical significance or of a certain throughput to create a cost of ownership proposition for the QIAsymphony RGQ and then selectively convert the LDTs to these assays or even further support the LDTs but now for use on QIAsymphony. If we take the European market as an example, the -- we should never forget, 60% of the diagnostic market is ex-U.S. and the example here for Europe is that we have over 20 assays, approved assays, cleared assays in Europe, CE-marked assays, and they are typically very selectively used to create a cost of ownership proposition to customers. They buy, let's say, on blood virals, some will be HIV/hepatitis accounts, others would be HAI accounts, others women's health accounts. And then we start expanding the menu off that initial proposition. So having several of these footholds is important for us. We have HAI and transplantation now coming forward. These are probably 2 of the most interesting products to disseminate. And so we will then look at selectively converting LDTs or even porting them over to QIAsymphony because the system is clearly also equipped to run both approved and LDT assays. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Two just quick ones here. I just want to make sure I understand your comments on Pharma and Academic, Peer. You're certainly a little bit more subdued than your peers, and obviously, you have the tough instrument comp for Pharma. So can you maybe just talk about the order trends exiting the quarter? And are you in fact expecting a recovery in both of those segments in the back half of the year? And then secondly, on the liquid biopsy platform, can you maybe just talk about the pipeline of interest beyond the AstraZeneca deal and how you think about commercializing that more broadly? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Tycho. I think the first question, there are 2 answers to that. First is there's a base effect that will kick in on the second half of the year, primarily in Academia. So we continue to see a soft trend in the first half. And many peers have also seen something similar. So Life Sciences is very often reported as a group at many peer companies. But if you go into the Academic piece, I think the market was continued to be soft in the second quarter, at least in terms of growth rate because of the sequestration base effect that we had. So that base effect should then annualize in the second half of the year, thereby driving up the growth rates up as -- due to that annualized base effect. And on top of that, the funding -- our committed funding for 2014 was actually quite favorable and we haven't seen a lot of that come in yet. And that we hope on top of that base effect could provide further growth stimulus. In Pharma, it's a little bit more choppy. It's a smaller piece of our revenue base, and individual programs can move up or down. So I wouldn't factor too much into that performance in the second quarter. So we had quarters with high single-digit growth rates and now low single-digit or flat sometimes. It typically averages out to the mid-single-digit numbers. It can jump around a little bit based on larger programs. And the second question was the... Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division On liquid biopsy. Peer M. Schatz Liquid biopsy, extremely important area for us, Tycho. The liquid biopsy's success is defined by the quality of a sample processing, and this is an area of unrivaled leadership for us. We clearly have extremely strong capabilities in franchises and also leadership positions in how samples can be collected, how samples should be stabilized, processed, enriched, isolated, purified, stored. And that's where the success of liquid biopsies are typically created. Isolating that extremely rare target nucleic acid from highly complex biological specimen is extremely important for us. So we have a broad array of products already out there on the market, and are, by far, the leader. Be it in prenatal testing, be it in cancer testing, our products are the standard solution of choice. The -- in the cancer area and the link to companion diagnostics, we are creating additional utility because we can think about much easier screening programs to identify candidates for certain drugs without having to need assays or access to tissue samples. And we can also create monitoring tools to monitor the success of the drug and also potential recurrence. So we're creating a complete continuum, a cancer-care continuum versus just a stratification. And the assay might be a real-time PCR, it might be a next-gen sequencing assay, it might be a small panel, but the sample processing will typically define the success of the downstream analytical result. And we're trying to create from many programs that we currently have with Pharma, not only a stratification companion diagnostic, but also the flanking products as well, and this is getting a lot of traction. So many of the programs now see this as an integral part of the clinical roadmap for the drug or the companion diagnostic. That, by the way, leads to much higher assay sales, obviously. Instead of just doing a onetime stratification to stratify patients into a drug, we can create recurrence monitoring, almost like PCR-able where -- and certain intervals, retesting would occur. This is obviously also in our commercial interest for the assay sales. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Peer, can you comment a little bit as to whether or not you feel bioinformatics has what it needs at this point? Or are there other opportunities for acquisitions? And then what does the pipeline look like for nonbioinformatics deals? You guys have had success, obviously, with Cellestis and then also, to some extent, with Amnisure and deals like that. But is there an opportunity to go back into some more kind of product-type of acquisitions going forward? Peer M. Schatz Absolutely. So bioinformatics remains an area of key focus for us. We have a very strong lead in this space, and we are very successful in our formed teams and organization structures that are integrating these capabilities that we have into a very strong and grace of unit. We actually have created a known business area within our organization, lifting this to a direct report to me, and we're spending a lot of time and focus on this area. We see this as an area of growth that is attractive for us. It is value-creating for us and we see this as a long-term competitive advantage that we're creating in select areas of bioinformatics. So the growth trajectory, we expect will continue for quite some time both organic and also strategic. In terms of the deals that we see at the moment, yes, we are -- we're clearly looking out there. It is a very -- the market has clearly moved in other directions than it was, let's say, 5 years ago. But if we look back at the transactions we did over the last 5 years, they were with hindsight now incredibly successful. And we -- starting with Ipsogen, we're the absolute leader in hemato-oncology testing and both in next-gen sequencing now and also in real-time PCR. With the acquisition of Cellestis, we have created tremendous value. This is a great growth driver for many years for us now. With the bioinformatics franchises, this is now quickly becoming the leading or it is already today, the leading unit for next-generation sequencing bioinformatics with extremely strong leadership positions. And what we're looking for and continue to look for and we're extremely selective in this area, are franchises that can deliver many, many years of growth trajectory. So we're not simply looking at filling holes right now. We have enough on our plate but we're trying to identify areas that are synergistic and have long trajectories of growth that can contribute to our company. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division Peer, I have 3. Yes, just picking up on your comments that you made about you realizing something like $50 million worth of revenues in next-generation sequencing in 2013, I just wonder if you can give a little bit more clarity there. Were you also sort of referring to the $25 million or so of bioinformatics revenues that you acquired actually throughout the course of the year, so that your underlying was around $25 million consumables? Just wondering if you can then elaborate upon that a little bit. Obviously, we see some quite interesting technologies coming through from your V2 gene panels. Can you give us a sense of how you see that unfolding in the sense of revenue potential for those consumables over the next year or 2? Just to give us a feeling for your non- -- if you like, your Platform-Agnostic-related business with consumables in next gen. That's question #1 then please. The second question, obviously, very pleasing to see strong progress with QuantiFERON as expected, certainly by your initial guidance. Can you share some thoughts as to why you're comfortable that the competitive environment for this technology is stronger than perhaps the HPV testing modality? I guess, obviously, group exposure to this one single test is becoming more and more. So I just want to get a sense over stability of that franchise. That's it and I have one follow-up. Peer M. Schatz Sure. Okay, so the first question was on the next-gen portfolio. There, I'd like to maybe clarify that not all of the bioinformatics revenues that came in through acquisition are actually next-gen sequencing related. So Ingenuity also had a very sizable franchise that works with gene expression data from arrays of real-time PCR. So the percentage of consumables and assays in that $50 million number is actually much higher. The CLC bio franchise was predominantly a next-generation sequencing related, but that was substantially smaller. The growth trajectory there, we expect to continue to be extremely strong because we really just started. And the portfolio started developing -- over the course of 2011 and '12, we started a lot of the developments. Consumables have shorter development cycles. We started launching in '13, and now very significantly in '14. And the portfolio is getting a lot of traction. So the capabilities that we have upfront in sample processing, enriching of genes, content-specific enrichments, I would say, are almost second to none here in this space. And we have, in the meantime, a very sizable revenue base that we expect we'll be able to continue for a very long time. Your second question was related to QuantiFERON. Every product has a life cycle, but this product is very early in the life cycle. The product has a very long trajectory of growth in front of it because the development of an assay like this is extremely tricky, and it needs access to a number of different technologies that are quite visible in the market. And so if something would occur in terms of new development, it would be a multiyear development process. The validation of a technology like this is extremely challenging. Also, this is a very large clinical trial that would be required to validate this technology because you're actually detecting something that is very difficult to detect with other technologies. In particular, skin tests, there's a lot of holes in terms of its performance. So our capabilities there are -- to see into the future are very strong. And that said, we're also developing -- and we'll talk about that very soon, we're developing a lot around that portfolio. The current product is extremely strong and beats anything hands down, actually, in terms of performance validated by many, many peer-reviewed journals. But we're also on top of that continuing development. So there is one older product out there that was -- that's a little bit older than ours and represents maybe a first-generation product that, however, is extremely cumbersome to use and has significant workflow disadvantages. So our product is really tailored here to extremely slick and easy processing. And it almost can't get easier. And that is something that is giving us a significant competitive advantage over the competition. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.

Welcome and thank you for joining QIAGENs Conference Call to discuss results for the Q3 of 2014. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Please be advised that this call is being recorded at QIAGENs request and will be made available on their Internet site. The presentation will be followed by a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to introduce your host, John Gilardi, Vice President of Corporate Communications at QIAGEN. Please go ahead. John Gilardi Hello and welcome to our conference call tonight. Our speakers today are Peer Schatz, the CEO of QIAGEN; and Roland Sackers, our CFO. Before we begin, Id like to thank all of you for participating today at this unusual time for QIAGEN results call. The reason for the change was our supervisory board meeting this week at our Silicon Valley site. We will return to our traditional schedule with the fourth quarter results in January. On Slide 2, youll see the customary disclaimer. The discussions and responses to your questions on this call reflect managements views as of today, October 29, 2014. We will be making statements and providing responses to your questions that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future. And these constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor provisions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Thank you, John. Hello and welcome to our call today to discuss results for the third quarter and also for first nine months of the year. Our teams at QIAGEN are moving ahead to accelerate the pace of innovation and growth and we have three messages for you today. First, we achieved our target for the third quarter. As you saw in the press release, adjusted net sales rose 4% at constant exchange rates in the third quarter and this was in line with our communicated target for about 4% to 5% growth. These results include the expected decline in sales of our U.S. HPV test portfolio, which created about 5 percentage points of headwind in the third quarter. In other words, our growth excluding the HPV headwinds in the U.S. was 10% at constant exchange rates. In terms of earnings, the adjusted operating income margin remained at 25% while adjusted EPS was $0.27 per share and at the high-end of the guidance set for $0.26 to $0.27 per share. We also had strong free cash flow of $72 million in the quarter. Second, we are moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth, especially among our growth drivers that are creating a foundation for sustainable and long-term expansion. These products together are growing at a solid double-digit pace, now providing about 30% of our total sales. There were many recent achievements, but Id like to quickly highlight the advances in Personalized Healthcare. First, you saw the news this week about our eighth master collaboration agreement and this was with Astellas Pharma of Japan. The Astellas collaboration involves a range of drug candidates in several therapeutic areas. Furthermore, this is another partner gaining access to our development capabilities and full workflows for both tissue and liquid biopsy processing and involving PCR, NGS and multimodal testing technologies. In terms of liquid biopsies, this is a very dynamic area and we are active in this field across numerous collaborations and have already standardized key areas of this emerging field with the automated solutions for liquid biopsy processing. As discussed in our last call, the real challenge in liquid biopsies is not in the detection or sequencing, it is a sample handling and that is where QIAGEN fells. Also in Personalized Healthcare, we recently completed the PMA or pre-marketing approval submission to the FDA for a companion diagnostic paired with a novel medicine. We are prevented by an agreement with our partner to say anything more about this project, but this is another milestone for us in terms of showing we can work effectively with Pharma partners and deliver an extensive U.S. submissions. This also comes after the four positive FDA decision so far this year including our KRAS test paired with the colorectal cancer drug Vectibix from Amgen. Third, we are reaffirming our full-year goals for higher sales and earnings. For adjusted net sales, we have tightened the original range to 4% growth at constant exchange rates and also tightened the range for adjusted EPS to $1.08 per share also constant exchange rates. So in summary, we are pleased with the performance so far this year and were committed to achieving our full-year goals while preparing for further innovation and growth for 2015. Im now on Slide 5, I wanted to share some perspectives on the sales development in 2014. As you know, we are working through the pressure on pricing in our U.S. HPV franchise. Looking at the graph on the right side, the 35% decline in U.S. HPV in the first nine months of 2014 was in line with our full-year expectations for about 4 percentage points at top line headwind. At the same time, we delivered a solid 9% growth at constant exchange rates from the rest of the portfolio in the first nine months of the year and this is also in line with our full-year goals. We will provide our formal guidance for 2015 in January, but as for some initial views, we have been saying publicly to expect U.S. HPV headwinds to continue to at least part of 2015. Based on the current situation, this could be up to about 3 percentage points pressure on total sales for the full-year. Some of you may be asking about the source of the renewed pressure, especially given that this product represented about 7% of total sales for QIAGEN in the first nine months of 2014. The reason is that we are securing longer term market share while renewing customer contracts in light of the challenging pricing environment, which was driven by our competition. While we can often achieve a premium price based on proven clinical superiority of test general pricing levels have continued to drop substantially. So this is expected to have an impact, in particular in the first half of 2015, but then we moved with this issue once and for all and as any change in pricing and volume from that level would not have a material impact on our overall financial results. Our U.S. HPV sales are expected to fall below 5% of our total sales in 2015. At the same time, the rest of the QIAGEN portfolio continues to grow at a solid pace and the 6% organic pace excluding the U.S. HPV sales so far in 2014 provides a provisional baseline to consider going into 2015. Once we get through this, the broader and more resilient QIAGEN portfolio, which spans some of the most exciting areas of molecular diagnostics and life sciences, is set to have a strong impact on the overall revenue base and become even stronger in 2015. Im now on Slide 6 to provide an overview of results from our four customer classes. Our Molecular Diagnostics customer class is leading the performance, growing 6% at constant exchange rates in the third quarter and at a faster 19% rate when excluding the U.S. HPV franchise and this was on a base of about 46% of our total sales. When you analyze these sales you have a run rate of about $550 million at this very high growth rate. The gains in Molecular Diagnostics are coming from across our portfolio of growth drivers. We are seeing strong double-digit consumables growth on the QIAsymphony system also for our overall portfolio of profiling assays that are used for disease detection and monitoring. The QuantiFERON latent TB test continues to deliver growth at its 20% annual target. Our personalized healthcare portfolio has also been growing at a solid double-digit rate, and I want to note here that we saw significantly higher revenues in the third quarter of 2014 from companion diagnostic co-development collaborations along with gains and kit sales. As mentioned previously, many of our collaborations are not announced, but even among those that we can make public 2014 has been a very good year for QIAGEN in terms of expanding our portfolio of partnerships and assay development programs and milestones. The improvements were further supported by our decision to build an industry leader in bioinformatics through the combination of Ingenuity CLC and BIOBASE with our own activities and these sales contributions were across all customer classes. In the life sciences, we saw improving trends against the third quarter of 2013 and also against the second quarter of this year. In Applied Testing, we saw a return to high single-digit growth in both consumables and instruments and in particular strong demand for forensics and human identification products, following the launch of some new investigator assays. In the pharma customer class, we saw higher instrument sales in the third quarter along with the similar single-digit sales increase at constant exchange rates from consumables and bioinformatics. And in Academia, weve been seeing signs of improving customer sentiment including in the United States, but here we also saw a rather modest decline in instrument sales for the third quarter along with largely flat consumable sales. The sentiment is improving, but keep in mind that funding levels are still far below level seen a few years ago and also that we have seen a shift in mentality, a much more cautious and prudent approach to spending that has taken hold in the U.S. and Europe. With that I would like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good evening to everyone in Europe and good afternoon for those joining from the U.S. Im now on Slide 7 and would like to review our results in more detail. In terms of adjusted net sales, we delivered 4% growth at constant and actual exchange rates for both the third quarter and for the nine months period. And this is only a small currency impact; however, we expect this currency trend to become negative in the fourth quarter and I will touch on that later with our guidance. For third quarter about one percentage point of total sales growth came from the CLC and BIOBASE bioinformatics acquisitions while about 3 percentage points came from the rest of the business including ingenuity. And for the first nine months, the 4% constant exchange rate goal has been balanced between contributions from the bioinformatic acquisitions and the rest of the portfolio. Adjusted operating income rose 7% in the third quarter at a faster pace than sales and resulting in the 50 basis points increase in the adjusted income margin compared to a year ago. In terms of margin gains, we were able to maintain the adjusted gross margin at 72% and also absorbed higher R&D investments which were about 12% of sales in the 2014 quarter compared to about 11% a year ago. Sale and marketing expenses also declined slightly compared to a year ago, while margin benefits also came from efficiency improvement in general and administration. For the first nine months of the year, we saw a similar trend in terms of adjusted operating income, generating an 8% improvement over the same period in 2013. The adjusted operating income margin showed about 80 basis points of improvement in the 2014 period and that is after observing about 20 basis points of foreign currency pressure. So we are moving ahead towards our 2014 goal of at least 100 basis points of improvement from the 24.4% margin in 2013 under the new adjustment policy. Moving down the income statement, adjusted income in the third quarter was up 6% with adjusted EPS of $0.27 at constant exchange rate and on an actual basis. For the first nine months of 2014, adjusted net income improved at an even faster 8% rate with adjusted EPS of $0.75 at both constant and actual exchange rates and a steady 21% tax rate compared to the same period in 2013. Im now on Slide 8 to review our adjusted sales in the third quarter by region and product category. In terms of the region, the fastest growth came in the Europe, Middle East, Africa region, which delivered 30% growth at constant exchange rates in a broader stratosphere. The Nordic region and Turkey led the performance and we are seeing some improvement in Southern Europe as well. This regional performance was included to revenues from a global customer agreement. Molecular Diagnostics sales grew at a double-digit pace in this region, but Pharma and Academia sales were slightly lower. The Americas declined slightly in the quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013 and this was due to the U.S. HPV headwinds with this region growing 9% at constant rate, excluding that impact. We also saw an adverse impact on results in Mexico and Brazil from the timing of national tenders. After relatively slow period in the second quarter, the Asia-Pacific / Japan region experienced a faster growth in the third quarter, delivering a 6% improvement at constant exchange rate. We saw a good overall double-digit constant exchange rate improvement in China, driven mainly by performance in Molecular Diagnostics. Japan also grew at a good pace in the quarter and we were pleased with double-digit gains in Korea. In terms of top seven emerging markets, results in the third quarter were disappointing and below the traditional double-digit constant exchange rate basis and thus delivering a 1% sales decline at constant exchange rates and providing about 40% of total sales. On the positive side, we saw solid double-digit incremental work in Turkey, Korea and China along with growth in India, but this was offset by Russia as well as due to the timing impact of national orders in Mexico and Brazil. In terms of product sales, consumables and other revenues, which includes bioinformatics sales, grew towards 3% at constant exchange rate in the third quarter and provided about 87% of sales maintaining at 20% so far this year of single-digit growth in this category. Instrument sales advanced at strongest quarter periods in more than two years, delivering 11% growth at constant exchange rates and providing about 13% of total sales and this was supported by increased instrument service revenues. Reagent rental agreements are on the rise who ongoing QIAsymphony system placements, especially in molecular diagnostics as we are moving toward our year-end 2014 goal of 1,215 total system placement. Moving to Slide 9, you have an update on our balance sheet and cash flow position after the first nine months of the quarter. On the right side of the slide, you will see the improving trend in free cash flow during 2014, which was 18% to US$72 million in the third quarter of 2014 compared to the same  we had cash restructuring charges of about $65 million during 2013 and about $10 million of cash restructuring charges in this year, but beyond that we are generating significant improvement from efficiency programs. We continue to have good liquidity and a manageable net debt position. This leverage remaining at about 1.1 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. This enables us to support the third US$100 million dollar share repurchase program underway as well as maintain strategic flexibility. I would like now to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you Roland and now on Slide 10 to the review of a few of our growth drivers that continue to deliver a strong double-digit gain and now represent about 30% of total sales and we expect this increase to about 40% in 2015. On the QIAsymphony automation platform, we are moving ahead to deliver 250 new placements in 2014, which would put us at about 250 cumulative placements at the end of the year making one of the most widely placed systems its not the most widely placed system for medium throughput molecular processing. A key driver is the expanding menu of the addition of seven tests so far in 2014 in the United States and Europe on the Rotor-Gene Q thats PCR component of the workflow with growth of about 20% at constant exchange rate and on track to achieve $100 million in 2014. QuantiFERON has already surpassed the size of our U.S. HPV franchise and is now slated to top our global HPV franchise. We expect 20 constant exchange rate  growth rate into 2015 and beyond based on the strong demand for this product as a new goal standard for latent TB. The total addressable market for QuantiFERON is actually expanding. We have told you before about the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force guideline, review that in underway in the United States and that will take a few years to be completed. We also mentioned that clinical data has been showing the need for testing a people with type 2 diabetes, both would have a big impact on the total addressable market for latent TB testing. And in particular for QuantiFERON-TB Gold since it was the key test to demonstrate this. The biggest impact and  what is new just as of Tuesday is the announcement this week by the WHO of comprehensive new guidelines for prevention care and TB control that now includes screening and treatment for latent TB infection to avert progression to active disease. We applaud this decision which will affect more than 100 low and intermediate incidence countries and these include Brazil, Mexico and China. As for the expansion of the total addressable market, we believe QuantiFERON is well positioned to take a leading role in this new strategy especially as were nearing commercialization of the fourth generation of this test. Im now on Slide 11, I want to give an update on our sample technology portfolio for use in liquid biopsies which is a new noninvasive technology that as an example is being used for detection of disease biomarkers and cancer. I hope you understand the theory the focus is on target classes derived from blood plasma serum, cerebrospinal fluid, urine or other liquid samples. These targets are free circulating DNA being released from tumor cells, the circulating cells being shed from the tumors itself or the exosomes containing RNA that are being secretive from tumor cells. This bar chart shows the explosion in publications on this topic. Liquid biopsies were a hot topic at the recent ESMO Conference in Madrid with a number of posters and peer review papers showing very positive results from using liquid biopsies to capture molecular insights that will help to treatments for cancer patients. These can be in patients with diseases such as lung cancer where getting tissue tumor material can be challenging or and monitoring of patient after surgery to remove the tumor. We have been expanding our industry leading portfolio, sample technologies during 2014 in particular during the third quarter with the launch of the new exoRNeasy kits to isolate exosomal RNA from Serum/Plasma even from a sample of small as one milliliter. Customers are using our portfolio to generating fascinating insights. As one example, the pediatric hematology and oncology department at the Hanover Medical Center has been using these technologies and QIAGENs REPLI-g Single Cell Kits which make single cells accessible to next generation sequencing analysis to perform comparative studies of leukemia stem cells and controlled stem cells. These new sample technologies will be coming in essential part of our pharma collaborations as you may have seen, AstraZeneca received a positive European regulatory opinion in September from the [cGMP] (ph) to include blood-based diagnostic testing for patients who could benefit from treatment with the lung cancer drug, IRESSA, but are unable to provide a suitable tumor sample. We applause this development with our partner and look forward to advance in the use of these innovative blood-based tests to drive better treatment outcomes for patients. I am now on Slide 12, I want to share some views on the progress being made in our offering of next-generation sequencing universal solutions and bioinformatics. A recent milestone was the integration of the 14 GeneRead DNAseq V2 gene panels, which form a wide range of cancer and translational research applications with our Ingenuity Variant Analysis bioinformatics solution. This is a tangible milestone in achieving our ambition to offer universal products that address key bottlenecks, holding back the adoption of next-generation sequencing translational research and clinical diagnostics, as well as complete solutions such as the GeneReader workflow that is in development and on track for commercialization in the second half of 2015. In this case, the bottlenecks to NGS are the need for reliable and proven gene panel. Studies are showing considerable variability among the different competitor offerings and the need to link assays to the highest quality data analysis and interpretation. This slide shows you our comprehensive offerings to generate insights for different customer needs, ranging from basic discovery research with RNA and DNA, through to translational medicine requirements and then onto routine clinical diagnostics. As we announced at the recent ASHG Conference, adoption of our universal bioinformatics solution is growing rapidly, as we continue to integrate and expand the capabilities and knowledge bases of CLC bio, Ingenuity and BIOBASE and bringing that together with the lab workflow solutions of QIAGEN. And that is reflected and recently achieving a milestone of more than 250,000 human genomic samples having been used with QIAGENs bioinformatics interpretation solutions. Next generation sequencing is not about generating gigabytes of data from the most technically advanced machine, so its about offering customers a range of solutions that provides a means to transform biological samples into valuable molecular insights. And it is about those insights having an impact on treatment decisions or advancing our knowledge of a disease. This is the motivation of our teams to move ahead and take advantage of our competitive strengths in the terms of sample technologies, leading clinical assay development capabilities, experience and automation solutions and leadership and bioinformatics. Moving to Slide 13, I want to share with you some perspectives on our efforts to support public health agencies in the fight against the Ebola. Here we are building on our proven capabilities as a leading provider of diagnostic and surveillance solutions in previous health emergencies, in particular the H5N1 and H1N1 influenza outbreaks, as well as the SARS and MERS respiratory syndrome outbreak. Our teams are working closely with international organizations and research institutions in Africa and elsewhere around the world to provide testing components and automation solutions for Ebola virus detection. As one example, QIAGEN products are part of the protocol of the U.S. Department of Defense, in particular the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit that can be automated on the QIAcube and this is the most widely used protocol for Ebola detection in Western Africa. The screen shot from CNN in October shows the role of our product. In this case, the Walter Reed Army Institute in Bethesda, Maryland and a particular QIAcube and assorted QIAGEN kits in the background. The WHO is using the QIAamp Viral RNA Kit in 15 African countries for Ebola testing. The Ebola test used by the DoD received FDA emergency use approval in August. In addition, the DoD also relies on the QIAGEN EZ1 instrument and the EZ1 Virus Mini Kit for testing of non-U.S. citizens. The DoD has shipped these products to Liberia for Ebola testing and we are seeing demand from agencies in other countries that are sending teams to Africa. Were working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on how QIAGEN can further support their efforts as well and they have an Emergency Use Authorization in place using the RNeasy sample technology kit. We also recently signed an agreement for commercialization of complete test kits with our Hamburg-based partner, altona Diagnostics. The test is already CE-marked and will be made available as part of a full QIAGEN solution through our commercial networks very shortly. This will enable QIAGEN to offer a full solution from biological sample-to-insight. We will provide updates on regulatory milestones when they are achieved. Beyond these commercial activities, QIAGEN is supporting numerous activities to study the Ebola virus, including a project initiative by the Broad Institute and Harvard University in collaboration with the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone through donations and assistance to set up local testing infrastructures. Of course, no one wants this deadly outbreak to become more severe. The business impact to-date has been modest and has not had an influence on our 2014 guidance. Given the unpredictable nature of the Ebola situation it would be inappropriate to speculate on potential revenue implications should be outbreak expand. Moving to Slide 14, today were announcing the appointments of two internationally experienced industry executives to our executive committee. First, Dr. Laura Furmanski joined QIAGEN this summer in a newly created role as Senior Vice President of our Bioinformatics Business Area. She is leading our rapidly growing presence in this area and is based at our QIAGEN Silicon Valley office. Laura joined from McKinsey & Company where she was a partner in the Silicon Valley office and worked with many med-tech and life science companies on a range of engagements. Manuel O. Mendez was appointed as Senior Vice President of Global Commercial Operations in October. He is a 25 year veteran of life sciences and diagnostics industry. Having most recently served as Americas Executive Vice President at bioMeriux, prior to that he held leadership positions with OraSure, Thermo Fisher and Abbott diagnostics business. He has had a truly global career with assignment so far in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Korea, and Japan. Manuel succeeds Benedikt von Braunmhl who chose to lead QIAGEN for personal reasons. I would like to thank Benedikt for his outstanding contributions in Latin America and Europe and also globally and at most recent role and wish him all the best for his future endeavors. These employments show the ability of QIAGEN to attract top talent and further strengthen our international leadership team. And with that I would like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Im now on Slide 15 to review our guidance. For the full year we have tightened our adjusted net sales target to 4% at constant exchange rates, and this is in lined with our original 2014 guidance for about 4% to 5% constant exchange rate growth. To the space and about 8% constant exchange rate growth from the portfolio excluding the U.S. HPV test with headwinds of about 4 percentage points from the U.S. HPV sales. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow faster than sales and generate at least 100 basis points of margin improvement. We also tighten the range on adjusted diluted EPS through $1.08 per share at constant exchange rates, which is a mid-point of the 2014 full year range. These expectations do not take into account any further acquisition this year. Like in January we announced adjusted EPS guidance at constant exchange rates in anticipation that sometime these would move against the dollar during the year. Based on recent trends especially since September the dollar has strengthened against the euro and some other currencies especially in countries where they have rise in sales across our limited costs. So we now expect modestly negative currency impact on full year sales of up to about 50 to 100 basis points and currency related pressure on adjusted EPS that could potentially be up to $0.01 per share. For the fourth quarter adjusted net sales are expected to rise about 4% at constant exchange rates and adjusted EPS of $0.33 all to that constant exchange rates. This slide also contains adjustment assumptions. For the full year we continue to expect about $120 million for amortization of acquired intellectual property and about $15 million for business integration and acquisition items. We also tied into guidance adjusted tax rate to 20% while the number of shares outstanding remains at about 242 million. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. Im now on Slide 16 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. Were pleased with our performance during the first nine months of 2014 moving ahead on the initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth while working through headwinds created by the U.S HPV franchise. Let me review what weve announced. First, we achieved our targets for the third quarter with higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share as well as a solid increase in free cash flow. Second, we are moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth, especially among our growth drivers that are expanding at a solid double-digit pace and currently provide about 30% of total sales moving towards 40% in 2015. They form a foundation for sustainable growth in the coming years, especially as we work through the final year of U.S. HPV headwinds in 2015. Third, we are re-affirming our full-year 2014 guidance for adjusted net sales and earnings growth over 2013. We are committed to achieving our full-year goals and preparing our team for further innovation and growth in 2015. With that, Id like to hand back to the operator to open up the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) One moment please for the first question. First question is from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good afternoon. Peer M. Schatz Hi, Derik. How are you? Derik de Bruin  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Youve made some really good progress in the off margin this year, 100 basis points of expansion and I guess how should we think about that for 2015, particularly since the currencies I know will potentially give you some benefit. And I guess just also from modeling purposes, how are you sort of thinking about the effects on the top line for next year? Peer M. Schatz Roland, you want to take that? Roland Sackers Yes, sure. Hi, Derik. Generally we still see that as a positive (indiscernible) we will create a few over the last 12 months to 18 months. And so, we want to believe that were able to continue that positive trend also into the quarter for 2015. Clearly its also to a certain extend depending to the revenue guidance which we are giving only next year. Nevertheless, if you look on the different drivers for that, a couple of them are doing quite well. If you look on our [shared] (ph) service centers all the things we were able to do in administration, integration and globalization of all procurement efforts. So we feel comfortable at least on the bill funds. And again you see it also now, finally, really pushing its too on the cash flow side, those things coming together quite nicely. Operator Next question is Daniel Wendorff with Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff  Commerzbank AG Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. And its actually relating the HPV franchise and Peer you mentioned that number of contracts were prolonged in the U.S. and this with broaden the first half 2015. So my question on that is and how long do these contracts normally last? If I cut it right for the past, these were around two year contract, is that still valid? Peer M. Schatz Hello, Daniel. So its a well, were signing every year hundreds of agreements that are coming up for renewal and they can extend anywhere between even out to one year Id say the majority are some in the range of three years. And the important thing for us clearly this year is the competition has reached at the pricing levels. That were actually able to secure very large portion of them, even now despite that the pricing is lower it gives us very strong market share and position also within these accounts for several years to come from which we can expand with other offerings. So its typically in the range of a few years, the average duration assumed is around three years. Operator The next question is from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks. I guess question on Bioinformatics, you announced where weve seen your higher, you announced the Genomics England project and youve kind of integrated Ingenuity with the Cancer Research what mentioned. So can you maybe just talk about a) the patient of Genomics England when that flows through the other still gaps you need to fill on the informatics side. And then see, just any feedback on Ingenuity with the Cancer Research Workbench solutions. Peer M. Schatz Sure. So in terms of the portfolio to started out with that we have an incredibly strong position in secondary analysis, which we are expanding through offerings the retailer to specific type of users be the cancer researchers or others. So just for those you have never seen these types, the analysis, the secondary analysis of next-generation sequencing data is incredibly complex with many, many different ways to ultimately get to your at the definitional of what is a variant. And were expanding and tailoring that to the different needs were already today have by far the largest offering in this base. And so that position is one that were building from a real position strength and that will continue and very similar in the interpretation area where our knowledge bases are  were actually accelerating the efforts in this area to further broaden their capabilities and this is going at a very rapid pace. What you saw for instance at ASHG is that were now starting to integrate them and not only the Ingenuity Variant Analysis or the Ingenuity Clinical systems with secondary analysis from CLC bio, but now also the HCMD franchises from BIOBASE and the problem in bioinformatics today is that there are many, many different tools but there are many small individual tools that are not aggregated. Were creating something very seamless for our customers targeted towards their applications. The response of the market is actually very, very positive. So the seamlessness takes a lot complexity in interface management out of the system, which software is just deadly and systems continue to be upgraded and enhanced over time to ensure certain seamlessness is extremely valuable for our customers. Insurance is now large contracts. We are very successful as obviously the key go to resource for interpretation secondary analysis that we have a strong  very strong and competitive position to offer. We have mentioned the 250,000 genomes that were for instance processed already or our genomic samples that were processed. This compares to a few 100 or few 1000 that you see even in very large institutions. So this number 250,000 is a one that it is just miles ahead of anything else that is out there. And I think this puts us into a very strong position for large scale genomic analysis studies that for instance youve referred to before. Operator Your next question is from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Lawson  Mizuho Securities Yes, just on the HPV business. Where are you seeing the most pressures that from large competitors or small private companies? And then when do you think that business stabilizes? Peer M. Schatz Its very different in terms of the geography. So the HPV franchise ex-U.S. is actually doing quite well. Were very successful. Were winning almost every major tender where were moving ahead quite rapidly and develop, but also in less developed countries. In the United States  and there typically in ex-U.S., we see competition many, many players, small players, but we are  by far the majority share player there. Situation in the U.S. is very different that we clearly have a oligopoly or few players basically in this market. And what happened was that due to very poor uptick of competing tests, the pricing button was pushed and the pricing levels collapsed. And while we are still able to command a premium in many cases, it is quite clear that if customers have price of x, it is tough to charge to 2x. So, weve been forced to go along with those pricing levels. Competition is in the States across the three other players basically that are on the market, really only two at the moment. Operator The next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is [Ryan Decker] (ph) filling-in for Doug. Couple on QuantiFERON. How was the launch in China tracking relative to your expectations firstly? Number two, can you talk a little bit about QuantiFERON in Japan and how successful youve been in winning back those accounts that you lost previously? And lastly, can you provide any additional color on commercialization timelines for TB Plus? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz Sure. So the first question, QuantiFERON, China is moving ahead well. As you know, we were the key partner in all of the major studies that provide credits in groundbreaking, also clinical evidence for the Chinese market. Our product was a test of choice and therefore validated the benefits of our products quite impressively for the Chinese market. So, this is moving ahead quite rapidly and the uptick of these large screening programs are even subgroup testing is typically  also here is something that you dont see a step change suddenly happen but you start seeing an acceleration overtime to open to our plan this year, but we are fully in line with our expectations for the Chinese market. The second question was on the Japanese market. In Japan, there was one disruption in 2013 that had to do with the supply chain being disrupted for certain period of time for the Japanese market which led to the loss of one account as described in Japan. And we have been very successful in regaining share in the Japanese market altogether with that one exception, but the evidence is very clear now. In the meantime also been built that, Ill turn it to solutions. Solutions are providing significantly superior results and I think thats strong evidence. Its just a matter of time hopefully for this two to convert and we are doing all we can I think the rest of the world has clearly shown that the QuantiFERON solution is the way to go. In terms of the QuantiFERON post generation product we are progressing very well on that product that had some unique new features, I will be to that for now, that also open-up new opportunities and new market segment and we will talk about as that launch nears. Operator The next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc Good afternoon and thank you. Question on liquid biopsy this is an area where I think you have been talking little bit more about the assess that you have and the opportunity for growth, that said it is clearly a lot about the technologies out there in the marketplace that could be disruptive. So, how would you kind of put the opportunity in the liquid biopsy in context for your M&A priorities versus some of the other initiatives you had in informatics or sequencing for example? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, see for us liquid biopsy is a sample technology basically the stability to enrich various scar some amounts of molecular targets from biopsy is that are more easily accessible than tissue. And they are in that market, I am not really sure what you are referring to disruptive change but in the free circulating DNA area we have extremely a strong position in that area, and also in the RNA and the fixes more RNA I think we are basically only wide available products in the market today. And so we are definitely working intensely to standardize sample technologies in these markets just like weve done in so many other areas of sample processing where we have shares of 56% to 70%. And this is the starting point for liquid biopsy processing. We have not been active in circulating tumor cells and that might be what you are referring to, circulating tumor, tumor cells have some benefits, they also have some disadvantages and we see with a new molecular techniques that exosomes and DNA is becoming a method of choice. Started out I think the cancer is going to bit a real opportunity to show the benefits of these technologies, currently a lot of the activities in the area of that been testing that has slightly different needs and thats maybe on the long-term separate area not really a liquid biopsy as we would define it ultimately for diagnostic testing for instance for tumors. In terms of the M&A if you ask is there something out there that would be interesting for us to acquire and lipid biopsies had struggled to find something that with the something that we would need to actually deliver on a very exciting future for our liquid biopsy franchise. So that mean that the focus that we have in M&A is clearly along the growth drivers and bioinformatics was a big focus over the last 18 months, will continue to be, and we are, however, also looking at other areas and I think the news flow will then further validate that. Operator The next question is from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias  Citigroup Afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about the early days of the C. diffs as they uptake. How are you finding that market to be just given the landscape? And as a related question, if I could, it seems like CMV and MC, they both sort of need to have assays for hospital labs. So Id be curious just to hear how much bundling, if any, youre doing there with those tests? Peer M. Schatz Absolutely. I think there are two  youre actually right that hospitals, its a cornerstone for hospital and the QIAsymphony provides an excellent testing platform for these medium-sized hospitals at it allows broad array of different tests including LDTs be on it. The same is true for cytomegalovirus. That should be closer to patients as it is a monitoring assay. We are seeing a very significant interest in C. diff. We already converted first accounts. We have a very strong franchise already in CMV. Were at CMV franchise since almost 10 years. We were under an exception from FDA to continue selling the ASR prior to the approval of the CMV assay this year, which basically allows us now to convert the existing uses over into the PMA approved product. So CMV is not a new area for us. Its one in transplantation testing where we have an incredibly strong franchise and I think one that well be able to talk more about and also going forward. Theres a lot of exciting things happening in this area. And healthcare-acquired infection, this is simply and add-on to  at QIAGEN, need to provide value to the hospitals that are thinking about putting in some patient in that assay, also gives a certain amount of base volume that allows (indiscernible) fab. Operator The next question is from Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Zarak Khurshid  Wedbush Securities Hi, there. Good afternoon. A couple of question on cash flow for Roland. How did the working capital improvement play into cash flow? And then how sustainable might that be? And generally how much does HPV contribute to cash flow? Thanks, guys. Roland Sackers Working capital improvement is a smaller part of it. It is clearly one part, but at the same time we see the majority coming from operational efficiency really about the project we started earlier in 2013 and finally I would say coming all the time and giving us quite significant impact here. So I think there is clearly something where we believe also going forward we see even larger contribution coming from as we again typically towards these efficiency programs by starting and rolling it out on a limited area and then you take it over a region on to a global base, so that (indiscernible) controlled set up. At the same time of course youre creating larger impact on longer time period. The other thing what we of course to your second question around its re-contributions. As (indiscernible) clearly still is a business with a good gross margin, at the same time you have to have in mind that still its part of our business which has two sales forces, as you know we have a clinical and laboratory sales force. So in terms of actually in EBIT contribution, I would say its below company average and I think it is also something to have in mind and its also the reason why we are able actually to absorb quite nicely the impacts we are seeing here from the revenue side. And at the same time with bioinformatics, of course we have a huge opportunity going forward, because bioinformatics to a large part has even a higher gross margin than we have seen and used to from those previous slides. I would say the product mix is also quite helpful for us. Operator The next question is from Vijay Kumar of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar  ISI Group LLC Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Peer, I had a big picture question for you and I guess when you look at the (indiscernible), obviously you had a challenging time with some of the challenges in U.S. on HPV side. I guess the question is after 2015 right in resuming the HPV stabilizing. I think the core part of your business has been doing high singles, right. And I think if you look at what the key growth drivers out there, it should have basely been QuantiFERON-TB and profiling within the molecular diagnostics. I guess given some of your comments on QTB were reasonable. That market is expanding and 20% growth rate in QTB is a reasonable assumption but in the medium term I guess, whats going to drive that strong double digits within profiling or other parts of your diagnostic business right? And to that extent how key is gene expert to the thesis? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz Sure. If you look at the portfolio, the diagnostics portfolio overall you saw very high double digit growth again in the third quarter excluding the HPV headwinds and these are significant degree of pricing headwind. So we still maintain very large number of accounts. Now this product is down to 5% or lesser sales going forward. So I think were seeing stabilization probably happened over the course of 2015, which means at the rest of the growth, it seems to shine through and while clearly were fully aware this is an impact that we are moving through.  And therefore, it also demands a certain amount. Attention, if you look at the diagnostics portfolio, you have several hundred millions of dollars of profiling test and franchise that where you have the QIAsymphony now being the hardware for  or the carrier for all that and we are moving forward quite aggressively in an early stage of that product life cycle. So we talked about four approvals in the state, but we have about 23 assays in Europe running on this and we just launched the whole hospital acquired infections portfolio in Europe and whole suite of STB products as well. And are really charging ahead in the 60% of the world which is not the United States and in the United States were seeing very good uptake following the FDA approval. Thats several hundred millions of dollars of opportunity that we basically have there and personalized healthcare, we talked about  I couldnt imagine something more fascinating, were seeing the assay technologies, the platforms, even the software elements not come together. Were signing up record agreements that couldnt image anybody having even  even though the number of partnerships that we have in molecular field and which will be proven to capabilities also in the regulatory front in the U.S. but also globally. And so that franchise doesnt need now a rocket or an engine or anything. This is a very long-term growth driver in QuantiFERON certainly as well that has already proven very high growth rates and will continue going forward as we expect to do so as well. So if you just drawn the map and see HPV starting to lose its headwind impact, the growth profile is actually quite attractive. And if you would look at individual market segments, significant premium even compared to what we see from other players in this space. So we are aggressively funding growth drivers in the long-term even on the medium-term and they will have an impact even on the medium-term on the growth profile and the profitability of the company. Because as was mentioned before clearly if you have a headwinds on HPV that also has an impact on the operating income and cash flows question just alluded to before and thats something we are working through as well. And that will hopefully then move out of the picture in 2015 and obviously 2015 with a number of different launches only mentioned Next-Gen, but there are 100s of other things that are coming forward in this area as well, I think it could be an exciting year for us. Operator Next question is from Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please go ahead. Daniel L. Leonard  Leerink Swann LLC Thank you. Another one on HPV, so for U.S. HPV to be a three point headwind in 2015 that seems to imply another decline of about 40% year-over-year. So my question is one is that, is that math right? And then two as you look now your budget for 2014 and U.S. HPV is coming in, I think was there any plant, is there a primary  you have a number of growth drivers, but is there a primary offset youd put on the pedestal to say that this offset the decline in HPV. Peer M. Schatz We expect the declines to be pretty similar to what it was this year, so we had a decline this year plus or minus 30%. And the decline was to a significant degree pricing. If you assume that that would continue for a certain period of time if these pricing levels have been set at a certain level, were not seeing dramatic declines anymore that was kind of like a step change, in particular, one competitor and then another following. That is kind of like floor at a level which is really not far away from commenting another test which kind of gives you a sense that this is  may be a level where you wouldnt see a similar step change, at least certainly not in terms of dollars. So from that perspective were actually fully in line with our targets for this year, came in pretty much as what we had predicted for the year, also in terms of overall headwind. But offset set is, if you look at the third quarter, you see almost 20% growth in the molecular diagnostics franchise, ex-HPV you see a very, very strong underlying growth which kind of like sometimes is not in the limelight, because we see QuantiFERON is a very strong $100 million growth driver and we see HPV as a negative impact. But just personalized healthcare and the profiling portfolio primarily symphony are very strong growth drivers. Operator Next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Elliott  Robert W. Baird & Co. Yes, thanks for letting me in here. First one on the instrument growth, as you mentioned really strong growth there, as far as that we seen it sometime. It was some of the pull out from the fourth quarter, I guess whats behind the growth and how stable is that? Peer M. Schatz Excuse me the audio was not  didnt work could you repeat the question? Im sorry. Jeffrey Elliott  Robert W. Baird & Co. Yes, the question is on the instrument growth in the third quarter, like you said as strong as weve seen in sometime with some of this pullback we had from the fourth quarter, or whats behind the growth you saw in the third quarter? Peer M. Schatz No, I think you sensed from the call in the second quarter that we were thats a good cash. We were quite satisfied with the instrument performance moving into the second half of the year, we made some changes in the way we managed the funnel and also in the way the instruments are packaged to our customers. So weve started to see a reemergence in growth in terms of the assay portfolio and new assays coming online that are reinvigorating growth of instrumentation sales. So, Id say that is more an execution issue. The teams have been doing a very good job since a few months managing that tunnel. Operator Next question is from Gunnar Romer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gunnar Romer  Deutsche Bank Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First one would be to Roland on the likely FX impact on your top line next year. I think this question was already asked earlier, but I probably missed the answer. So what would be your best guess given current spot rates? What the impact on your top line would be next year? And then, if I may have a second question on the companion diagnostics pipeline, how should we be thinking about that pipeline evolving into next year and potentially translating into, say, when you would be expecting the first significant contributions here? Roland Sackers Its Roland. Good question. Gunnar, of course if I take Deutsches expectations and we have still a significant drop to expect, but putting that aside if you would use current rate, I actually dont think it will be too much of them over all topic for us. We probably have it in a  impact that you will see on the warning side, not necessary in terms of changing our overall growth rate, which is also reason why we look at constant exchange rate go for it on the revenue side, which makes it then very transparent in terms of what is overall growth rate going forward on the revenue side. On the profitability side, I would say probably its helpful of course on the modern side. Its the question on the absolute dollar side. It would stay as it is right now. It is probably also something, which is more on the warming, might be $0.01, might be $0.02 on a full year basis. So this year if you see so far for the nine months period it small as nothing and we expect now up to $0.01 for the remaining quarter. Again, Im not too pessimistic on the currency side. Our natural hedge on the profitability side is actually working quite nice, duplicate it only by this event if you see one specific country see on Brazil, see on Turkey as Australia. And so those significant development in a typical key areas, but typically thats also brought out on a global basis as some other countries who are in a different direction. So again we have to mention it and we do so, but at the same time I think it very well manageable from our perspective Gunnar Romer  Deutsche Bank Yes, I think its a very specific profile that we have as an overall company. Back to your first question, how do we see the revenues typically we can. So again to reiterate there as you guys pre-components within that personal healthcare portfolio a part of it for the minority its a  that are service related revenues. The development a milestones that we are able to achieve, that sometime difficult for us to manage you can usually have the percent maybe even 2% related inorganic growth, sometimes floating up and down for an overall companies or easily $5 million to $6 million up and down per quarter. In terms of the development milestones, that doesnt really mean much these are multi-year programs and were typically paid on the specific milestones to offset the cost of developments. And then we have the part of majority is consumable and assay and instrument related and that is a very fast growth on our portfolio and together approaching $100 million. This is a very important large franchise for us that typically then you generate revenues when the assays kick in where less interested in the development milestones as more an opportunity cost protection, in case the program is discontinued. We charge cost plus here with the assays however that as where we effectively can scale on a global basis. And there we already have our 20 assays in Europe we have now for in the states that are approved and we are moving forward quite aggressively and building that menu. Again, we just filed the further PMA that we cant talk about the majority of our partnerships as we can talk about and as you just see the headline numbers tip of the iceberg that is already quite impressive. Operator The next question is from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Tim Evans  Wells Fargo Securities Hi, thank you. I was hoping that might ask a little bit more about the strength in the instruments, particularly in the pharma customer base. Can you talk about a little bit more about the dynamics there and maybe also by geographic region. Peer M. Schatz Sure. If we talk about pharma, its predominantly U.S. into certain degree of the Europe, but in particular if we look at instrumentation in the third quarter of this year and hopefully this will secure into future period, instruments as always a little bit more a lumpy business spending on the instrument the capital cycles and the budget cycles. But effectively taking the portfolio that we have and its a very, very good portfolio across sample and assay technologies. We simply improved the final management in this area and focused more on the instrumentation side versus in the first half of the year where were more focused on some of the reagent and the new assays that were coming in the next-gen sequencing portfolio, and others that are actually doing very well. And so with additional resources on the instrument funnel, starting in the second quarter of this year moving into the third you start, you hopefully see the first times here in the third quarter and you look forward to further success in that area. Operator The next question is from Paul Knight of Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Knight  Janney Capital Markets Good evening. What are the other target growth rate on the personalized medicine business or what should we really think for on a multi-year period, is it contract-by-contract or should we assume 20% type growth, whats your thought on the business plan? Peer M. Schatz If you look at the overall revenue in that area, it can be anywhere between 20% to 30%, is related to development mile stones. And we dont expect this to grow at very high growth rates and were scaling like crazy in the Manchester side that we have, where we already have a couple of 100 assay developers. And for those of you who know the industry, this is probably one of the largest assay development sites in the world. And were scaling with quite aggressively that capability there. But that wont grow at the same growth rate as scalability of a kit sale and an instrument or reagent sales to pathology labs. So be the real-time PCR, or be the next generation sequencing panels, or be it the related equipment and consumable for that, we see a very strong growth opportunity for this and were in the early days of personalized medicine. Were not playing it for 2015 and 2016, these are growth rates that we assume are well in the double digits, but were planning it for, also here this is a very long term high growth driver for us, just like QuantiFERON, just like QIAsymphony, just like Bioinformatics and just like NGS. So were lining up multiple growth cylinders that have multi-year perspective and funnel them and fueling them aggressively. John Gilardi So, thank you very much Peer and with that I would like to close this conference call, and thank all of you for your participation.

Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) One moment please for the first question. First question is from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Derik de Bruin  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good afternoon. Peer M. Schatz Hi, Derik. How are you? Derik de Bruin  Bank of America Merrill Lynch Youve made some really good progress in the off margin this year, 100 basis points of expansion and I guess how should we think about that for 2015, particularly since the currencies I know will potentially give you some benefit. And I guess just also from modeling purposes, how are you sort of thinking about the effects on the top line for next year? Peer M. Schatz Roland, you want to take that? Roland Sackers Yes, sure. Hi, Derik. Generally we still see that as a positive (indiscernible) we will create a few over the last 12 months to 18 months. And so, we want to believe that were able to continue that positive trend also into the quarter for 2015. Clearly its also to a certain extend depending to the revenue guidance which we are giving only next year. Nevertheless, if you look on the different drivers for that, a couple of them are doing quite well. If you look on our [shared] (ph) service centers all the things we were able to do in administration, integration and globalization of all procurement efforts. So we feel comfortable at least on the bill funds. And again you see it also now, finally, really pushing its too on the cash flow side, those things coming together quite nicely. Operator Next question is Daniel Wendorff with Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff  Commerzbank AG Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. And its actually relating the HPV franchise and Peer you mentioned that number of contracts were prolonged in the U.S. and this with broaden the first half 2015. So my question on that is and how long do these contracts normally last? If I cut it right for the past, these were around two year contract, is that still valid? Peer M. Schatz Hello, Daniel. So its a well, were signing every year hundreds of agreements that are coming up for renewal and they can extend anywhere between even out to one year Id say the majority are some in the range of three years. And the important thing for us clearly this year is the competition has reached at the pricing levels. That were actually able to secure very large portion of them, even now despite that the pricing is lower it gives us very strong market share and position also within these accounts for several years to come from which we can expand with other offerings. So its typically in the range of a few years, the average duration assumed is around three years. Operator The next question is from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho W. Peterson  JPMorgan Chase & Co. Thanks. I guess question on Bioinformatics, you announced where weve seen your higher, you announced the Genomics England project and youve kind of integrated Ingenuity with the Cancer Research what mentioned. So can you maybe just talk about a) the patient of Genomics England when that flows through the other still gaps you need to fill on the informatics side. And then see, just any feedback on Ingenuity with the Cancer Research Workbench solutions. Peer M. Schatz Sure. So in terms of the portfolio to started out with that we have an incredibly strong position in secondary analysis, which we are expanding through offerings the retailer to specific type of users be the cancer researchers or others. So just for those you have never seen these types, the analysis, the secondary analysis of next-generation sequencing data is incredibly complex with many, many different ways to ultimately get to your at the definitional of what is a variant. And were expanding and tailoring that to the different needs were already today have by far the largest offering in this base. And so that position is one that were building from a real position strength and that will continue and very similar in the interpretation area where our knowledge bases are  were actually accelerating the efforts in this area to further broaden their capabilities and this is going at a very rapid pace. What you saw for instance at ASHG is that were now starting to integrate them and not only the Ingenuity Variant Analysis or the Ingenuity Clinical systems with secondary analysis from CLC bio, but now also the HCMD franchises from BIOBASE and the problem in bioinformatics today is that there are many, many different tools but there are many small individual tools that are not aggregated. Were creating something very seamless for our customers targeted towards their applications. The response of the market is actually very, very positive. So the seamlessness takes a lot complexity in interface management out of the system, which software is just deadly and systems continue to be upgraded and enhanced over time to ensure certain seamlessness is extremely valuable for our customers. Insurance is now large contracts. We are very successful as obviously the key go to resource for interpretation secondary analysis that we have a strong  very strong and competitive position to offer. We have mentioned the 250,000 genomes that were for instance processed already or our genomic samples that were processed. This compares to a few 100 or few 1000 that you see even in very large institutions. So this number 250,000 is a one that it is just miles ahead of anything else that is out there. And I think this puts us into a very strong position for large scale genomic analysis studies that for instance youve referred to before. Operator Your next question is from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Peter Lawson  Mizuho Securities Yes, just on the HPV business. Where are you seeing the most pressures that from large competitors or small private companies? And then when do you think that business stabilizes? Peer M. Schatz Its very different in terms of the geography. So the HPV franchise ex-U.S. is actually doing quite well. Were very successful. Were winning almost every major tender where were moving ahead quite rapidly and develop, but also in less developed countries. In the United States  and there typically in ex-U.S., we see competition many, many players, small players, but we are  by far the majority share player there. Situation in the U.S. is very different that we clearly have a oligopoly or few players basically in this market. And what happened was that due to very poor uptick of competing tests, the pricing button was pushed and the pricing levels collapsed. And while we are still able to command a premium in many cases, it is quite clear that if customers have price of x, it is tough to charge to 2x. So, weve been forced to go along with those pricing levels. Competition is in the States across the three other players basically that are on the market, really only two at the moment. Operator The next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst Hi, this is [Ryan Decker] (ph) filling-in for Doug. Couple on QuantiFERON. How was the launch in China tracking relative to your expectations firstly? Number two, can you talk a little bit about QuantiFERON in Japan and how successful youve been in winning back those accounts that you lost previously? And lastly, can you provide any additional color on commercialization timelines for TB Plus? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz Sure. So the first question, QuantiFERON, China is moving ahead well. As you know, we were the key partner in all of the major studies that provide credits in groundbreaking, also clinical evidence for the Chinese market. Our product was a test of choice and therefore validated the benefits of our products quite impressively for the Chinese market. So, this is moving ahead quite rapidly and the uptick of these large screening programs are even subgroup testing is typically  also here is something that you dont see a step change suddenly happen but you start seeing an acceleration overtime to open to our plan this year, but we are fully in line with our expectations for the Chinese market. The second question was on the Japanese market. In Japan, there was one disruption in 2013 that had to do with the supply chain being disrupted for certain period of time for the Japanese market which led to the loss of one account as described in Japan. And we have been very successful in regaining share in the Japanese market altogether with that one exception, but the evidence is very clear now. In the meantime also been built that, Ill turn it to solutions. Solutions are providing significantly superior results and I think thats strong evidence. Its just a matter of time hopefully for this two to convert and we are doing all we can I think the rest of the world has clearly shown that the QuantiFERON solution is the way to go. In terms of the QuantiFERON post generation product we are progressing very well on that product that had some unique new features, I will be to that for now, that also open-up new opportunities and new market segment and we will talk about as that launch nears. Operator The next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Isaac Ro  Goldman Sachs Group, Inc Good afternoon and thank you. Question on liquid biopsy this is an area where I think you have been talking little bit more about the assess that you have and the opportunity for growth, that said it is clearly a lot about the technologies out there in the marketplace that could be disruptive. So, how would you kind of put the opportunity in the liquid biopsy in context for your M&A priorities versus some of the other initiatives you had in informatics or sequencing for example? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Well, see for us liquid biopsy is a sample technology basically the stability to enrich various scar some amounts of molecular targets from biopsy is that are more easily accessible than tissue. And they are in that market, I am not really sure what you are referring to disruptive change but in the free circulating DNA area we have extremely a strong position in that area, and also in the RNA and the fixes more RNA I think we are basically only wide available products in the market today. And so we are definitely working intensely to standardize sample technologies in these markets just like weve done in so many other areas of sample processing where we have shares of 56% to 70%. And this is the starting point for liquid biopsy processing. We have not been active in circulating tumor cells and that might be what you are referring to, circulating tumor, tumor cells have some benefits, they also have some disadvantages and we see with a new molecular techniques that exosomes and DNA is becoming a method of choice. Started out I think the cancer is going to bit a real opportunity to show the benefits of these technologies, currently a lot of the activities in the area of that been testing that has slightly different needs and thats maybe on the long-term separate area not really a liquid biopsy as we would define it ultimately for diagnostic testing for instance for tumors. In terms of the M&A if you ask is there something out there that would be interesting for us to acquire and lipid biopsies had struggled to find something that with the something that we would need to actually deliver on a very exciting future for our liquid biopsy franchise. So that mean that the focus that we have in M&A is clearly along the growth drivers and bioinformatics was a big focus over the last 18 months, will continue to be, and we are, however, also looking at other areas and I think the news flow will then further validate that. Operator The next question is from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Daniel Arias  Citigroup Afternoon. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about the early days of the C. diffs as they uptake. How are you finding that market to be just given the landscape? And as a related question, if I could, it seems like CMV and MC, they both sort of need to have assays for hospital labs. So Id be curious just to hear how much bundling, if any, youre doing there with those tests? Peer M. Schatz Absolutely. I think there are two  youre actually right that hospitals, its a cornerstone for hospital and the QIAsymphony provides an excellent testing platform for these medium-sized hospitals at it allows broad array of different tests including LDTs be on it. The same is true for cytomegalovirus. That should be closer to patients as it is a monitoring assay. We are seeing a very significant interest in C. diff. We already converted first accounts. We have a very strong franchise already in CMV. Were at CMV franchise since almost 10 years. We were under an exception from FDA to continue selling the ASR prior to the approval of the CMV assay this year, which basically allows us now to convert the existing uses over into the PMA approved product. So CMV is not a new area for us. Its one in transplantation testing where we have an incredibly strong franchise and I think one that well be able to talk more about and also going forward. Theres a lot of exciting things happening in this area. And healthcare-acquired infection, this is simply and add-on to  at QIAGEN, need to provide value to the hospitals that are thinking about putting in some patient in that assay, also gives a certain amount of base volume that allows (indiscernible) fab. Operator The next question is from Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. Zarak Khurshid  Wedbush Securities Hi, there. Good afternoon. A couple of question on cash flow for Roland. How did the working capital improvement play into cash flow? And then how sustainable might that be? And generally how much does HPV contribute to cash flow? Thanks, guys. Roland Sackers Working capital improvement is a smaller part of it. It is clearly one part, but at the same time we see the majority coming from operational efficiency really about the project we started earlier in 2013 and finally I would say coming all the time and giving us quite significant impact here. So I think there is clearly something where we believe also going forward we see even larger contribution coming from as we again typically towards these efficiency programs by starting and rolling it out on a limited area and then you take it over a region on to a global base, so that (indiscernible) controlled set up. At the same time of course youre creating larger impact on longer time period. The other thing what we of course to your second question around its re-contributions. As (indiscernible) clearly still is a business with a good gross margin, at the same time you have to have in mind that still its part of our business which has two sales forces, as you know we have a clinical and laboratory sales force. So in terms of actually in EBIT contribution, I would say its below company average and I think it is also something to have in mind and its also the reason why we are able actually to absorb quite nicely the impacts we are seeing here from the revenue side. And at the same time with bioinformatics, of course we have a huge opportunity going forward, because bioinformatics to a large part has even a higher gross margin than we have seen and used to from those previous slides. I would say the product mix is also quite helpful for us. Operator The next question is from Vijay Kumar of ISI Group. Please go ahead. Vijay Kumar  ISI Group LLC Hi, guys, thanks for taking my question. Peer, I had a big picture question for you and I guess when you look at the (indiscernible), obviously you had a challenging time with some of the challenges in U.S. on HPV side. I guess the question is after 2015 right in resuming the HPV stabilizing. I think the core part of your business has been doing high singles, right. And I think if you look at what the key growth drivers out there, it should have basely been QuantiFERON-TB and profiling within the molecular diagnostics. I guess given some of your comments on QTB were reasonable. That market is expanding and 20% growth rate in QTB is a reasonable assumption but in the medium term I guess, whats going to drive that strong double digits within profiling or other parts of your diagnostic business right? And to that extent how key is gene expert to the thesis? Thank you. Peer M. Schatz Sure. If you look at the portfolio, the diagnostics portfolio overall you saw very high double digit growth again in the third quarter excluding the HPV headwinds and these are significant degree of pricing headwind. So we still maintain very large number of accounts. Now this product is down to 5% or lesser sales going forward. So I think were seeing stabilization probably happened over the course of 2015, which means at the rest of the growth, it seems to shine through and while clearly were fully aware this is an impact that we are moving through.  And therefore, it also demands a certain amount. Attention, if you look at the diagnostics portfolio, you have several hundred millions of dollars of profiling test and franchise that where you have the QIAsymphony now being the hardware for  or the carrier for all that and we are moving forward quite aggressively in an early stage of that product life cycle. So we talked about four approvals in the state, but we have about 23 assays in Europe running on this and we just launched the whole hospital acquired infections portfolio in Europe and whole suite of STB products as well. And are really charging ahead in the 60% of the world which is not the United States and in the United States were seeing very good uptake following the FDA approval. Thats several hundred millions of dollars of opportunity that we basically have there and personalized healthcare, we talked about  I couldnt imagine something more fascinating, were seeing the assay technologies, the platforms, even the software elements not come together. Were signing up record agreements that couldnt image anybody having even  even though the number of partnerships that we have in molecular field and which will be proven to capabilities also in the regulatory front in the U.S. but also globally. And so that franchise doesnt need now a rocket or an engine or anything. This is a very long-term growth driver in QuantiFERON certainly as well that has already proven very high growth rates and will continue going forward as we expect to do so as well. So if you just drawn the map and see HPV starting to lose its headwind impact, the growth profile is actually quite attractive. And if you would look at individual market segments, significant premium even compared to what we see from other players in this space. So we are aggressively funding growth drivers in the long-term even on the medium-term and they will have an impact even on the medium-term on the growth profile and the profitability of the company. Because as was mentioned before clearly if you have a headwinds on HPV that also has an impact on the operating income and cash flows question just alluded to before and thats something we are working through as well. And that will hopefully then move out of the picture in 2015 and obviously 2015 with a number of different launches only mentioned Next-Gen, but there are 100s of other things that are coming forward in this area as well, I think it could be an exciting year for us. Operator Next question is from Dan Leonard of Leerink. Please go ahead. Daniel L. Leonard  Leerink Swann LLC Thank you. Another one on HPV, so for U.S. HPV to be a three point headwind in 2015 that seems to imply another decline of about 40% year-over-year. So my question is one is that, is that math right? And then two as you look now your budget for 2014 and U.S. HPV is coming in, I think was there any plant, is there a primary  you have a number of growth drivers, but is there a primary offset youd put on the pedestal to say that this offset the decline in HPV. Peer M. Schatz We expect the declines to be pretty similar to what it was this year, so we had a decline this year plus or minus 30%. And the decline was to a significant degree pricing. If you assume that that would continue for a certain period of time if these pricing levels have been set at a certain level, were not seeing dramatic declines anymore that was kind of like a step change, in particular, one competitor and then another following. That is kind of like floor at a level which is really not far away from commenting another test which kind of gives you a sense that this is  may be a level where you wouldnt see a similar step change, at least certainly not in terms of dollars. So from that perspective were actually fully in line with our targets for this year, came in pretty much as what we had predicted for the year, also in terms of overall headwind. But offset set is, if you look at the third quarter, you see almost 20% growth in the molecular diagnostics franchise, ex-HPV you see a very, very strong underlying growth which kind of like sometimes is not in the limelight, because we see QuantiFERON is a very strong $100 million growth driver and we see HPV as a negative impact. But just personalized healthcare and the profiling portfolio primarily symphony are very strong growth drivers. Operator Next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Jeffrey Elliott  Robert W. Baird & Co. Yes, thanks for letting me in here. First one on the instrument growth, as you mentioned really strong growth there, as far as that we seen it sometime. It was some of the pull out from the fourth quarter, I guess whats behind the growth and how stable is that? Peer M. Schatz Excuse me the audio was not  didnt work could you repeat the question? Im sorry. Jeffrey Elliott  Robert W. Baird & Co. Yes, the question is on the instrument growth in the third quarter, like you said as strong as weve seen in sometime with some of this pullback we had from the fourth quarter, or whats behind the growth you saw in the third quarter? Peer M. Schatz No, I think you sensed from the call in the second quarter that we were thats a good cash. We were quite satisfied with the instrument performance moving into the second half of the year, we made some changes in the way we managed the funnel and also in the way the instruments are packaged to our customers. So weve started to see a reemergence in growth in terms of the assay portfolio and new assays coming online that are reinvigorating growth of instrumentation sales. So, Id say that is more an execution issue. The teams have been doing a very good job since a few months managing that tunnel. Operator Next question is from Gunnar Romer of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Gunnar Romer  Deutsche Bank Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First one would be to Roland on the likely FX impact on your top line next year. I think this question was already asked earlier, but I probably missed the answer. So what would be your best guess given current spot rates? What the impact on your top line would be next year? And then, if I may have a second question on the companion diagnostics pipeline, how should we be thinking about that pipeline evolving into next year and potentially translating into, say, when you would be expecting the first significant contributions here? Roland Sackers Its Roland. Good question. Gunnar, of course if I take Deutsches expectations and we have still a significant drop to expect, but putting that aside if you would use current rate, I actually dont think it will be too much of them over all topic for us. We probably have it in a  impact that you will see on the warning side, not necessary in terms of changing our overall growth rate, which is also reason why we look at constant exchange rate go for it on the revenue side, which makes it then very transparent in terms of what is overall growth rate going forward on the revenue side. On the profitability side, I would say probably its helpful of course on the modern side. Its the question on the absolute dollar side. It would stay as it is right now. It is probably also something, which is more on the warming, might be $0.01, might be $0.02 on a full year basis. So this year if you see so far for the nine months period it small as nothing and we expect now up to $0.01 for the remaining quarter. Again, Im not too pessimistic on the currency side. Our natural hedge on the profitability side is actually working quite nice, duplicate it only by this event if you see one specific country see on Brazil, see on Turkey as Australia. And so those significant development in a typical key areas, but typically thats also brought out on a global basis as some other countries who are in a different direction. So again we have to mention it and we do so, but at the same time I think it very well manageable from our perspective Gunnar Romer  Deutsche Bank Yes, I think its a very specific profile that we have as an overall company. Back to your first question, how do we see the revenues typically we can. So again to reiterate there as you guys pre-components within that personal healthcare portfolio a part of it for the minority its a  that are service related revenues. The development a milestones that we are able to achieve, that sometime difficult for us to manage you can usually have the percent maybe even 2% related inorganic growth, sometimes floating up and down for an overall companies or easily $5 million to $6 million up and down per quarter. In terms of the development milestones, that doesnt really mean much these are multi-year programs and were typically paid on the specific milestones to offset the cost of developments. And then we have the part of majority is consumable and assay and instrument related and that is a very fast growth on our portfolio and together approaching $100 million. This is a very important large franchise for us that typically then you generate revenues when the assays kick in where less interested in the development milestones as more an opportunity cost protection, in case the program is discontinued. We charge cost plus here with the assays however that as where we effectively can scale on a global basis. And there we already have our 20 assays in Europe we have now for in the states that are approved and we are moving forward quite aggressively and building that menu. Again, we just filed the further PMA that we cant talk about the majority of our partnerships as we can talk about and as you just see the headline numbers tip of the iceberg that is already quite impressive. Operator The next question is from Tim Evans of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Tim Evans  Wells Fargo Securities Hi, thank you. I was hoping that might ask a little bit more about the strength in the instruments, particularly in the pharma customer base. Can you talk about a little bit more about the dynamics there and maybe also by geographic region. Peer M. Schatz Sure. If we talk about pharma, its predominantly U.S. into certain degree of the Europe, but in particular if we look at instrumentation in the third quarter of this year and hopefully this will secure into future period, instruments as always a little bit more a lumpy business spending on the instrument the capital cycles and the budget cycles. But effectively taking the portfolio that we have and its a very, very good portfolio across sample and assay technologies. We simply improved the final management in this area and focused more on the instrumentation side versus in the first half of the year where were more focused on some of the reagent and the new assays that were coming in the next-gen sequencing portfolio, and others that are actually doing very well. And so with additional resources on the instrument funnel, starting in the second quarter of this year moving into the third you start, you hopefully see the first times here in the third quarter and you look forward to further success in that area. Operator The next question is from Paul Knight of Janney Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Knight  Janney Capital Markets Good evening. What are the other target growth rate on the personalized medicine business or what should we really think for on a multi-year period, is it contract-by-contract or should we assume 20% type growth, whats your thought on the business plan? Peer M. Schatz If you look at the overall revenue in that area, it can be anywhere between 20% to 30%, is related to development mile stones. And we dont expect this to grow at very high growth rates and were scaling like crazy in the Manchester side that we have, where we already have a couple of 100 assay developers. And for those of you who know the industry, this is probably one of the largest assay development sites in the world. And were scaling with quite aggressively that capability there. But that wont grow at the same growth rate as scalability of a kit sale and an instrument or reagent sales to pathology labs. So be the real-time PCR, or be the next generation sequencing panels, or be it the related equipment and consumable for that, we see a very strong growth opportunity for this and were in the early days of personalized medicine. Were not playing it for 2015 and 2016, these are growth rates that we assume are well in the double digits, but were planning it for, also here this is a very long term high growth driver for us, just like QuantiFERON, just like QIAsymphony, just like Bioinformatics and just like NGS. So were lining up multiple growth cylinders that have multi-year perspective and funnel them and fueling them aggressively. John Gilardi So, thank you very much Peer and with that I would like to close this conference call, and thank all of you for your participation. If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to give us a call. Thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the QIAGENs Conference Call.

I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Thank you, John. Hello, and welcome to our call today to discuss results for 2014 and the fourth quarter and also to provide our perspectives and goals for 2015. I have a few messages for you as an overview. The first, we delivered solid results for 2014, driven by the continued strong performance of our growth drivers. Our teams made important progress on the transformation of QIAGEN. As for 2015, we're determined to build momentum behind our core portfolio, especially the growth drivers that are now providing about 30% of our sales as we work through the final year of significant U.S. HPV headwinds. In terms of the results, they were in line with our preannouncement on January 11. As you saw in the press release on Wednesday, adjusted net sales rose 4% at constant exchange rates in the fourth quarter of 2014. That was the same rate for the full year and both were in line with our communicated targets. Most important, sales rose 9% for the year when excluding U.S. HPV products and now providing about 95% of total sales. In terms of earnings, adjusted EPS was $1 per share for the year. This included $0.08 of mainly noncash restructuring charges for technology-related impairments. And so that means to achieve our guidance $1.08 before the charges. When looking at the adjusted EPS trends in recent years, keep in mind that we changed our adjustment policy as of the first quarter of 2014, so a year ago, involving share-based compensation and restructuring charges, and on a like-for-like basis, we have seen a solid increase. We also had strong free cash flow of $201 million for the year, which was up 15% from 2013. Second, we are moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth from our core portfolio, creating a foundation for sustainable and long-term expansion that we believe should become more visible later in 2015 and certainly in 2016. Third, we are committed to disciplined capital allocation. You saw this with our announcement that we acquired the Enzymatics reagents portfolio, which added a unique group of differentiated enzymology product that have played a critical role in enabling greater use of next-generation sequencing. We also announced earlier this month plans to remove about 10 million shares of risk from our diluted share count through the repurchase of the 2024 convertible notes. We currently expect this to cost about $250 million and the process is moving along towards completion in spring 2015. And as a last point, we have set goals for another year of higher sales and adjusted earnings in 2015 based on current exchange rates. Like many other companies, we will also face some currency headwinds based on the current rates, and Roland will discuss this topic. So in summary, we are pleased with the performance in 2014 and preparing for further innovation and growth in 2015. I'm now on Slide 5 and want to share some perspectives on the sales development in 2014. As you know, we are working through the last phases of pressure on our U.S. HPV franchise, which has primarily come from intense price pressure. Looking at the graph on the right side, you can see that we actually had a 5 percentage point of headwind in 2014, which was above our expectations for about 4 points. At the same time, we generated 9% in constant exchange rate growth from the rest of our portfolio, and we see this as one of the fastest growth rates in our industry. We saw an even stronger dynamic in the fourth quarter, which you see on the left side of this chart with 6 points of headwind in the quarter, but the rest of the portfolio, more than compensating for that with 10% constant exchange rate growth. These results show we achieved our 2014 goals to deliver above-market sales growth from our core portfolio, which matters the most for our future growth ambitions against the decline in the U.S. HPV sales. Moving to Slide 6. We have broken out some detail on growth rates and sales to underscore the transformation we have been making during the last few years. As you look at the growth rates and sales contributions, you see how the headwinds from U.S. HPV product sales were more than offset by the underlying solid performance and in particular, the growing share coming from our 5 growth drivers, which is now at about 30% of the total sales base. In this way, QIAGEN has delivered above-market growth in recent years, and this will become more apparent in 2015 and beyond as the HPV headwinds dissipate. We will provide some perspectives on these trends for 2015 and beyond later in the presentation. I'm now on Slide 7 to provide an overview of results for our 4 customer classes. Molecular Diagnostics represents about half of our sales and delivered 4% constant exchange rate gains for the year and a similar 3% constant exchange rate pace for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the U.S. HPV headwinds were more than offset by the underlying solid performance, with 16% constant exchange rate growth in the rest of the MDx portfolio. The gains in Molecular Diagnostics are coming across our portfolio and in particular, from the growth drivers. The QIAsymphony system, a portfolio of profiling assays that are used for disease detection and monitoring, showed ongoing double-digit constant exchange rate growth. Our QuantiFERON latent TB test exceeded $100 million of sales for the first time in 2014 although contributions in the fourth quarter showed a slower-growth pace, in part due to the start of transitioning to the new fourth-generation CE-IVD mark version in some markets. Our Personalized Healthcare portfolio also achieved more than $100 million of sales on growth in kit sales as well as significant increase in pharma codevelopment payments, in particular, in the fourth quarter of 2014. The improvements you see for the full year and the fourth quarter were further supported by our industry-leading bioinformatics portfolio, which was created through the acquisitions of Ingenuity, CLC and BIOBASE and integration with our own activities. The acquisition of Enzymatics was completed in December so it did not have an impact on these results. In the Life Sciences, we saw improving trends in the fourth quarter in Applied Testing, which had a very strong second half of the year and grew in line with our high single-digit constant exchange rate target for the full year. Pharma experienced improving demand in the Americas during 2014 but slower trends in other markets. In Academia, we saw improving demand in the fourth quarter, particularly in the United States, with mid-single digit constant exchange rate growth in both instruments and consumables. For 2015, we expect sentiment to be equal to or better than the trends in 2014, but we're taking an overall cautious view since funding levels are still below levels seen a few years ago. We're also watching the current macroeconomic trends in Europe and other markets. With that, I would like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. I'm now on Slide 8 and would like to review the results in more detail. In terms of adjusted net sales, we delivered 4% growth at constant exchange rates for both the fourth quarter and the full year, but we saw diverging trends in terms of the currency impact. For the full year, we had an adverse impact of about 1 percentage point, but this became much more pronounced in the fourth quarter with an impact of about 4 percentage points as the dollar strengthened considerably against a number of currencies compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Sales growth for the year was evenly split between contributions from the bioinformatics acquisitions and the rest of the business. For the fourth quarter, this split was 1 point from acquisitions and 3 from the rest of our portfolio. The Enzymatics acquisition was completed in December so very little for 2014. As you saw in our preannouncement following the Enzymatics acquisition, we decided to take $22 million of business integration acquisition-related charges in the fourth quarter of 2014 and of which about $18 million were noncash charges. These charges included closing our Gaithersburg, Maryland site as we build up activities in the Boston area. And in line with our policy, these charges were excluded from adjusted results. At the same time, we also decided to take a restructuring charge of USD 25.5 million, of which about $20 million were noncash items. These charges mainly involve the impairment of technology-related assets. In line with our new policy, these restructuring charges were not excluded from adjusted results. As a result, adjusted operating income declined 2% for the year and adjusted operating income margin declined to 23.2% of sales from 24.4% in 2013. When you exclude the restructuring charge from the full year 2014 results, the adjusted operating income was up about 60 basis points to 25.1% of sales, and this was even above absorbing -- this was even after absorbing about 100 basis points of dilution from investments into bioinformatics. For the fourth quarter of 2014, the adjusted operating margin, excluding the restructuring charge, was 26.9% of sales, and the adjusted gross margin was 72.1%, so this show the solid underlying performance. As for the distribution of the restructuring charges, about $16 million were in gross margin, while about $4 million were in marketing, about $2 million in sales and about $3 million in admin. I want to remind you that about $20 million of these charges were noncash. In terms of the full year margin trends, we had higher R&D expenses in 2014 and those were about 12% of sales. These investments made to support various Molecular Diagnostics clinical development projects and also the GeneReader NGS workflow. However, we generated margin gain in sales, marketing and administration, and here, we are seeing the benefits of our recent efficiency programs. Moving down the income statement, adjusted net income for the full year was also down slightly and adjusted EPS was $1 per share when including the $0.08 from the restructuring charge, and $1.01 at constant exchange rates. I'm now on Slide 9 to review our adjusted sales in the fourth quarter by region and product category. In terms of the region, the Europe/Middle East/Africa region led the performance in 2014, delivering 9% growth at constant exchange rates and contributing about 1/3 of sales of solid growth in Germany, France, the United Kingdom and Turkey, along with expansions in the Nordic countries. Molecular Diagnostics sales grew at a double-digit pace and Applied Testing added to the gains, but Pharma and Academia results were slightly lower. The Americas showed largely unchanged 2014 sales compared to 2013, but grew 11% when excluding the U.S. HPV headwinds, thanks to underlying growth in the U.S. and Brazil, while Mexico declined due to the timing of tenders compared to 2013. The Asia-Pacific/Japan region had solid results in the second half after modest gains in the first half. And full year sales rose 8% at constant exchange rates. China was a key driver, growing the largest region, along with double-digit constant exchange rate gains in Korea and improving growth trends in Japan. The top 7 emerging markets generated 5% constant exchange rate growth for the year, providing about 40% of total sales. This was below the double-digit constant exchange rate growth rates seen in the past, and the reason was a sharp full year sales decline in Russia. On the positive side, we saw solid double-digit incremental growth in Turkey, Korea and Brazil. On this slide, you also see results for our product categories. Sales of consumables and other revenues, which includes bioinformatics sales, maintained growth at a low to mid-single digit constant exchange rate pace during 2014 and were up 4% constant exchange rate for the year. Instrument sales advanced at the strongest quarterly pace in more than 2 years in the fourth quarter, delivering 18% growth at constant exchange rates and underpinning the 8% constant exchange rate increase for the full year. These gains include rising contributions from QIAsymphony placements as well as instrument service revenues. Moving to Slide 10. Here you have an update on our balance sheet and cash flow position. On the right side of the slide, you'll see the improving trend in free cash flow during the course of 2014, leading to a 15% increase over 2013. These results show we are generating an increased level of cash from the business and starting to see more benefits from our efficiency programs. Even in light of the share repurchase program and targeted acquisitions, we continue to have good liquidity and a manageable net debt position. Leverage increased slightly to 1.3x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA at the end of 2014 compared to 1.1x at the end of 2013. These figures do not include the anticipated cash out of about $250 million to complete the repurchase of the 2024 convertible notes. All of the outstanding notes have been tendered and canceled, and we expect to complete the overall process in the spring. If you were to include this in our year-end balance sheet, leverage would have been about 1.5x net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. In terms of adjusted EPS, we see this purchase also being relatively neutral for 2015 since we have a negative tax rate impact and reduced interest income against a lower share count and reduced interest expenses. Also, the [indiscernible]million share repurchase program is still underway with about $50 million remaining in this tranche. I would like to now hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes. Thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 11 to review the progress of our growth drivers in 2014 and some of the goals we have set for 2015. On the QIAsymphony automation platform, we have delivered more than 250 new placements in 2014, which put us well over the 1,250 cumulative placements at the end of the year, making one of the most widely placed systems for medium-throughput molecular processing. A key driver is the expanding menu, with the addition of 8 tests in 2014 in the United States and/or Europe on the Rotor-Gene Q, the PCR component of this workflow. We've set a new goal to exceed 1,500 cumulative placements at the end of 2015 as well. On Personalized Healthcare, which generated more than $100 million of sales, we had big achievements in expanding our portfolio of partnerships as well as expanding our portfolio to span PCR next-generation sequencing and Modaplex technologies and also in the area of liquid biopsies. Earlier this month, we announced the first-ever regulated CE-IVD for a liquid biopsy companion diagnostic in lung cancer, and this was with AstraZeneca and their targeted therapy, IRESSA. We also completed a U.S. submission for a companion diagnostic paired with IRESSA in 2014. Our status as the preferred partner for these codevelopment agreements was solidified with the announcement in November of a new agreement with Novartis, which marks the ninth of these master collaboration agreements and comes after the Astellas agreement earlier in 2014. We're working on a number of potential commissions for 2015, but these depend upon the Pharma partner pipelines. Moving to QuantiFERON, this product exceeded $100 million of sales for the first time in 2014. We are maintaining our target for 20% constant exchange rate growth in 2015, and the recent launch of the CE-IVD version of the fourth generation assay, known as QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus, gives us an additional clinical and workflow benefit portfolio to drive share conversion in this $1 billion market opportunity. In bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing, we made a lot of progress during 2014 to bring together our bioinformatics businesses and then to begin integrating this offering with our universal next-generation sequencing solutions. A key milestone was the integration of our GeneRead DNAseq V2 gene panels for use in cancer and translational research applications with our Ingenuity Variant Analysis bioinformatics solution. A key milestone in 2015 will be the commercialization of Ingenuity Clinical, which is the name we are using for this decision support solution during development. This fully integrated web-based workflow has performed well in early access testing and further demonstrating its unique ability to scale the interpretation of sequencing data from next-generation sequencing molecular test service offerings. You'll be hearing more about this product and other advances in this business area during the year. And on the GeneReader, we are moving on track for commercialization in the second half of 2015 and remain convinced that this solution will have a unique opportunity to help to drive the adoption of next-generation sequencing in healthcare and the clinical research setting by addressing the need for a complete workflow with powerful analysis and interpretation solutions from sample to insight. I'm now on Slide 12 to update you on an example of the expansion of our transplantation portfolio, which we see as having a huge potential and a differentiated profile against the competition. This portfolio is also great example how synergistic the unique and novel premolecular QuantiFERON technology is with our leading molecular technology such as PCR and next-generation sequencing. This week, we announced the commercialization of QuantiFERON Monitor, which is based on the same technology platform as our TB detection test and will provide clinicians with information on a transplant patient's net immune status. Physicians can use this assay to determine if their patients are over or under immunosuppressed and can better tailor patient care by taking the results into consideration with all other clinical factors. The demand for such a diagnostic has been intense since studies have shown that about 40% to 70% of all post transplant mortality is attributed to immunosuppression or immunosuppressants. And keep in mind, there are about 115,000 organ transplants performed each year. Early data was published late last year in the journal -- Journal of Transplantation and the authors concluded that QuantiFERON Monitor can distinguish between immunosuppressed populations, healthy controls and may provide an important advance in the management of patients after transplantation. Clinical studies are now underway in heart, lung and kidney organ transplant patients, along with pharmacokinetic and health economic assessments. This assay is also being investigated for use in other types of patients where immune status could be relevant, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, those who are HIV-positive or being treated with immuno oncology drugs. The QuantiFERON portfolio is a natural match to our artus portfolio of assays for use on the QIAsymphony family of automation platforms. This provides laboratories and their customers with the broadest range of diagnostic solutions for use in transplant patients and we're working on a number of assays to expand the menu further. I'm now on Slide 13 and will discuss the acquisition of the Enzyme Solutions Unit of Enzymatics, which has provided access to the premier supplier of enzymes used in next-generation sequencing and other genetic analysis technologies. The unique technology and capability portfolio that the Enzymatics transaction brings to QIAGEN is that the products from Enzymatics have been essential in driving the wider dissemination of next-generation sequencing and are estimated to be used to more than 80% of all next-generation sequencing reactions globally. Also, the power of their technology is so advanced and robust that they not only excel in performance in the most advanced labs, but even are cost leaders in the market, for instance in China. These enzyme solutions are a perfect fit with our expanding offering of universal next-generation sequencing products and will also support our strategy to develop integrated workflows that will help drive the adoption of next-generation sequencing in clinical health care. We are now creating a center of excellence for enzymology at the Enzymatics site in the Boston area, and about 50 of these employees, including cofounder, Chris Benoit, joined QIAGEN. Enzymatics will continue to offer an OEM business model for customers and where we have a lot of experience, but we will also consider other sales channels as well, including direct sales through QIAGEN. Another interesting aspect of this deal is that we have gained rights to next-generation sequencing products based on the ArcherDX AMP chemistry, which is considered a highly promising way to enable the detection of gene fusions and other targets that are critical for personalized healthcare and oncology. The collaboration with the new ArcherDX, which is formed after the spin out of the Enzymatics Solutions product portfolio, we will be working together to develop this technology for use on various sequencers, including the QIAGEN GeneReader and leveraging the benefits of our bioinformatics portfolio. Moving to Slide 14. Today, we're also announcing the appointments of 2 dynamic leaders to QIAGEN. First, Dr. James, or Jay Bradner, has been selected to join the Supervisory Board as a new member in January. Jay is a visionary, key opinion leader, who has played a key role in redefining drug discovery and development. He brings a wealth of experience in drug discovery and development, translational medicine and also the commercialization of innovative therapies as a founder of various biotechnology companies. He currently serves as the Associate Director of the Center of the Science and -- of Therapeutics at the Broad Institute and is also an Attending Physician at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and an Associate Professor at Harvard Medical School. We're proud to have Jay joining our board since he offers a truly unique combination of being a physician, a scientist and an entrepreneur, and all this with an extremely successful track record. Moving to Slide 15. In the second leadership change, we have -- we are announcing that Thierry Bernard has joined QIAGEN to lead our Molecular Diagnostics business area and expand our global presence in health care. Many of you already know Thierry. He brings a broad portfolio of highly relevant experience to QIAGEN, along with a great passion for our vision as well as the experience of living and working in the United States, Europe and Asia. Thierry joins us from bioMrieux, where he was most recently a Corporate Vice President and responsible for global commercial operations, investor relations and also their China operations. We see this as another signal of the interest among international executives wanting to contribute to our success. Thierry succeeds Helga Lubenow, who has decided to take parental leave. I would like to thank Helga for her contributions so far during her career at QIAGEN and wish her all the best during this parental leave. With that, I would like to hand back to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. I'm now on Slide 16 to provide some comments on our guidance for 2015 and also for the first quarter. As we mentioned on the call for our third quarter results in October, we're expecting sales growth in 2015 of about 4% at constant exchange rates. This is based on generating about 7 to 8 percentage points of constant exchange rate growth from our core portfolio, which represented about 95% of sales in 2014, against the final year of significant headwinds from our U.S. HPV products. We have taken a conservative view with our expectations for about 3 to 4 percentage points of headwinds for the year. For adjusted EPS, we are expecting about $1.16 to $1.18 per share on a full year basis at constant exchange rates. These expectations take into account that we announced earlier in January about Enzymatics acquisitions, and that is for about $20 million of incremental sales in 2015. The adjusted EPS guidance also takes a largely neutral view on the 2024 notes repurchase impact since there are some onetime tax charges, but accretion benefits are expected in 2016. Moving to Slide 17. Here, you see an overview of our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. As I just mentioned, our guidance is for adjusted net sales to rise about 4% at constant exchange rates for the year. And this takes into account our views on the final year of U.S. HPV headwinds, which will be more pronounced in the first half of 2015 than in the second half. For the first quarter, our guidance is for about 2% constant exchange rate growth and this takes into account about 7 to 8 percentage points of constant exchange rate growth from our portfolio against about 5 to 6 percentage points of U.S. HPV headwind. In terms of adjusted EPS, our guidance is for $0.22 to $0.23 per share, also at constant exchange rates. In terms of the currency impact, as you have heard from other companies, the headwinds have increased quite substantially since we last spoke with you in October, and based on current rates, we expect this to create headwinds in 2015. To give you an idea of the potential impact on results for the first quarter, and I want to stress this is based on if rates were to remain where they are today, our sales growth rate would decrease by about 7 percentage points. So given our guidance for about 2% total constant exchange rate growth in the quarter, that would mean a reported 5% decline. As for the current related -- currency-related impact on adjusted EPS, we see this at about $0.01 for the first quarter. The currency impact goes far beyond the dollar-euro rate, through a constellation of currency movements, and in particular, among currencies where we have growing sales but relatively low cost basis. As we said before, these currencies are the Swiss franc, Nordic region currencies, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira. We are not providing more details on the cost basis in these currencies, but we have said before that we have a cost overhang in euros, meaning that the weakening of the euro against the dollar and other currencies delivers benefits on the cost side. This slide also contains the adjustment assumptions for the year and the first quarter, and they are similar to levels you saw in 2014. With that, I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer M. Schatz Yes, thank you, Roland. I'm now on Slide 18 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. So let me review what we have announced. First, we delivered a solid performance in 2014, moving ahead on initiatives to accelerate innovation and growth with adjusted net sales of 9% on a constant exchange rate basis when excluding headwinds from the U.S. HPV franchise. Adjusted EPS was impacted by the restructuring charge, which was mainly noncash, while we had a nice increase in free cash flow. Second, we made a lot of progress in 2014 towards transforming on the QIAGEN portfolio. The benefits of these efforts will become more apparent through the course of 2015 as -- also, as we work through the final year of U.S. HPV headwinds and deliver above-market growth from the core portfolio. Third, our guidance is for higher adjusted net sales and EPS at constant exchange rates. And as a last point, we will continue our approach to disciplined capital allocation with a combination of targeted acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio and share repurchases. With that, I'd like to hand back to the operator to open the Q&A session. Thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Patrick Wright [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of that Dan Leonard of Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Question for Roland. Roland, I know there's a lot of moving pieces in 2015 with foreign currency. But I'm trying to determine what is your underlying EBIT expansion assumption in the 2015 guidance. And what are the sources of the expansion? Roland Sackers Excellent question. So for -- also for 2015, we feel quite comfortable that we're able to expand our overall adjusted EBIT margin by roughly 100 basis points, excluding currency. We do believe that, as you just said, currency gives us at least a certain headwind so that might be somewhere, again using more or less today's rate, 30 to 40 basis points headwind. So it still leaves us still with a quite significant net improvement potential here. And again, it's our assumption, what we have delivered in 2014. So we feel quite comfortable, as clearly, the efficiency programs we finalized over the course of '13 and '14 are gaining traction. So most of the impact comes out of SG&A, to a certain extent on the R&D side, as some of the larger programs we are able -- we will be able to finalize over the course of '15. So all in, I guess, that gives us, as I said, net 60 to 70 basis points for adjusted EBIT. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Wondering, maybe Peer, if you can put some parameters around kind of the market opportunity and your view around  to the growth drivers, in particular. Liquid biopsy, obviously, you had progress with ERISA out of the gate, but talk to how big you think this market opportunity is and what may be that could contribute in '15. And then similarly, with the QuantiFERON Monitor, you talked about $100 million market but obviously potential to expand that. What's the time frame to move beyond the initial focus on transplant? Peer M. Schatz Tycho, the first, the -- well, start with the second one first. The QuantiFERON Monitor is going to first be positioned in the transplant market, which is a big market that we're already very well-positioned in, and that is also shown on this -- on the slide that we showed. We have a very strong franchise in transplantation testing, which was further reaffirmed by the 510(k) we got in HSV, which in addition to CMV which has a PMA and HSV now added as a 510(k), we have the other assays as ASRs available or moving to the pipeline. And with QuantiFERON Monitor, the QuantiFERON CMV assay, which is already available in Europe and QuantiFERON TB, which is also used in transplantation, we have a very, very interesting portfolio there. So we think that transplantation market, which overall is maybe $100 million in size, is a very good starting point for QuantiFERON Monitor. But as we now are further validating in some programs, also together with pharma companies, things like the use of this QuantiFERON Monitor assay as a companion diagnostic with immuno oncology drugs, PD-1, PD-L1 portfolio, there's a really interesting opportunity there because we can assess appropriate dosage of these drugs, which is obviously extremely important in immuno oncology and other areas. But this still is in validation mode so we wouldn't want to put a timing behind it at this point. But over the course of '15, you'll definitely get a lot more news flow in that regard. In terms of the liquid biopsy portfolio, there are a number of different terms floating around in the market what this actually is. There 2 ways of describing it. One is the use of liquid biopsy as a sample, the sample technologies. And this is an area that we've been in since 10 years ago. If you read the first papers that were done by the pioneers in this area, they were all -- already applying our technology to process the samples. And if you read and hear about all of these new approaches to liquid biopsy, and everybody's kind of diving into this area at the moment, there -- almost all of them applying our front-end sample technologies because this allows access to this very rare amount of new circulating nucleic acid that can be assayed. The assays are the majority part of the market in terms of size, however, and they obviously are now opening up new potentials in terms of testing because we can do more routine monitoring. The nice thing about liquid biopsy is that we can access sample types that were previously not accessible, and we can do, thereby also monitoring. So therapeutic monitoring, recurrence monitoring and potentially even screening. And this is still at a very early stage. So we are present in almost all of these programs. We, ourselves, are looking at primarily now companion diagnostics, both in PCR and next-gen sequencing. Just to remind you, the next-gen sequencing panels we have, they're already all liquid biopsy-ready, meaning that other than with other panel technologies, we can process FFPE and liquid biopsy in the same workflow, and this makes it extremely easy to use, as sometimes biopsies are used -- sometimes liquid biopsies are used. And we see this as the beginning of a very important trend, but it's not going to open up immediately. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on guidelines relating to TB testing with the World Health Organization. And then whether you had any reason to believe that the blood-based test could take more meaningful share from the skin test, if you saw greater adoption there. Peer M. Schatz Absolutely there -- the guidelines are changing around the world, and we definitely saw a number of new guideline changes in a number of different segments also in the United States, all calling for a more stringent, more structured latent TB testing process. And there, our product really excels because one of the biggest issues with latent TB is that the old skin test requires multiple visits and has a lot of false positives, especially also due to vaccinated populations being picked up as positives. And so the simplicity of our product and the lowering of the administration cost leads to very substantial savings to the health care system and also to systems like the correctional facilities, immigration and others. So we see that the benefits that we've been able to create with the latent TB product, the QuantiFERON Gold product, have been right on spot in terms of now everything the guidelines are calling for. And we think that the new products, and this is actually a very substantial new product that we launched, the TB Gold Plus product, has the ability to also now differentiate between risk of progression to active TB. And this is still in validation mode, but we're working very actively on it. So there are a lot of new features in this new product that up and beyond the current usage could provide new applications as well. We remain enthusiastic about the opportunity, and all of the guideline changes are moving in the right direction for us. I'd just also like to highlight the WHO guidelines for use of these -- of latent TB testing in even higher-prevalence countries and risk populations. And this is just massive in terms of increasing the total available market. We always talk about 50 million to 60 million tests. We believe that alone added a double-digit million dollar of total available market in terms of tests to that. And we're obviously working very hard to be able to translate that into numbers. So growth trajectory for many years to come, we see very positive on this product portfolio. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg Bank. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division I have a few financial questions, please. Mainly just focusing initially on cash flow development. I think a couple of years ago at your Capital Markets Day, you outlined an ambition to double your operating cash flow in the midterm. And really, the question just relates to why operating cash flow hasn't grown as rapidly as your reported net income, given actually last year, you had a lot of cash restructuring cost, lesser than this year. So just a little bit of clarification around that. And if possible, a operating cash flow guidance for 2015 would be very helpful. Roland Sackers Yes, Scott. In terms for 2015, we clearly do believe that we should be able to increase both of the -- compared to, both meaning free cash flow as well as operating cash flow faster than the net income, driven by the benefits out of our efficiency programs. And if you look into 2014, again, you could see that we were able to raise free cash flow to actually a record USD 201 million for the full year. This also includes, as we just said as well, certain payouts from restructuring accruals. So again, there are clearly certain things in which shouldn't be in, especially in '15 and beyond. Probably more important also, there is a certain swing now actually more from the fourth quarter in 2014 into the first quarter 2015, driven by certain hedging in derivatives we did. So again, I would say that Q4 cash flow is actually underrepresented, where probably Q1 2015 cash flow will be slightly overrepresented. At the end of the day, we feel on track with being able to, as we said before, doubling our operating cash flow in the course of 3 to 4 years. The 15% we have seen in '15 gives us here actually a good jump start. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI, Research Division Peer, maybe I had a different take on your instrument versus consumables. Fairly strong uptake in your instrument placements, double-digits, right? And I guess my question is what percentage of those are incremental new placements versus replacing existing systems? I guess because the read-through is at some point, that has to translate into a stronger consumable growth. And so I guess how should we sort of model our consumable growth, just given the strong instrument placements that you had this year? Peer M. Schatz So indeed, the instrument placements are leading to very strong growth in consumables, high double-digit growth in consumables in accounts where we place a system. The -- by far, the majority of these placements are with new accounts. We only have few of the systems that are replacing older systems. Remember, the QIAsymphony is basically a clinical sample to insight solution and integrates with real-time PCR next-generation sequencing. A big chunk is actually doing next-gen sequencing also on the downstream as well. So we're really placing into a lot of virgin territory and are not seeing a lot of replacement demand. It's tough to estimate this because the systems are rarely retired at this stage. They're very long lifespans that they can work on. Some of our instruments have been running for 20 years or so. But I would estimate that at least 85% are new placements and 15% are recurring. The installed base is clearly moving up on the Symphony side, but also products like QIAcube, where we have more than double-digit thousand systems out there, and we have very large -- these are products that by far the most of them are currently being sold as new placements or additional placements and rarely retiring old systems. So we're still in an early phase of the instrument rollout, as we said. And in the U.S., it really just started because the menu has been starting to come together, and I showed you transplant is really, since January now, we have the critical mass together, and we can rollout a very interesting portfolio into that attractive market. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Peer, maybe we can just continue in the kind of theme there on the QIAsymphony a little. Can you update us on utilization and where that stands now that you've launched a number of assays in the U.S.? So can you give us kind of where things stand in the U.S. but also in the kind of an update on utilization o U.S.? Peer M. Schatz Right. Sure, so 2014 was definitely a year of migration where we had the C. diff assay, which is obviously a very low-hanging fruit assay, pushed the whole system through an FDA clearance about 9 months ago. The portfolio obviously is not complete with one assay. And we have other assays in the pipeline, the whole HAI portfolio and the Women's Health portfolio as well -- the transplant portfolio, I mean. So there's -- the transplant portfolio has now been coming together. We got the PMA on CMV. We got the 510(k) on HSV, and those are the bigger volume assays and the rest we have available as ASRs. And the -- so there, we're starting to see now the portfolio come together nicely. The 2015 submissions will include the QuantiFERON Monitor, which we think is truly novel and a completely new message to transplantation experts and potentially also the CMV monitor assay, which we think is very novel but a smaller opportunity. So the transplant were coming together nicely, which means that we can move into this $100 million market quite aggressively. On HAI, we are in the process of working through these submissions and the clin trials, and so we'll see a string of announcements in '15 around that. For each of these -- once we have the critical mass in the menu, the markets open up, and this is just now starting to happen. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So, Peer, can you just give us -- I jumped on the call late, so my apologies if you addressed this already, but your Informatics business, how big is that sort of exiting 2014? And could you just give us some idea on what is sort of embedded into your growth expectations on that business for '15? And I guess my question is like what is sort of additional things you're doing to sort of expand that? And I've got a follow-up to that. Peer M. Schatz Sure. So our bioinformatics franchise is uniquely focused on everything that is extremely close to the biology. So we would not enter into markets that we think are potentially better served by large IT companies or others. But this biology proximity is an area that is growing quite rapidly, and we have today a revenue base, which is 3%, 4% of our sales base. We have a very strong double-digit growth expectation in that area for '15, '16. The trajectory is certainly attractive on the stand-alone basis, but it's obviously a smaller part of our business. The key thing is that we are seeing everything that we do across the company having some sort of a smart angle, as we see the industry is moving from selling cell phones to smart phones where we are trying to integrate this intelligence into even the most standard products that we sell and trying to link them up to the intelligence that we can help create through the bioinformatics franchises that we have. So you're going to see a lot of that become a lot more evident over the course of 2015. So the business itself is a very good trajectory. It's been a very attractive value creative for us going forward, but at the same time, it has an impact across our organization. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Barak Khurshid (sic) [Zarak Khurshid] of Wedbush Securities. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division So I guess first, for the codevelopment payments, how should we be thinking about the pacing of those and the magnitude and call it organic growth, say '15 and beyond? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So if you look at our Personalized Healthcare franchise, which we scoped at a little bit over $100 million in sales or over $100 million in sales, the codevelopment payments, they're a fluctuating percentage, but the more important part of the value that we generate here comes from kit sales, and that is obviously attractive area for us. And many of these companion diagnostic and cancer kits are growing at very, very solid double-digit growth rates. The payments we're getting from pharmaceutical companies, we typically have a large number that is being committed to by pharmaceutical companies. We assume a certain attrition number and that is what we then ultimately put into our base for the year 2015 and also resource against. And the number can increase, but very frankly, we're less focused on the growth in that area. We're more focused on making sure that we have the highest possible number of kits actually making it over the finish line. So a lot of our time is actually spent in evaluating pharmaceutical companion diagnostic opportunities as to their likelihood of actually achieving success in creating a sizable market opportunity for kits. And this -- so we would rather turn down a program than take one on board and potentially crowd out something more interesting just to get a short term maybe revenue gain through higher codevelopment payments. So I wouldn't assume big growth on that percentage. We said a couple of years ago it's about 1/3 of the portfolio that just assume that it's not a dramatically changing number going forward to have a steady increase of the menu is going to, by itself, lead to a significant growth on the kit sales like we're already experiencing. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Dan Areith (sic) [Dan Arias] of Citigroup. Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Peer, on the HPV business, it sounds like you expect the revenue headwind to progressively decline over the course of the year. Is that just based on comps and the fact that the percentage of total sales is going to go down? Or is there a specific pricing or account element that you expect to play a role there? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So HPV was about 4% -- U.S. HPV was about 4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. And by the way, this is why you see -- if we now assume that there's continued headwind, you see that by the end of '15, this should probably not be a meaningful impact anymore. This is why we expect that the headwinds dissipate and the underlying leading organic growth that we are currently experiencing will shine through. The majority of this is actually pricing, and we're basically rolling over contracts into these new prices as the contracts expire. We're actually very successful in being able to roll them over, but prices have come down, as we all know, from about $20 that we had about 4, 5 years ago on average to where they are today in the single digits. And this simply had to do with irrational pricing behavior by some entrants. So we're following that. We are helping our customers also transition and being able to justify this type of testing, but it clearly came at the expense of revenue. These contracts are starting to -- the rollover is now starting to near completion, and this is what we hope to happen at the end of '15, and we're not far away from that though. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division I have a question regarding your bioinformatics product offering. Can you potentially put that into a competitive perspective, how big is your next competitor? And if -- how complete is your offering basically versus your competition? And where do you still see gaps? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Daniel. This is -- so the portfolio that we have today is the industry-leading portfolio in interpretation. So I think we can say in all fairness that in interpreting PCR next-generation sequencing data, we're really second to none. And this shows by the market shares and the sizes that we have. We are, many times, even a lot larger than the #2 in this space, and in terms of quality, we believe far ahead. This has been a 15-year effort with massive resources, and the result is just starting to show its true value. So there's a clear industry-leading position that we're now putting into a very strong reporting capability. So the ability to create really slick, really simple reports for pathologists and even physicians is well underway. And we've already demoed it to some people, have seen it already, and this, we think, will be a great and exciting 2015 launch. The second is on the secondary analysis, meaning, take the data -- taking the data off the sequence and putting it into, I'm calling, the variance. There, we have a very strong offering in the commercial arena. Also here, several times larger than the #2 in the market with the CLC branded product portfolio. This has been an undisputed leader in next-generation sequencing. We have now ported it over to clinical uses. The cancer research workbench, for instance, is an intermediary step in that direction. And we've now integrated also the BIOBASE portfolio into that workbench. And some of you might've seen that this is incredibly slick. If you look at how we can actually take data off sequencers and seamlessly move them through with just a few buttons to be pushed into a report that can be used by physicians, by pathologists. This is incredible. Today's systems require an extensive training in bioinformatics, and this is just not going to help democratization, especially in clinical research and diagnosis, and that's where we have a good offering. So we have a good and complete offering in this space, along that pipe, but we're continuing to expand it incrementally. For us, the key thing is, again, we will not go into areas that we think are better served by big data companies. There a lot of areas of bioinformatics that we think other companies can serve at least as well, and those are less attractive for us. But we're going to stay very close to the biology and very close to the wet lab features of it. And that -- that's where our core domain is and the rest of the areas we partner. As you know, we have a strong partnership with IBM and with other companies in this area, and we'll continue to expand these relationships with them and others. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I guess 3 clean up questions. First, on the pharmaceutical end market. Your growth's been improving the last few quarters, but relative to some other life science tools providers, it's been a little bit late relatively speaking. Just wondering if you'd be willing to talk about why you think that might be. My second question is also on pharmaceuticals. Did you see a spike in pharmaceutical milestone payments in Q4, given some of the companion diagnostic announcements you made towards the end of the quarter? And my third question is on HPV. Given if we kind of look at the pacing over the course of 2014, you went from about $30 million in U.S. HPV revenue in Q1, down to something that was probably between $10 million to $15 million in Q4. I know you talked about pricing, but it seems like when you see this type of drop in a market where the competitors have been there for little bit, that there's probably some contracts that are rolling off. Is the assumption that there's more of those rolling off next year? And should we model it accordingly? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Doug, I'll take 1 in 3 and Roland can take 2. So the first on the pharma side. Pharma is a very different or is very diverse group of customers. We've seen a good uptick in some regions. We've seen very poor performance in others. And it really depends on where larger projects are being done, especially in clinical development. So it's much more lumpy than, for instance, Academia. And I wouldn't interpret too much into a quarter-over-quarter, sequential quarter performance. Look at this more in annual performance where there are improving trends. What I would say is that on the Pharma side, we're not super satisfied in how we've been able to address that market, and that's something that we're addressing for 2015, has to do with the way that our commercial engine was set up, and we are looking at this in a new way. So this is something where we think we can improve further on this. But again, the sequential performance, I wouldn't put too much interpretation into it. The second thing is on the HPV side. The contracts are simply rolling over and then they're renewed at new prices, and that will continue over the course of 2015, as the guidance already implicates. Our underlying growth rate is in the high single digits, and we're seeing the headwind, and we will also see that over the course -- in particular, over the first 3 quarters of this year. But we expect, based on how contracts are structured and what still is up for renewal, that we will see the majority of that having rolled out by the end of the year. Again going from 4% of sales in Q4 2014, this -- you'll see where this will potentially end up. So we're already assuming a rather aggressive continuation of this trend into a number that will not impact us anymore going forward, thereafter. And that, again, will be sometime the second half of the year. Roland Sackers And on your question around -- results of companion diagnostic, as we said before, we particularly had a very strong fourth quarter. Please have in mind that we do report that within our MDx numbers and the growth rate ex HPV for MDx was 16%, excluding currency impact in the fourth quarter. So again, also very strong performance. It's driven actually by both, a good kit sales performance. We see improving trends not only in U.S. but also globally. At the same time, with the number of new contracts we've been able to close, we had a good finish in the fourth quarter, clearly also one of the driver for 2015 as well. Patrick Wright And our last question for today comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Quick follow-up for Roland and then a question for Peer. Roland, on the operating margin expansion commentary from earlier, were you adjusting for the fourth quarter charges in the year-over-year improvement? And then... Roland Sackers Yes, absolutely. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Peer, a question on the appetite for M&A. Are there specific areas you're looking for with a net leverage at 1.5 turns, it's pretty low. I guess, what -- how big could you go in other areas that you're interested in? Roland Sackers Before you answer question, just to make it very clear, so I was more or less commentating on adjusted balances also for 2014. So my basis was 25.1% for 2014. Peer M. Schatz Great. Yes, so I think there's a theoretical question, Jeff. And answer to that question, which we all can calculate with a theoretical fire power, is the company's extremely well-financed, has a strong balance sheet, and we are obviously reallocating capital to our shareholders quite aggressively as you see. You saw the bond repurchase and the share repurchase last year. And that said, we are aggressively also looking at acquisition opportunities in an environment like this, and we see a lot of opportunities, especially for a company our size where a lot of entities are attractive even to a certain degree needle-moving transactions on our scale, but less so for larger entities. So we have been quite successful. You saw the Enzymatics transaction. We're very excited about that. We're very excited about BIOBASE. So we've been very selective. And if you look at the last 3, 4 years, we are very pleased with the performance of that track record. It added a phenomenal asset base and also value creation in the meantime to our entity, and we expect that to continue. And by the way, this value creation was across Life Sciences and Diagnostics. So the capital allocation has been very balanced, and we look at opportunities and not simply at market segments. John Gilardi So with that, I'd like to close the conference call.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Patrick Wright [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of that Dan Leonard of Leerink. Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division Question for Roland. Roland, I know there's a lot of moving pieces in 2015 with foreign currency. But I'm trying to determine what is your underlying EBIT expansion assumption in the 2015 guidance. And what are the sources of the expansion? Roland Sackers Excellent question. So for -- also for 2015, we feel quite comfortable that we're able to expand our overall adjusted EBIT margin by roughly 100 basis points, excluding currency. We do believe that, as you just said, currency gives us at least a certain headwind so that might be somewhere, again using more or less today's rate, 30 to 40 basis points headwind. So it still leaves us still with a quite significant net improvement potential here. And again, it's our assumption, what we have delivered in 2014. So we feel quite comfortable, as clearly, the efficiency programs we finalized over the course of '13 and '14 are gaining traction. So most of the impact comes out of SG&A, to a certain extent on the R&D side, as some of the larger programs we are able -- we will be able to finalize over the course of '15. So all in, I guess, that gives us, as I said, net 60 to 70 basis points for adjusted EBIT. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division Wondering, maybe Peer, if you can put some parameters around kind of the market opportunity and your view around  to the growth drivers, in particular. Liquid biopsy, obviously, you had progress with ERISA out of the gate, but talk to how big you think this market opportunity is and what may be that could contribute in '15. And then similarly, with the QuantiFERON Monitor, you talked about $100 million market but obviously potential to expand that. What's the time frame to move beyond the initial focus on transplant? Peer M. Schatz Tycho, the first, the -- well, start with the second one first. The QuantiFERON Monitor is going to first be positioned in the transplant market, which is a big market that we're already very well-positioned in, and that is also shown on this -- on the slide that we showed. We have a very strong franchise in transplantation testing, which was further reaffirmed by the 510(k) we got in HSV, which in addition to CMV which has a PMA and HSV now added as a 510(k), we have the other assays as ASRs available or moving to the pipeline. And with QuantiFERON Monitor, the QuantiFERON CMV assay, which is already available in Europe and QuantiFERON TB, which is also used in transplantation, we have a very, very interesting portfolio there. So we think that transplantation market, which overall is maybe $100 million in size, is a very good starting point for QuantiFERON Monitor. But as we now are further validating in some programs, also together with pharma companies, things like the use of this QuantiFERON Monitor assay as a companion diagnostic with immuno oncology drugs, PD-1, PD-L1 portfolio, there's a really interesting opportunity there because we can assess appropriate dosage of these drugs, which is obviously extremely important in immuno oncology and other areas. But this still is in validation mode so we wouldn't want to put a timing behind it at this point. But over the course of '15, you'll definitely get a lot more news flow in that regard. In terms of the liquid biopsy portfolio, there are a number of different terms floating around in the market what this actually is. There 2 ways of describing it. One is the use of liquid biopsy as a sample, the sample technologies. And this is an area that we've been in since 10 years ago. If you read the first papers that were done by the pioneers in this area, they were all -- already applying our technology to process the samples. And if you read and hear about all of these new approaches to liquid biopsy, and everybody's kind of diving into this area at the moment, there -- almost all of them applying our front-end sample technologies because this allows access to this very rare amount of new circulating nucleic acid that can be assayed. The assays are the majority part of the market in terms of size, however, and they obviously are now opening up new potentials in terms of testing because we can do more routine monitoring. The nice thing about liquid biopsy is that we can access sample types that were previously not accessible, and we can do, thereby also monitoring. So therapeutic monitoring, recurrence monitoring and potentially even screening. And this is still at a very early stage. So we are present in almost all of these programs. We, ourselves, are looking at primarily now companion diagnostics, both in PCR and next-gen sequencing. Just to remind you, the next-gen sequencing panels we have, they're already all liquid biopsy-ready, meaning that other than with other panel technologies, we can process FFPE and liquid biopsy in the same workflow, and this makes it extremely easy to use, as sometimes biopsies are used -- sometimes liquid biopsies are used. And we see this as the beginning of a very important trend, but it's not going to open up immediately. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Research Division I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on guidelines relating to TB testing with the World Health Organization. And then whether you had any reason to believe that the blood-based test could take more meaningful share from the skin test, if you saw greater adoption there. Peer M. Schatz Absolutely there -- the guidelines are changing around the world, and we definitely saw a number of new guideline changes in a number of different segments also in the United States, all calling for a more stringent, more structured latent TB testing process. And there, our product really excels because one of the biggest issues with latent TB is that the old skin test requires multiple visits and has a lot of false positives, especially also due to vaccinated populations being picked up as positives. And so the simplicity of our product and the lowering of the administration cost leads to very substantial savings to the health care system and also to systems like the correctional facilities, immigration and others. So we see that the benefits that we've been able to create with the latent TB product, the QuantiFERON Gold product, have been right on spot in terms of now everything the guidelines are calling for. And we think that the new products, and this is actually a very substantial new product that we launched, the TB Gold Plus product, has the ability to also now differentiate between risk of progression to active TB. And this is still in validation mode, but we're working very actively on it. So there are a lot of new features in this new product that up and beyond the current usage could provide new applications as well. We remain enthusiastic about the opportunity, and all of the guideline changes are moving in the right direction for us. I'd just also like to highlight the WHO guidelines for use of these -- of latent TB testing in even higher-prevalence countries and risk populations. And this is just massive in terms of increasing the total available market. We always talk about 50 million to 60 million tests. We believe that alone added a double-digit million dollar of total available market in terms of tests to that. And we're obviously working very hard to be able to translate that into numbers. So growth trajectory for many years to come, we see very positive on this product portfolio. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg Bank. Scott Bardo - Berenberg, Research Division I have a few financial questions, please. Mainly just focusing initially on cash flow development. I think a couple of years ago at your Capital Markets Day, you outlined an ambition to double your operating cash flow in the midterm. And really, the question just relates to why operating cash flow hasn't grown as rapidly as your reported net income, given actually last year, you had a lot of cash restructuring cost, lesser than this year. So just a little bit of clarification around that. And if possible, a operating cash flow guidance for 2015 would be very helpful. Roland Sackers Yes, Scott. In terms for 2015, we clearly do believe that we should be able to increase both of the -- compared to, both meaning free cash flow as well as operating cash flow faster than the net income, driven by the benefits out of our efficiency programs. And if you look into 2014, again, you could see that we were able to raise free cash flow to actually a record USD 201 million for the full year. This also includes, as we just said as well, certain payouts from restructuring accruals. So again, there are clearly certain things in which shouldn't be in, especially in '15 and beyond. Probably more important also, there is a certain swing now actually more from the fourth quarter in 2014 into the first quarter 2015, driven by certain hedging in derivatives we did. So again, I would say that Q4 cash flow is actually underrepresented, where probably Q1 2015 cash flow will be slightly overrepresented. At the end of the day, we feel on track with being able to, as we said before, doubling our operating cash flow in the course of 3 to 4 years. The 15% we have seen in '15 gives us here actually a good jump start. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Vijay Kumar of Evercore ISI. Vijay Kumar - Evercore ISI, Research Division Peer, maybe I had a different take on your instrument versus consumables. Fairly strong uptake in your instrument placements, double-digits, right? And I guess my question is what percentage of those are incremental new placements versus replacing existing systems? I guess because the read-through is at some point, that has to translate into a stronger consumable growth. And so I guess how should we sort of model our consumable growth, just given the strong instrument placements that you had this year? Peer M. Schatz So indeed, the instrument placements are leading to very strong growth in consumables, high double-digit growth in consumables in accounts where we place a system. The -- by far, the majority of these placements are with new accounts. We only have few of the systems that are replacing older systems. Remember, the QIAsymphony is basically a clinical sample to insight solution and integrates with real-time PCR next-generation sequencing. A big chunk is actually doing next-gen sequencing also on the downstream as well. So we're really placing into a lot of virgin territory and are not seeing a lot of replacement demand. It's tough to estimate this because the systems are rarely retired at this stage. They're very long lifespans that they can work on. Some of our instruments have been running for 20 years or so. But I would estimate that at least 85% are new placements and 15% are recurring. The installed base is clearly moving up on the Symphony side, but also products like QIAcube, where we have more than double-digit thousand systems out there, and we have very large -- these are products that by far the most of them are currently being sold as new placements or additional placements and rarely retiring old systems. So we're still in an early phase of the instrument rollout, as we said. And in the U.S., it really just started because the menu has been starting to come together, and I showed you transplant is really, since January now, we have the critical mass together, and we can rollout a very interesting portfolio into that attractive market. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein of William Blair. Brian Weinstein - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division Peer, maybe we can just continue in the kind of theme there on the QIAsymphony a little. Can you update us on utilization and where that stands now that you've launched a number of assays in the U.S.? So can you give us kind of where things stand in the U.S. but also in the kind of an update on utilization o U.S.? Peer M. Schatz Right. Sure, so 2014 was definitely a year of migration where we had the C. diff assay, which is obviously a very low-hanging fruit assay, pushed the whole system through an FDA clearance about 9 months ago. The portfolio obviously is not complete with one assay. And we have other assays in the pipeline, the whole HAI portfolio and the Women's Health portfolio as well -- the transplant portfolio, I mean. So there's -- the transplant portfolio has now been coming together. We got the PMA on CMV. We got the 510(k) on HSV, and those are the bigger volume assays and the rest we have available as ASRs. And the -- so there, we're starting to see now the portfolio come together nicely. The 2015 submissions will include the QuantiFERON Monitor, which we think is truly novel and a completely new message to transplantation experts and potentially also the CMV monitor assay, which we think is very novel but a smaller opportunity. So the transplant were coming together nicely, which means that we can move into this $100 million market quite aggressively. On HAI, we are in the process of working through these submissions and the clin trials, and so we'll see a string of announcements in '15 around that. For each of these -- once we have the critical mass in the menu, the markets open up, and this is just now starting to happen. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division So, Peer, can you just give us -- I jumped on the call late, so my apologies if you addressed this already, but your Informatics business, how big is that sort of exiting 2014? And could you just give us some idea on what is sort of embedded into your growth expectations on that business for '15? And I guess my question is like what is sort of additional things you're doing to sort of expand that? And I've got a follow-up to that. Peer M. Schatz Sure. So our bioinformatics franchise is uniquely focused on everything that is extremely close to the biology. So we would not enter into markets that we think are potentially better served by large IT companies or others. But this biology proximity is an area that is growing quite rapidly, and we have today a revenue base, which is 3%, 4% of our sales base. We have a very strong double-digit growth expectation in that area for '15, '16. The trajectory is certainly attractive on the stand-alone basis, but it's obviously a smaller part of our business. The key thing is that we are seeing everything that we do across the company having some sort of a smart angle, as we see the industry is moving from selling cell phones to smart phones where we are trying to integrate this intelligence into even the most standard products that we sell and trying to link them up to the intelligence that we can help create through the bioinformatics franchises that we have. So you're going to see a lot of that become a lot more evident over the course of 2015. So the business itself is a very good trajectory. It's been a very attractive value creative for us going forward, but at the same time, it has an impact across our organization. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Barak Khurshid (sic) [Zarak Khurshid] of Wedbush Securities. Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division So I guess first, for the codevelopment payments, how should we be thinking about the pacing of those and the magnitude and call it organic growth, say '15 and beyond? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So if you look at our Personalized Healthcare franchise, which we scoped at a little bit over $100 million in sales or over $100 million in sales, the codevelopment payments, they're a fluctuating percentage, but the more important part of the value that we generate here comes from kit sales, and that is obviously attractive area for us. And many of these companion diagnostic and cancer kits are growing at very, very solid double-digit growth rates. The payments we're getting from pharmaceutical companies, we typically have a large number that is being committed to by pharmaceutical companies. We assume a certain attrition number and that is what we then ultimately put into our base for the year 2015 and also resource against. And the number can increase, but very frankly, we're less focused on the growth in that area. We're more focused on making sure that we have the highest possible number of kits actually making it over the finish line. So a lot of our time is actually spent in evaluating pharmaceutical companion diagnostic opportunities as to their likelihood of actually achieving success in creating a sizable market opportunity for kits. And this -- so we would rather turn down a program than take one on board and potentially crowd out something more interesting just to get a short term maybe revenue gain through higher codevelopment payments. So I wouldn't assume big growth on that percentage. We said a couple of years ago it's about 1/3 of the portfolio that just assume that it's not a dramatically changing number going forward to have a steady increase of the menu is going to, by itself, lead to a significant growth on the kit sales like we're already experiencing. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Dan Areith (sic) [Dan Arias] of Citigroup. Daniel Anthony Arias - Citigroup Inc, Research Division Peer, on the HPV business, it sounds like you expect the revenue headwind to progressively decline over the course of the year. Is that just based on comps and the fact that the percentage of total sales is going to go down? Or is there a specific pricing or account element that you expect to play a role there? Peer M. Schatz Sure. So HPV was about 4% -- U.S. HPV was about 4% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2015. And by the way, this is why you see -- if we now assume that there's continued headwind, you see that by the end of '15, this should probably not be a meaningful impact anymore. This is why we expect that the headwinds dissipate and the underlying leading organic growth that we are currently experiencing will shine through. The majority of this is actually pricing, and we're basically rolling over contracts into these new prices as the contracts expire. We're actually very successful in being able to roll them over, but prices have come down, as we all know, from about $20 that we had about 4, 5 years ago on average to where they are today in the single digits. And this simply had to do with irrational pricing behavior by some entrants. So we're following that. We are helping our customers also transition and being able to justify this type of testing, but it clearly came at the expense of revenue. These contracts are starting to -- the rollover is now starting to near completion, and this is what we hope to happen at the end of '15, and we're not far away from that though. Patrick Wright Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Daniel Wendorff - Commerzbank AG, Research Division I have a question regarding your bioinformatics product offering. Can you potentially put that into a competitive perspective, how big is your next competitor? And if -- how complete is your offering basically versus your competition? And where do you still see gaps? Peer M. Schatz Thanks, Daniel. This is -- so the portfolio that we have today is the industry-leading portfolio in interpretation. So I think we can say in all fairness that in interpreting PCR next-generation sequencing data, we're really second to none. And this shows by the market shares and the sizes that we have. We are, many times, even a lot larger than the #2 in this space, and in terms of quality, we believe far ahead. This has been a 15-year effort with massive resources, and the result is just starting to show its true value. So there's a clear industry-leading position that we're now putting into a very strong reporting capability. So the ability to create really slick, really simple reports for pathologists and even physicians is well underway. And we've already demoed it to some people, have seen it already, and this, we think, will be a great and exciting 2015 launch. The second is on the secondary analysis, meaning, take the data -- taking the data off the sequence and putting it into, I'm calling, the variance. There, we have a very strong offering in the commercial arena. Also here, several times larger than the #2 in the market with the CLC branded product portfolio. This has been an undisputed leader in next-generation sequencing. We have now ported it over to clinical uses. The cancer research workbench, for instance, is an intermediary step in that direction. And we've now integrated also the BIOBASE portfolio into that workbench. And some of you might've seen that this is incredibly slick. If you look at how we can actually take data off sequencers and seamlessly move them through with just a few buttons to be pushed into a report that can be used by physicians, by pathologists. This is incredible. Today's systems require an extensive training in bioinformatics, and this is just not going to help democratization, especially in clinical research and diagnosis, and that's where we have a good offering. So we have a good and complete offering in this space, along that pipe, but we're continuing to expand it incrementally. For us, the key thing is, again, we will not go into areas that we think are better served by big data companies. There a lot of areas of bioinformatics that we think other companies can serve at least as well, and those are less attractive for us. But we're going to stay very close to the biology and very close to the wet lab features of it. And that -- that's where our core domain is and the rest of the areas we partner. As you know, we have a strong partnership with IBM and with other companies in this area, and we'll continue to expand these relationships with them and others. Patrick Wright And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division I guess 3 clean up questions. First, on the pharmaceutical end market. Your growth's been improving the last few quarters, but relative to some other life science tools providers, it's been a little bit late relatively speaking. Just wondering if you'd be willing to talk about why you think that might be. My second question is also on pharmaceuticals. Did you see a spike in pharmaceutical milestone payments in Q4, given some of the companion diagnostic announcements you made towards the end of the quarter? And my third question is on HPV. Given if we kind of look at the pacing over the course of 2014, you went from about $30 million in U.S. HPV revenue in Q1, down to something that was probably between $10 million to $15 million in Q4. I know you talked about pricing, but it seems like when you see this type of drop in a market where the competitors have been there for little bit, that there's probably some contracts that are rolling off. Is the assumption that there's more of those rolling off next year? And should we model it accordingly? Peer M. Schatz Sure. Thanks, Doug, I'll take 1 in 3 and Roland can take 2. So the first on the pharma side. Pharma is a very different or is very diverse group of customers. We've seen a good uptick in some regions. We've seen very poor performance in others. And it really depends on where larger projects are being done, especially in clinical development. So it's much more lumpy than, for instance, Academia. And I wouldn't interpret too much into a quarter-over-quarter, sequential quarter performance. Look at this more in annual performance where there are improving trends. What I would say is that on the Pharma side, we're not super satisfied in how we've been able to address that market, and that's something that we're addressing for 2015, has to do with the way that our commercial engine was set up, and we are looking at this in a new way. So this is something where we think we can improve further on this. But again, the sequential performance, I wouldn't put too much interpretation into it. The second thing is on the HPV side. The contracts are simply rolling over and then they're renewed at new prices, and that will continue over the course of 2015, as the guidance already implicates. Our underlying growth rate is in the high single digits, and we're seeing the headwind, and we will also see that over the course -- in particular, over the first 3 quarters of this year. But we expect, based on how contracts are structured and what still is up for renewal, that we will see the majority of that having rolled out by the end of the year. Again going from 4% of sales in Q4 2014, this -- you'll see where this will potentially end up. So we're already assuming a rather aggressive continuation of this trend into a number that will not impact us anymore going forward, thereafter. And that, again, will be sometime the second half of the year. Roland Sackers And on your question around -- results of companion diagnostic, as we said before, we particularly had a very strong fourth quarter. Please have in mind that we do report that within our MDx numbers and the growth rate ex HPV for MDx was 16%, excluding currency impact in the fourth quarter. So again, also very strong performance. It's driven actually by both, a good kit sales performance. We see improving trends not only in U.S. but also globally. At the same time, with the number of new contracts we've been able to close, we had a good finish in the fourth quarter, clearly also one of the driver for 2015 as well. Patrick Wright And our last question for today comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert Baird. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Quick follow-up for Roland and then a question for Peer. Roland, on the operating margin expansion commentary from earlier, were you adjusting for the fourth quarter charges in the year-over-year improvement? And then... Roland Sackers Yes, absolutely. Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division Peer, a question on the appetite for M&A. Are there specific areas you're looking for with a net leverage at 1.5 turns, it's pretty low. I guess, what -- how big could you go in other areas that you're interested in? Roland Sackers Before you answer question, just to make it very clear, so I was more or less commentating on adjusted balances also for 2014. So my basis was 25.1% for 2014. Peer M. Schatz Great. Yes, so I think there's a theoretical question, Jeff. And answer to that question, which we all can calculate with a theoretical fire power, is the company's extremely well-financed, has a strong balance sheet, and we are obviously reallocating capital to our shareholders quite aggressively as you see. You saw the bond repurchase and the share repurchase last year. And that said, we are aggressively also looking at acquisition opportunities in an environment like this, and we see a lot of opportunities, especially for a company our size where a lot of entities are attractive even to a certain degree needle-moving transactions on our scale, but less so for larger entities. So we have been quite successful. You saw the Enzymatics transaction. We're very excited about that. We're very excited about BIOBASE. So we've been very selective. And if you look at the last 3, 4 years, we are very pleased with the performance of that track record. It added a phenomenal asset base and also value creation in the meantime to our entity, and we expect that to continue. And by the way, this value creation was across Life Sciences and Diagnostics. So the capital allocation has been very balanced, and we look at opportunities and not simply at market segments. John Gilardi So with that, I'd like to close the conference call. And if you have any following questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call or shoot me an e-mail. Thank you again. Patrick Wright Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Greg Maffei. Please go ahead, sir. Gregory B. Maffei Thank you, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in the newly created Liberty Media. Today speaking on the call, I\'ll have the Chrises, our newly created CFO, Chris Shean; and Starz CEO, Chris Albrecht. Also available on the call, we\'ll have several other senior Liberty and Starz executives. All of us will be available to answer questions at the end. Liberty Media was created by the split-off, which was finally achieved on September 23 of Liberty Capital and Liberty Starz. Liberty Starz has one last quarter of attribution issues around Starz Media still affecting the numbers. Going forward will be clean, but looking at the business, we had strong subscriber growth at Starz, subs were up over 9%, and Encore subs were up over 3% over last year. We also had strong revenue and adjusted OIBDA results. We debuted a new series, Boss, on the 21st of October to very positive reviews. I think it\'s a great show, one I enjoy watching and I encourage you to look as well. And what many of you have been waiting for, we finally began repurchasing stock in Liberty Starz. We bought back $51 million worth or 807,000 shares through the 31st of October. Looking at Liberty Capital, we made a strategic investment in Barnes & Noble through a convertible preferred stock. That stock converts into about a 16.6% common equity stake in Barnes & Noble. It has a 7.75% quarterly dividend. We also took 2 board seats at Barnes & Noble and we\'re excited about the things they\'re doing. So many of you, yesterday, saw the exciting announcement they made around 2 new NOOKs, an update to the color NOOK and an update to their lower end e-ink reader, both of which garnered very positive reviews. During the quarter, we also repurchased $169 million or 2.5 million shares of Liberty Capital. Looking at some of our larger constituent investments, SiriusXM posted very strong -- results driven by an excellent operating performance. They ended the quarter with over 21.3 million subscribers. Adjusted EBITDA at Sirius was up 16%. Free cash flow was up 22%, and they continued to reduce their financial leverage. We also saw very good results at Live Nation, another of our investee companies. Adjusted operating income at Live Nation increased just about 7%. The concert AOI, adjusted operating income, increased about 35%. Free cash flow was up almost 5% and we saw some excellent and exciting continued innovation there. High Facebook engagement, a dynamic pricing tool they introduced, which is -- look to the inventory and try to maximize the value of it, for a venue owner, and a joint venture with Groupon, which is a way to, in a attractive fashion, help make sure excess inventory is moved. All exciting and all very positive at Live Nation. With that, let me turn it over to Chris Shean to talk in more detail about our financial results. Christopher W. Shean Thanks, Greg. The results for Starz for the 3 months ended September 30, 2011 include both the Legacy Starz Entertainment business, as well as the Legacy Starz Media business, as a result of the reattribution that took place on September 30 of last year. So in order to have a better comparison, we\'ve also combined the historical periods so that we have apples-to-apples for this discussion. Starz LLC\'s revenue decreased 2% to $389 million for the third quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the number of theatrical films released on home video, a decrease in animation revenue and no theatrical films released in 2011. That\'s offset by higher effective rates and increased subscriber counts at the Starz Channels. Adjusted OIBDA increased to $107 million or 27%. At quarter-end, Liberty Starz had attributed cash of $1.1 billion and attributed debt of only $41 million. From August 1 through October 31, approximately 807,000 shares of the L Starz A common stock were repurchased at an average price of $62.85. For total cash consideration of $50.7 million. Now with that, we\'ll have Chris Albrecht comment more deeply on events at Starz. Chris Albrecht Good morning. As Chris mentioned, the Starz businesses, again, performed very well in the third quarter. Looking at Starz Entertainment, in addition to solid revenue and OIBDA results, the flagship Starz Channel ended the third quarter at 19 million subscribers, while Encore finished at 32.8 million subscribers. For year-over-year comparisons, Starz subscriptions increased 1.6 million or 9%, versus third quarter 2010. All Encore subscriptions were up 3% or 800,000 in comparison to the same period from a year ago. We realized 71% of this flagship channel growth at consignment rate affiliates, thus boosting our revenue and OIBDA results. However, the growth of our flagship channels during the third quarter of 2011 was tempered by a lack of access to marketing campaigns with certain consignment affiliates, as well as a reduction in subscribers from one flat affiliate deal.  With respect to our Digital business, the terrific complement of Starz Originals programming, exclusive first-run movies and our quality film library content, continues to draw a great interest from current and prospective distributors in the marketplace. We\'re very pleased that AT&T U-Verse launched our authenticated Starz Online and Encore Online services on September 30. On the networks issue, as we\'ve said on previous calls, maintaining the premium nature of our brand with appropriate wholesale pricing and packaging is critical to potential online distribution agreements. There were -- these were the primary factors in our decision last quarter to end renewable discussions with Netflix. When we considered the underlying business we have with our traditional multi-channel distributors and studios, we didn\'t believe it was appropriate for the Starz brand to have our products included in a low-cost service.  The third quarter marks significant progress on the Starz Original front, with several developments that will impact positively our future original programming slates. Da Vinci\'s Demons will be the first original series that runs through our new development production and distribution partnership with BBC Worldwide Productions. This is an innovative arrangement that accelerates our ability to meet the ultimate goal of entering annually on Starz, approximately 50 hours of original content, yet a structure to mitigate financial risk and reduce total programming cash expended. Da Vinci\'s Demons is a historical fantasy set in Florence, that tells the untold story of Leonardo Da Vinci during his wild youth and the aid to the Renaissance. The story is written by David Goyer, who wrote Batman Begins, the Dark Knight and the upcoming, Man of Steel. Da Vinci\'s Demons and all subsequent programming produced from BBC world -- with the BBC Worldwide partnership will debut exclusively in the United States on Starz. Our worldwide distribution TV group, Anchor Bay and Starz Digital Media, will distribute the programming across television, home video and digital platforms, respectively, in the U.S. and English-speaking Canada. Last month, we were also pleased to announce the 2-year overall agreement with Spartacus Showrunner\'s Steven DeKnight. Steven is a wonderfully creative writer and his enormous talents will give us even more opportunities to bring premium fare to our channels. For our current series, Boss, we\'ve aired 3 episodes. We\'re 3 episodes into the 8-episode first season. We\'re heartened with the strong buzz and critical acclaim for the series. Interest in Starz affiliates to sample the first episode of this series was a record-high for the company, as more than 76 million multi-channel households offered the first episode early to current and prospective Starz subscribers, in addition to online availability nationwide. We look for Boss to continue to build an audience, particularly on the high -- on the On Demand and online platforms, and we were delighted to renew it for a second season. We expect increased marketing and amortization costs in the fourth quarter of 2011 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These increased costs are associated with our new original series, Boss, and are due to the fact that we did not have an original series in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Spartacus, returns to Starz on January 27, 2012, with Spartacus Vengeance. The second season will be an epic 10 episodes, and there is great interest and enthusiasm around the globe from hard-core and casual fans alike. As you may have read yesterday, we have greenlit a third season with an eye towards a 2013 return. Magic City makes its Starz debut next. Set in Miami Beach, circa 1959, Magic City is an 8-episode original series from writer-director-producer, Mitch Glazer, and features a great international cast led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Olga Kurylenko. Magic City was showcased for prospective buyers at the recent Mipcom Global Content Marketplace event in Cannes. It was well-received, as was the Spartacus franchise, which continues to show global appeal. Starz owns all domestic and international rights for the Spartacus and Magic City franchise, including TV, home video and digital.  Over at Starz Media, we\'ve made good progress solidifying the flow of content at Anchor Bay, with a consistent pipeline of new home video products from The Weinstein Company. Starz Originals, Anchor Bay Films and other licensed titles, such as, The Walking Dead from AMC. Recent highlights at Anchor Bay include, Spartacus: Gods of the Arena, which is tracking on par in all territories with the highly successful Spartacus Season 1, Blood and Sand, which sold through to consumers more than 400,000 units in the U.S. And also The Walking Dead, which has already sold through more than 500,000 copies to the consumers of its Season 1. And with that, I will turn the call back over to Chris. Christopher W. Shean Okay. Let\'s turn to Liberty Capital. Liberty Capital group\'s revenue decreased to $151 million in the third quarter and adjusted OIBDA remained flat at $25 million. Liberty Capital group had attributed cash and public investments of $7.1 billion and attributed debt of $750 million. From August 1 through October 31, 2.5 million shares of LCAPA common stock were repurchased at an average price of $68.15 for total cash consideration of $168.5 million. Cumulative repurchases since reclassification of the tracking stock, represent 41.3% of the original shares outstanding. The Board recently increased the Liberty Capital repurchase authorization by $500 million and the current authorization stands at $637 million -- $637.8 million. And we\'ll turn the call back over to Greg to wrap it up. Gregory B. Maffei Thank you, Chris Shean, and thank you, Chris Albrecht, for the update on your business. We were pleased with the results of our businesses in what continued to be an uncertain environment for the consumer. Looking forward, our priorities at Liberty Starz are to continue to execute on our original content strategy to differentiate and strengthen Starz and its brand. We look to build and enhance our relationship with our existing and new distributors. We\'re evaluating opportunities for the cash on Liberty Starz and for more aggressive balance sheet management. Looking at Liberty Capital, we also are looking to deploy or invest our excess capital in attractive situations. We look to rationalize some of the non-core investments that are on, that we hold, and to aggressively manage the balance sheet at Liberty Capital as well. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. We look forward to seeing many of you next week at our investor meeting. Stay tuned for more announcements. Thank you for listening. And with that, Operator, I\'d like to open up the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll hear first from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Greg, you bought back stock at the pretty terrific prices in a quarter-average near their lows. I was hoping you could offer your share repurchase philosophy going forward. Was that just a value opportunity? Or do you expect more consistent share repurchases looking forward? Gregory B. Maffei Well, thank you for the compliment on our stock taking, Doug. Look, I think we have a case where we try and have a consistent philosophy of return of capital, but we also do on the margin, try and be thoughtful about leaning in more aggressively when the prices seem to fluctuate low. So we do not, as a matter of policy, indicate what our plans are in the coming quarter for share repurchase, but I can give you our overall philosophy is, to return capital where we have its excess and to lean in more heavily when we see attractive value. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division And on the tracking stock, structure now that the lean-to-split is complete, and given your long-term strategy of trying to increase value of these stocks, can you talk a bit about the rationale behind having Starz and LCAPA, set up as tracking stocks going forward? Or is there a more ideal structure that you would consider? Gregory B. Maffei Well, I think you noted, our philosophy is for the long-term value and that is certainly what we\'re targeting. We think the tracking stocks have been useful in illuminating some of the operations that we have, while retaining flexibility for us on some tax matters and in terms of potentially changing the composition of businesses. We have no current plans to change our tracking stock structures, but it\'s also not inconceivable that in the future, if there was a -- we saw a more attractive way to organize the stocks or a more attractive way to utilize capital, we could change the structure. Operator We\'ll hear next from James Ratcliffe from Barclays Capital. James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division Two if I could. First of all, can you talk about the prospects for getting the Starz online content distributed more widely among the your existing, we just heard, MSO, DBS telco distributor base beyond, basically, DISH and Comcast to the other major distributors? And to serve what the gating factors around having that happen are? And secondly, could you clarify why there was the Starz L capital loan in the quarter, given that LCAPA seems to be seeing [ph] A lot of cash? Gregory B. Maffei You want, Chris, you want to talk about it, sure? On the first part. Chris Albrecht On the online distribution, we try to work with all our distributors to give them the full array of products that we have available. Including our online products. Several distributors want them integrated into their own platforms. We also realized the value of having our own platform as we see the consumer being interested in that. As we announced, Starz online and Encore Online were just launched by the AT&T U-Verse, and we look forward to more discussions with our traditional distributors. And certainly, also look to talk -- to discuss with them any opportunities that we might have together to get our products to them, in packages that are more interesting and advantageous to the consumer. Chris Shean, you want to talk about the loan? Christopher W. Shean Yes. In anticipation of the spin-off, there was some cash balances inside LCAP that we could not access on a near-term basis. And as a result, we put in place this short-term loan across the groups. James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division Great. And I have one follow-up for Chris, if I could. Could you just talk a little bit about what sort of response you\'ve gotten from your core distributor partners, from walking away from the Netflix transaction? How that\'s been received? Chris Albrecht Well, yes, I think that would really be a question that you would be better to ask them. I mean, we made the decision for ourselves, we looked at the overall Starz business, we evaluate any decision with the net long-term benefit for Starz. This was a decision that we were very comfortable with, and it was consistent with things that we\'ve said about how we\'re handling our business and certainly consistent with how we look at it going forward. Gregory B. Maffei But if I could add one thought there. The actions we took, as Chris has noted, were taken because we believed in the premium nature of our product and how it was best placed in the future. Many of our traditional distributors have embraced that notion fully. And I think actions, which we took, which were consistent with their distribution philosophy are only going to be well-received and have been commented upon favorably. Operator We\'ll hear next from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG, LLC, Research Division It\'s actually Brandon Ross, for Rich. A couple of questions. First, you mentioned earlier that some of your distributors were not marketing as effectively as other distributors? Just wondering if you could speak to which ones those are and what the issues are? Gregory B. Maffei Well, I think you\'ve heard recently from one of the major MPPDs [ph] that they have realized that they would like to focus or refocus their efforts in the premium category. We certainly agree with that decision and look forward to seeing the mutual benefit of that work going forward. And also we -- well, with regard to your question in the marketing campaign, I think I\'ll stand by that statement as far -- yes. Brandon Ross - BTIG, LLC, Research Division And with regard to DISH, is the Blockbuster Movie Pass and what they\'re doing with it, permissible under your existing agreement? Gregory B. Maffei Yes. I mean the Blockbuster Movie pass is really more analogous than authenticated service. I mean you have to be a DISH subscriber in order to have it. So we -- we are -- we have a very strong rights position with regard to our ability to distribute digitally and the Blockbuster Movie Pass is just one of the ways that our distributors are taking advantage of the services that Starz can offer them. Operator We\'ll hear next from Ben Mogil from Stifel, Nicolaus. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division And sort of just following up on the last question. When you guys are looking at sort of the premium category, in general, a couple of the MSOs were obviously cautious on the demand trends, do you think that as you sort of leave Netflix potentially, that helps out? Do you think this is an issue of an economic issue? Like I\'m sort of curious from a higher level perspective, how you sort of see the issue that the MSOs are talking about, and sort of where your -- what\'s your best sort of game plan within that environment? Gregory B. Maffei I\'m not really sure when you say what issues the MSOs are talking about. Could you just clarify that? Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Sure, yes, I mean, a couple of the MSOs, were noting very weak demand, or weaker demand for premium channels. So I\'m kind of curious when you look at that, and you look at sort of the consumers still under pressure, is your perspective that, as you continue to sort of work more closely with them, that\'s the best for you and that you\'ll eventually get some more marketing support, which was sort of being weak as you noted earlier this year? Gregory B. Maffei Yes, we haven\'t seen weak demand. I mean, we have -- certainly have seen subscriber growth, and when -- this is really a -- I think what has been a question of marketing and focus. And we certainly see the premium business as a win-win for the distributors and obviously for the premium brands. And they cemented a lot of product, they pulled through a lot of product through. And we think that they are realizing the value of those brands, and certainly don\'t want to turn their backs on a business that\'s been good to everybody. I hope that answers your question. Operator We\'ll take our next question from Tony Wible from Janney. Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division I was hoping you could speak to the Starz Media and how we should think about the pipeline of product there? And also on that business, what do you guys think about the margin structure? Is that just going to be more of a variable cost than margin business? Or do you expect to see some scale in that business at some point? Chris Albrecht With regard to the first question, there\'s been some transition in the sense that, when Anchor Bay released the Overture title that was revenue flowing in, whereas with the Weinstein deal, we have a distribution deal with them. And thus, because it\'s a distribution deal with another company, we\'re also not in charge of what they\'re theatrical release pattern is, and how much marketing support they put behind it. So there\'s going to be some variables just in the content flow. I mean with regard to certain numbers, we also -- the last week of September released the Gods of the Arena box set, and the Camelot box set. So those -- so third quarter was barely affected by that. But I do think, going forward, this is a variable business, and we certainly look to scale it by trying to leverage that platform, not just with our own product, but with third-party product like we\'ve done with Walking Dead. And Anchor Bay also serves a very important strategic function for the Starz Channels, providing us with a lot of low-cost theatricals that help us meet our distribution deal requirements. So there\'s a good strategic and financial reason to have it. It is in areas that are obviously more variable and lower margin than premium television businesses. Operator We\'ll take our next question from Michael Lima from PSAM Investment Management. Unknown Analyst -  It\'s Rich Filatti [ph]. For the first time, in over 2 years or 1.5 years, getting an opportunity to reconstruct your balance sheets to be optimized. And that\'s a huge opportunity. You talk about, a, the relative level of leverage you\'d like to have on each of the 2 entities, which I know you discussed in the past, but then b, a more sophisticated variation on that, which is -- how do you compare the efficacy of buying back LCAPA versus buying back Liberty Starz? I know you can\'t give us the numbers or the thresholds, but talk about the methodology or the philosophy that you used to allocate capital between those levels. So what\'s the right debt leverage and how do you calculate the efficacy of buying back stock of the 2 entities? Gregory B. Maffei Okay. First on relative level of leverage, I think for the long-term, the right level of leverage at Liberty Capital is effectively 0. It holds, basically, very little free cash flow generating assets. It holds mostly a portfolio of investments, which -- of which we have substantial value, but we don\'t get substantial cash flow. We have a de minimus amount of that since we consolidate and have access to that cash flow. And when you look at the overhead of the company and flexibility, it\'s going to be virtually 0. If you think about... Unknown Analyst -  What about Starz? Gregory B. Maffei Starz, I think it\'s a conservatively -- conservatively, it\'s a business that can probably support 3x leverage. It\'s a well-capitalized -- I mean, well -- one-subscription business with high free cash flow generation. So at the right time, over the longer term, I would say that\'s the kind of balance sheet we can support. When you look at the share repurchase, it\'s a little bit of 2 different decisions. One is a capital allocation issue between investment opportunities externally at Liberty Capital, and share repurchased internally and when we see NAVs that are attractive of the value of the company between our own NAV and what the external marketplace is, and we find that the underlying securities are relatively attractively priced, we execute. And we have been doing that and bought back at Liberty Capital, over 41% of the stock, and driven up the NAV by something like over $30 per share. So that\'s been very effective. At Liberty Starz, it\'s a little more complicated, only because we\'ve talked about some of the strategic issues that we\'re looking to get completed over the -- overtime. Chris mentioned some of those today. And I\'ll reiterate just in case it\'s not clear. Continue to grow our original programming strategy, continue to improve our relationship with existing distributors, continue to grow our distribution base, resolve on how we\'re going to fund some of the original programming. And some of these we\'ve done and checked off. For example, "Oh no, what\'s clean-up Starz Media?" and while we clean with that one up, we\'ve set in place a form of the turbo project we outlined with the BBC. We\'ve begun original programming with some great efforts and more ahead expected. So we were sort of in a transition process towards what we think is a more certain business there. And we began -- because we\'ve seen some of that to dip our toe in on share repurchase -- with more confidence. Not a statement about what we\'re going to do going forward, but that\'s some of the factors that led us to do the share repurchase today. I don\'t know if that\'s helpful, Rich, in outlining some thoughts. Unknown Analyst -  Yes, and just one quick follow-up. So essentially, is it -- the comparison between buying Liberty Starz stock versus buying Liberty Capital\'s, since it all essentially...[indiscernible] Gregory B. Maffei I should have been more explicit. Those are 2 separate decisions. They have their own cash which has been attributed to each. On the margin, there are some liabilities that they share, but those really, given how strongly capitalized each entity is, do not come into play or have not come into play in our thinking about share repurchase. Each is riding in its own tub. Operator We\'ll hear next from Martin Pyykkonen from Wedge Partners. Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation A question on the premium versus older library content. When you listen to the last couple of weeks, the media companies largely speaking, are kind of having a, in my opinion, a field day in terms of what they\'re able to license namely the Netflix, and what they\'re getting. And Greg, you\'ve mentioned in the past, you think it\'s likely that somebody else from a digital syndication side would recognize a premium value. I think the names are kind of obvious, Google, Apple, Amazon, et cetera, without being name-specific. Because you said whether you think it would best expectations that, if there\'s going to be a deal of that sort of premium from a non-traditional digital syndicator, I think that a lot of investor expectations, thinking something would happen within a reasonable period -- I don\'t mean next week, but within the next several months, should people be thinking that way? Or is this a much longer-term solution from your side and their side as you see it? Gregory B. Maffei I\'ll comment on that, and ask Chris to add anything he wishes. Look, I think you will see digital distributors recognize the means of competition and the ways of competition in the marketplace may vary. You\'ve seen some already have different philosophies. And I think they\'ll begin to segment differentiate, and some will recognize the value of premium and price accordingly and set up an offering, accordingly. And that\'s probably a -- an action or a strategy that we would embrace. Chris, you want to add anything? Chris Albrecht Yes. I mean, I think with regard to, the first thing you mentioned about other people licensing content, I mean, when you look at the list of titles, a lot of the stuff that gets licensed are things that Starz -- the Starz or Encore brands would never license. It\'s too deep, old library product. With regard to entries into the digital space, that might be interested in creating premium tiers. I mean that\'s really the prerequisite for us, is are there new distributors that are interested in doing business that\'s consistent with the goals that we\'ve stated. And certainly, there are a lot of conversations going on, and we look at all of them and evaluate the long-term benefit to Starz, while also taking into consideration our relationships with our current core distributors and our studio partners. So it\'s certainly would seem that there is a bright future for new interest in our products. But it\'s a road that needs to be evaluated on almost a weekly basis and have prudent long-term decision thinking -- no decision-making thinking, at the forefront. Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation Okay, and then just one question on the original side. You\'ve always done a great job. You get, sounds like a lot of good scripts and all coming up, going into 2013, 50 to 60 hours, 4 to 5 series, kind of in your plan. Given back to the question of you may -- you get a lot of capital structure headroom there, could you -- and are there plans to notably increase that at any time in the near future in terms of the run rates, because it seems like you\'d do that, do it well, and yet have a lot of capital bandwidth to still do all the other things? I\'m just curious if that\'s a captor add or if that will go up? Chris Albrecht No, we think the 50 to 60-hour model, along with our 2 terrific output deals, Disney and Sony, which are locked in for the next few years at least, are a very good program mix, especially given the strategies that the 2 other major premium brands have. I think it nestles us in, in a very interesting place. I think we\'re priced very well with the distributors. And we\'re very comfortable with that model going forward. Should we see some unexpected increased revenue show up, we\'ll certainly look at how we might best deploy that to get the best return. But right now, we\'re, I think we\'re very comfortable with the model that we\'re working towards. And don\'t have any contrary plans to alter it. Operator Our final question will come from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division I wanted to ask about the comment about growth and marketing and amortization costs at Starz during the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little bit more elaboration, I mean, what degree of growth? I mean, are you still going to be able to grow EBITDA? That\'s my initial question. Chris Albrecht The answer to the first part is we didn\'t have a series in the fourth quarter last year. So we had a series in the fourth quarter of this year and obviously we had to market that. But as I just said before, our plans going forward have taken that into consideration. As we look at our programming costs, both on the film side and on the original programming side, we are going to be very comfortable with the 4-quarter strategy of having a series air, along with robust marketing campaigns, and still be able to grow the bottom line of the company, and hopefully, as well as the top line of the company. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division Okay, all right. And then switching gears a little bit to capital. SiriusXM has expressed an interest in ramping up share repurchase. But they also have made a comment, at least at the Merrill Lynch conference, that they don\'t want to increase Liberty\'s control over the company. And that raises questions about prospects for some type of agreement, perhaps freezing your voting interest or some other type of unlocking of your Sirius position. I was wondering if you could comment on your openness to those type of arrangements and your interest in doing that and what the timing might be of working on an arrangement with Sirius? Gregory B. Maffei We haven\'t had any discussions with them on that topic. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division Is that something that waits until March of 2012 to even begin or...? Gregory B. Maffei They\'ve said in the past, that when their leverage gets to a reduced enough level, that they were going to consider what to do with their -- to return capital to shareholders, or whether they would seek that. And I guess at that time we may have that discussion. Thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing, as we said, many of you next week in New York.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Operator [Operator Instructions] We\'ll hear first from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Greg, you bought back stock at the pretty terrific prices in a quarter-average near their lows. I was hoping you could offer your share repurchase philosophy going forward. Was that just a value opportunity? Or do you expect more consistent share repurchases looking forward? Gregory B. Maffei Well, thank you for the compliment on our stock taking, Doug. Look, I think we have a case where we try and have a consistent philosophy of return of capital, but we also do on the margin, try and be thoughtful about leaning in more aggressively when the prices seem to fluctuate low. So we do not, as a matter of policy, indicate what our plans are in the coming quarter for share repurchase, but I can give you our overall philosophy is, to return capital where we have its excess and to lean in more heavily when we see attractive value. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division And on the tracking stock, structure now that the lean-to-split is complete, and given your long-term strategy of trying to increase value of these stocks, can you talk a bit about the rationale behind having Starz and LCAPA, set up as tracking stocks going forward? Or is there a more ideal structure that you would consider? Gregory B. Maffei Well, I think you noted, our philosophy is for the long-term value and that is certainly what we\'re targeting. We think the tracking stocks have been useful in illuminating some of the operations that we have, while retaining flexibility for us on some tax matters and in terms of potentially changing the composition of businesses. We have no current plans to change our tracking stock structures, but it\'s also not inconceivable that in the future, if there was a -- we saw a more attractive way to organize the stocks or a more attractive way to utilize capital, we could change the structure. Operator We\'ll hear next from James Ratcliffe from Barclays Capital. James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division Two if I could. First of all, can you talk about the prospects for getting the Starz online content distributed more widely among the your existing, we just heard, MSO, DBS telco distributor base beyond, basically, DISH and Comcast to the other major distributors? And to serve what the gating factors around having that happen are? And secondly, could you clarify why there was the Starz L capital loan in the quarter, given that LCAPA seems to be seeing [ph] A lot of cash? Gregory B. Maffei You want, Chris, you want to talk about it, sure? On the first part. Chris Albrecht On the online distribution, we try to work with all our distributors to give them the full array of products that we have available. Including our online products. Several distributors want them integrated into their own platforms. We also realized the value of having our own platform as we see the consumer being interested in that. As we announced, Starz online and Encore Online were just launched by the AT&T U-Verse, and we look forward to more discussions with our traditional distributors. And certainly, also look to talk -- to discuss with them any opportunities that we might have together to get our products to them, in packages that are more interesting and advantageous to the consumer. Chris Shean, you want to talk about the loan? Christopher W. Shean Yes. In anticipation of the spin-off, there was some cash balances inside LCAP that we could not access on a near-term basis. And as a result, we put in place this short-term loan across the groups. James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division Great. And I have one follow-up for Chris, if I could. Could you just talk a little bit about what sort of response you\'ve gotten from your core distributor partners, from walking away from the Netflix transaction? How that\'s been received? Chris Albrecht Well, yes, I think that would really be a question that you would be better to ask them. I mean, we made the decision for ourselves, we looked at the overall Starz business, we evaluate any decision with the net long-term benefit for Starz. This was a decision that we were very comfortable with, and it was consistent with things that we\'ve said about how we\'re handling our business and certainly consistent with how we look at it going forward. Gregory B. Maffei But if I could add one thought there. The actions we took, as Chris has noted, were taken because we believed in the premium nature of our product and how it was best placed in the future. Many of our traditional distributors have embraced that notion fully. And I think actions, which we took, which were consistent with their distribution philosophy are only going to be well-received and have been commented upon favorably. Operator We\'ll hear next from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Brandon Ross - BTIG, LLC, Research Division It\'s actually Brandon Ross, for Rich. A couple of questions. First, you mentioned earlier that some of your distributors were not marketing as effectively as other distributors? Just wondering if you could speak to which ones those are and what the issues are? Gregory B. Maffei Well, I think you\'ve heard recently from one of the major MPPDs [ph] that they have realized that they would like to focus or refocus their efforts in the premium category. We certainly agree with that decision and look forward to seeing the mutual benefit of that work going forward. And also we -- well, with regard to your question in the marketing campaign, I think I\'ll stand by that statement as far -- yes. Brandon Ross - BTIG, LLC, Research Division And with regard to DISH, is the Blockbuster Movie Pass and what they\'re doing with it, permissible under your existing agreement? Gregory B. Maffei Yes. I mean the Blockbuster Movie pass is really more analogous than authenticated service. I mean you have to be a DISH subscriber in order to have it. So we -- we are -- we have a very strong rights position with regard to our ability to distribute digitally and the Blockbuster Movie Pass is just one of the ways that our distributors are taking advantage of the services that Starz can offer them. Operator We\'ll hear next from Ben Mogil from Stifel, Nicolaus. Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division And sort of just following up on the last question. When you guys are looking at sort of the premium category, in general, a couple of the MSOs were obviously cautious on the demand trends, do you think that as you sort of leave Netflix potentially, that helps out? Do you think this is an issue of an economic issue? Like I\'m sort of curious from a higher level perspective, how you sort of see the issue that the MSOs are talking about, and sort of where your -- what\'s your best sort of game plan within that environment? Gregory B. Maffei I\'m not really sure when you say what issues the MSOs are talking about. Could you just clarify that? Benjamin Mogil - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division Sure, yes, I mean, a couple of the MSOs, were noting very weak demand, or weaker demand for premium channels. So I\'m kind of curious when you look at that, and you look at sort of the consumers still under pressure, is your perspective that, as you continue to sort of work more closely with them, that\'s the best for you and that you\'ll eventually get some more marketing support, which was sort of being weak as you noted earlier this year? Gregory B. Maffei Yes, we haven\'t seen weak demand. I mean, we have -- certainly have seen subscriber growth, and when -- this is really a -- I think what has been a question of marketing and focus. And we certainly see the premium business as a win-win for the distributors and obviously for the premium brands. And they cemented a lot of product, they pulled through a lot of product through. And we think that they are realizing the value of those brands, and certainly don\'t want to turn their backs on a business that\'s been good to everybody. I hope that answers your question. Operator We\'ll take our next question from Tony Wible from Janney. Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division I was hoping you could speak to the Starz Media and how we should think about the pipeline of product there? And also on that business, what do you guys think about the margin structure? Is that just going to be more of a variable cost than margin business? Or do you expect to see some scale in that business at some point? Chris Albrecht With regard to the first question, there\'s been some transition in the sense that, when Anchor Bay released the Overture title that was revenue flowing in, whereas with the Weinstein deal, we have a distribution deal with them. And thus, because it\'s a distribution deal with another company, we\'re also not in charge of what they\'re theatrical release pattern is, and how much marketing support they put behind it. So there\'s going to be some variables just in the content flow. I mean with regard to certain numbers, we also -- the last week of September released the Gods of the Arena box set, and the Camelot box set. So those -- so third quarter was barely affected by that. But I do think, going forward, this is a variable business, and we certainly look to scale it by trying to leverage that platform, not just with our own product, but with third-party product like we\'ve done with Walking Dead. And Anchor Bay also serves a very important strategic function for the Starz Channels, providing us with a lot of low-cost theatricals that help us meet our distribution deal requirements. So there\'s a good strategic and financial reason to have it. It is in areas that are obviously more variable and lower margin than premium television businesses. Operator We\'ll take our next question from Michael Lima from PSAM Investment Management. Unknown Analyst -  It\'s Rich Filatti [ph]. For the first time, in over 2 years or 1.5 years, getting an opportunity to reconstruct your balance sheets to be optimized. And that\'s a huge opportunity. You talk about, a, the relative level of leverage you\'d like to have on each of the 2 entities, which I know you discussed in the past, but then b, a more sophisticated variation on that, which is -- how do you compare the efficacy of buying back LCAPA versus buying back Liberty Starz? I know you can\'t give us the numbers or the thresholds, but talk about the methodology or the philosophy that you used to allocate capital between those levels. So what\'s the right debt leverage and how do you calculate the efficacy of buying back stock of the 2 entities? Gregory B. Maffei Okay. First on relative level of leverage, I think for the long-term, the right level of leverage at Liberty Capital is effectively 0. It holds, basically, very little free cash flow generating assets. It holds mostly a portfolio of investments, which -- of which we have substantial value, but we don\'t get substantial cash flow. We have a de minimus amount of that since we consolidate and have access to that cash flow. And when you look at the overhead of the company and flexibility, it\'s going to be virtually 0. If you think about... Unknown Analyst -  What about Starz? Gregory B. Maffei Starz, I think it\'s a conservatively -- conservatively, it\'s a business that can probably support 3x leverage. It\'s a well-capitalized -- I mean, well -- one-subscription business with high free cash flow generation. So at the right time, over the longer term, I would say that\'s the kind of balance sheet we can support. When you look at the share repurchase, it\'s a little bit of 2 different decisions. One is a capital allocation issue between investment opportunities externally at Liberty Capital, and share repurchased internally and when we see NAVs that are attractive of the value of the company between our own NAV and what the external marketplace is, and we find that the underlying securities are relatively attractively priced, we execute. And we have been doing that and bought back at Liberty Capital, over 41% of the stock, and driven up the NAV by something like over $30 per share. So that\'s been very effective. At Liberty Starz, it\'s a little more complicated, only because we\'ve talked about some of the strategic issues that we\'re looking to get completed over the -- overtime. Chris mentioned some of those today. And I\'ll reiterate just in case it\'s not clear. Continue to grow our original programming strategy, continue to improve our relationship with existing distributors, continue to grow our distribution base, resolve on how we\'re going to fund some of the original programming. And some of these we\'ve done and checked off. For example, "Oh no, what\'s clean-up Starz Media?" and while we clean with that one up, we\'ve set in place a form of the turbo project we outlined with the BBC. We\'ve begun original programming with some great efforts and more ahead expected. So we were sort of in a transition process towards what we think is a more certain business there. And we began -- because we\'ve seen some of that to dip our toe in on share repurchase -- with more confidence. Not a statement about what we\'re going to do going forward, but that\'s some of the factors that led us to do the share repurchase today. I don\'t know if that\'s helpful, Rich, in outlining some thoughts. Unknown Analyst -  Yes, and just one quick follow-up. So essentially, is it -- the comparison between buying Liberty Starz stock versus buying Liberty Capital\'s, since it all essentially...[indiscernible] Gregory B. Maffei I should have been more explicit. Those are 2 separate decisions. They have their own cash which has been attributed to each. On the margin, there are some liabilities that they share, but those really, given how strongly capitalized each entity is, do not come into play or have not come into play in our thinking about share repurchase. Each is riding in its own tub. Operator We\'ll hear next from Martin Pyykkonen from Wedge Partners. Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation A question on the premium versus older library content. When you listen to the last couple of weeks, the media companies largely speaking, are kind of having a, in my opinion, a field day in terms of what they\'re able to license namely the Netflix, and what they\'re getting. And Greg, you\'ve mentioned in the past, you think it\'s likely that somebody else from a digital syndication side would recognize a premium value. I think the names are kind of obvious, Google, Apple, Amazon, et cetera, without being name-specific. Because you said whether you think it would best expectations that, if there\'s going to be a deal of that sort of premium from a non-traditional digital syndicator, I think that a lot of investor expectations, thinking something would happen within a reasonable period -- I don\'t mean next week, but within the next several months, should people be thinking that way? Or is this a much longer-term solution from your side and their side as you see it? Gregory B. Maffei I\'ll comment on that, and ask Chris to add anything he wishes. Look, I think you will see digital distributors recognize the means of competition and the ways of competition in the marketplace may vary. You\'ve seen some already have different philosophies. And I think they\'ll begin to segment differentiate, and some will recognize the value of premium and price accordingly and set up an offering, accordingly. And that\'s probably a -- an action or a strategy that we would embrace. Chris, you want to add anything? Chris Albrecht Yes. I mean, I think with regard to, the first thing you mentioned about other people licensing content, I mean, when you look at the list of titles, a lot of the stuff that gets licensed are things that Starz -- the Starz or Encore brands would never license. It\'s too deep, old library product. With regard to entries into the digital space, that might be interested in creating premium tiers. I mean that\'s really the prerequisite for us, is are there new distributors that are interested in doing business that\'s consistent with the goals that we\'ve stated. And certainly, there are a lot of conversations going on, and we look at all of them and evaluate the long-term benefit to Starz, while also taking into consideration our relationships with our current core distributors and our studio partners. So it\'s certainly would seem that there is a bright future for new interest in our products. But it\'s a road that needs to be evaluated on almost a weekly basis and have prudent long-term decision thinking -- no decision-making thinking, at the forefront. Martin Pyykkonen - Wedge Partners Corporation Okay, and then just one question on the original side. You\'ve always done a great job. You get, sounds like a lot of good scripts and all coming up, going into 2013, 50 to 60 hours, 4 to 5 series, kind of in your plan. Given back to the question of you may -- you get a lot of capital structure headroom there, could you -- and are there plans to notably increase that at any time in the near future in terms of the run rates, because it seems like you\'d do that, do it well, and yet have a lot of capital bandwidth to still do all the other things? I\'m just curious if that\'s a captor add or if that will go up? Chris Albrecht No, we think the 50 to 60-hour model, along with our 2 terrific output deals, Disney and Sony, which are locked in for the next few years at least, are a very good program mix, especially given the strategies that the 2 other major premium brands have. I think it nestles us in, in a very interesting place. I think we\'re priced very well with the distributors. And we\'re very comfortable with that model going forward. Should we see some unexpected increased revenue show up, we\'ll certainly look at how we might best deploy that to get the best return. But right now, we\'re, I think we\'re very comfortable with the model that we\'re working towards. And don\'t have any contrary plans to alter it. Operator Our final question will come from Barton Crockett from Lazard Capital Markets. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division I wanted to ask about the comment about growth and marketing and amortization costs at Starz during the fourth quarter. Can you give us a little bit more elaboration, I mean, what degree of growth? I mean, are you still going to be able to grow EBITDA? That\'s my initial question. Chris Albrecht The answer to the first part is we didn\'t have a series in the fourth quarter last year. So we had a series in the fourth quarter of this year and obviously we had to market that.

Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division Okay, all right. And then switching gears a little bit to capital. SiriusXM has expressed an interest in ramping up share repurchase. But they also have made a comment, at least at the Merrill Lynch conference, that they don\'t want to increase Liberty\'s control over the company.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Courtnee Ulrich, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Courtnee Ulrich Good morning. Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that this call includes certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about financial guidance, business strategies, market potential, future financial performance, new service and product launches, the proposed separation from Starz, LLC and the benefits expected to flow therefrom and other matters that are not historical facts.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Media's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted OIBDA. The required definitions and reconciliations, preliminary notes and schedules 1 through 3 can be found at the end of this presentation. With that, Id like to turn it over to Greg Maffei, Liberty Media's, President and CEO. Gregory B. Maffei  Thank you, Courtnee and good morning to all of you on the line. Today, speaking on the call besides myself, we will have Liberty's CFO, Chris Shean; and Starz CEO, Chris Albrecht, other Liberty and Starz executives are available to answer questions as well. So on to the highlights. For Starz, this morning we made a large announcement, our plan to separate Liberty Media and Starz. Our rationale for this is as follows. While Starz's management team has done a very good job building the brand and subscriber base and Starz's business ultimately going forward we think the spin could optimize this Starz capital structure, creates more flexibility for capital market decisions and partnerships, provides better transparency on Starz operating business and we will highlight the value and strength of the underlying company. We ultimately, this company is more valuable as a standalone company with its own currency and will create shareholder value for the Liberty Media shareholders. It also because of the nature of the dividend we expect to pay from Starz to Liberty Media will create significant liquidity rather for Liberty Media, which will preserve all of our options with respect to Sirius, Live Nation and Barnes & Noble. We expect the timing of this transaction is such that we should be able to close by year-end, and were as I said, we're excited about the prospects for an independent Starz going forward. Turning now to SiriusXM, we closed on our previously announced forward purchase in July, which now takes our ownership to just over 46%. The value of our investment in SiriusXM today or as rather as of yesterday's close was $6.8 billion. We were very pleased with the operating results at Sirius as well. They reported yesterday, subscribers were up to 22.9 million, revenue was up 13%, adjusted EBITDA was up 28%, and they raised their 2012 guidance to $900 million. Notably during the quarter, we also repurchased $96 million of our own LMCA stock. With that, let me turn it over to Chris Shean to talk about the financial results at Liberty Media. Christopher W. Shean Thanks Greg. Liberty Media's revenue and adjusted OIBDA remain relatively flat at $537 million and $126 million respectively in the second quarter. Starz LLC's revenue remained unchanged at $403 million for the second quarter as the increase in revenue for the Starz Channels business was offset by decreases for the Starz Distribution and Starz Animation businesses. Starz's adjusted OIBDA decreased 8% to $108 million for the second quarter as a result of a decrease in the Starz Channels business. Looking at the liquidity picture, at quarter-end, Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $1.8 billion and debt of $543 million. Now Chris Albrecht will comment on events at Starz. Chris Albrecht Thanks, Chris and good morning. As Greg discussed at the top of the call, Starz, LLC will become its own independent company. The senior Starz team and I are very energized by this decision. While there have been great benefits to being part of Liberty, I believe this standalone structure is the first step to unlocking the real potential growth opportunities for Starz. This immediately allows us to build a more appropriate capital structure and provide us with the currency to explore potential strategic alliances, acquisitions and other value-enhancing strategies for our businesses. We at Starz have broad and deep relationships in both the content and distribution communities. There is a long list of companies interested in having alliances with Starz. Turning our attention to earnings, the Starz business has performed well in the second quarter of 2012. At the end of the quarter, Starz subscribers were 20.7 million and ENCORE had 34.2 million for a combined subscription total of nearly 55 million. In comparison to the first quarter of 2012, this represents net new subscriber growth of 600,000 at each of the channels with the majority of the subscriber growth coming from distributors with fixed-rate agreements. This solid demand makes Starz and ENCORE the most highly subscribed pair of premium services in the U.S. We remain steadfast and focused on optimizing our distributor relationships and are aggressively pursuing ways to build incremental value for our products and services. To that end, all three of our flagship services will launch newly branded authenticated platforms. We're retaining the Play moniker from our previous online product and we'll shift it over to the new online product Starz Play, ENCORE Play and MoviePlex Play.  Before the end of the year, these products will launch to PCs and Macs, iPhones and iPads and select Android handsets and tablets. As noted on our last call, Starz has online deals in place with distributors using their platforms that cover roughly two-thirds of all multichannel households. As you're all aware of the recent well-publicized negotiations between certain distributors and programmers, we also do have affiliation agreements that expire from time-to-time. Starz has a history of renewing these agreements on acceptable terms. However, there can be no assurance the terms will be as favorable as the prior agreements. Creatively, we continue to make investments in exciting original programming to complement our already strong lineup of the first run blockbuster movies. Season 2 of Boss, starring Golden Globe winner Kelsey Grammer debuted later this month. Global anticipation is also building for the next installment of Spartacus, which will begin its final season in January 2013. Da Vinci's Demons will debut next on Starz in the spring of 2013. This is the first full series arriving from our partnership with BBC Worldwide Productions. Starz retains full multi-platform rights for Da Vinci in the U.S. and English speaking Canada. The show is historical fantasy following untold story of the young Leonardo da Vinci and is written by David Goyer, screenwriter of the Dark Knight Rises and the upcoming Man of Steel. Season 2 of Magic City will round out the first half of 2013. ENCORE had a particularly strong July with the Bond collection featuring 19 classic James Bond movies which performed notably well with more than 13 million viewers having watched one or more of the films. Also with ENCORE, we're initiating our previously announced miniseries strategy in September for the four-part presentation based on Michel Faber's bestselling novel, The Crimson Petal and the White. High-quality original acquisitions for ENCORE represent the type of targeted investments we are seeking to complement the robust movie lineup. On to the Starz distribution businesses, they are performing to our expectations and should benefit in the third quarter from the release of several high-profile new products including Spartacus - Vengeance in September, the first season of Magic City in October and Season 2 of AMC's The Walking Dead later this month. We are proud of the progress we are making with the Starz businesses and are on track to execute on our plan. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory B. Maffei So thank you. As noted, we think we had good results at Starz. We are excited about the prospects of a separate Liberty Media and a separate Starz. We appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media, and with that operator, I'd like to open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I had a question about the capitalization at Starz. You said there will be an undetermined amount of cash. I was wondering if you could give us some broad parameters, now is this something you think needs a lot of cash to go out and pursue acquisitions or does it need just a limited amount of cash, because it's so cash flow positive and limited working capital needs? Gregory B. Maffei Well, I think we are going to send it out with more leverage than it currently has today. Our expectation is that we'll pay a dividend of at least $1.8 billion up to between its existing cash at Starz and the availability of the revolver. The net of that is I think that the debt level at Starz will be something on the order of 2.5 times or less when it exits. The exact numbers will be dependent on some financings we are looking at, how much cash it generates between now and year end.  But above all, our goal is to send it out well, but conservatively capitalized with flexibility under its revolver and with its cash on hand to make sure it has the opportunity to either make partnerships, as Chris noted, repurchase its stock if it doesn't trade attractively in the short-term, and have other flexibilities as needed. So, I think it's going to be set with an appropriate but conservative capitalization. Chris, would you like to add anything? Christopher W. Shean Yeah. Barton, this is Chris. I would just say that obviously this has been a very carefully considered decision, and we at Starz are very comfortable with the balance sheet as we go forward and look to have the flexibility to take advantage of the opportunities that we are confident will arise. Gregory B. Maffei If I could add one more thing, this is a high cash flow generating business, there's a lot of free cash flow, relatively few demands on that cash flow. So, we think it can carry obviously more debt than it has today. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay, all right. Thats helpful. Now, I was also wondering if you could talk a little bit about why we have yet to see a firm statement about your intentions towards Sirius. I mean you've been taking steps buying more stock Mel was on the call yesterday saying that he hasn't really heard from Liberty a clear expression of what you want to do. A number of months have passed, I'm just wondering what are you waiting for, if you can talk about, and what do you need to see to kind of decide whether you want to fish or cut bait? Gregory B. Maffei Well. I think youve seen our actions and I forget what we said, you've seen our actions, we've increased our shares, we find them, weve bought at attractive prices, we find the increased ownership and influence at Sirius rather attractive and we'll decide ultimately how we wish to proceed with that stake. Our view is that Sirius is under-leveraged and there's plenty of opportunity for share repurchase and other financial actions of the Company, which we deem as ultimately positive and being a shareholder, an increased shareholder in Sirius is a good thing. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay. Does this separation is this a hurdle you need to get through before you take more definitive steps with Sirius? Gregory B. Maffei Is what a hurdle, sorry I'm not sure Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets The separation of Liberty Media from Starz. Gregory B. Maffei No. The Starz split or more accurately, the LMCA's split away from Starz has no bearing on our impact at Sirius other than the discussion about leveraging Starz more than it is currently leveraged only provides us with more firepower, but we had plenty to begin with. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  Thanks so much. Couple of logistical questions for Greg, and then one for Chris. Greg, just following up on that, does this change the options that you would consider for Sirius at all? For example, I think Sirius shareholders think, Sirius is cheap, I think, you think LMCA is cheap. Post STARZ spin, you could merge the two together at market and call it a day. So, it's sort of new option that I didn't think was in play before. Does that make any sense? Gregory B. Maffei Well, you don't want to foreclose any options. I still believe that Liberty Media is trading at discount to NAV. We'll see what happens over the next period whether that neutralizes out. I would note we have a lot of cash at LMCA, more after the Starz dividend up to LMCA, Liberty Media, and our history has not been to issue huge amounts of stock, because in general, we believe, viewed our stock is undervalued, believed it was worth more, and we're more likely to pursue cash transactions. Having said that, I'd note the larger point, which I made to the other question, there is a ton of liquidity at Sirius. There's not only borrowing capacity today. Our anticipation is over the next several years there generate billions of dollars shielded by the NOLs with decreasing leverage and the bulk of the CapEx necessary for the satellite launches and the like are having already been spent. So, this is going to be a huge free cash flow generator. So I think this is not a case where we look and say, we need to be conservative with our cash or their cash by issuing stock, it's quite the opposite. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  Has STARZ been tainted all with M&A discussions in the past that would limit strategic flexibility for a tax-free sale post spin? I think a lot of people think sort of six months post spin, you are free and clear unless you had prior M&A discussions in the previous two years, right? Gregory B. Maffei  I'd like to believe that Liberty and Starz management have been thoughtful about any discussions in not preventing any future options in any timeframe. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  And then just quickly for Chris, any sense of return on capital strategy that you might pursue being CEO of a publicly traded company? Chris Albrecht   At this time, we're just going to proceed with our current plan and I think as we get closer to the actual date, we'll look and see what opportunities are there. As we said, this gives us a structure, a currency, and as we said before with regard to the balance sheet, a lot of flexibility to pursue all sorts of as I refer to them value enhancing strategies. So, at this time, I don't have anything specific to say. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Well take our next question from Ben Swinburne with MSSB. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney I think for Chris S., how much of the $1.8 billion of cash and liquid investments at end of the quarter are at Starz, LLC? Christopher W. Shean  About $1 billion. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney About $1 billion. Okay. And then for Chris A. on the Starz outlook, I don't know Chris, if you're willing to give us any sense for your distribution renewals, not necessarily by operator obviously, but just even percentages how much are up over the next two years, next four years, anyway you could put that into context?  You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have renewals coming up and that there's still this potential risk there, but any way to size that? And then, on the cost side, I think at the Investor Day, you guys commented that your Sony Disney deals, you started to benefit from maybe some lower sort of rate cards that kick in soon, any update on sort of when that are we already seeing that this year or what's the timing on that piece as well? Chris Albrecht On the second question, no, we haven't seen those. Those do not kick in this year. Those actually start to kick-in in 2013. With regard to our distributor relationships, we have probably about 19% of our business that is up for renewal in the next or I guess at the end of year, and we are obviously in active discussions all the time with our distributors, but we don't have anything specifically to comment on. Gregory B. Maffei But that's not unusual. Would you say Chris and Glenn move to sort of the normal role, we have a series of ones that come up all the time and nothing, there's not unusual load in the next six months for us. Chris Albrecht No, I mean, with the consolidation of the distribution business, that's actually a relatively small amounts considering what it could be. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Right, and then, Greg, just going back a bit to Doug's question, and thinking about whenever you guys announce a spin and then we need to ask about the next potential spin, which is just thinking about the SIRI position within new Liberty, is there a question now around timing on that option? I realize it's an option, not something that you're actually doing, but spinning out that stake and merging it in an RMT with SIRI, does that require some sort of post Starz spin cooling off period with the IRS just to think about that second spin if you guys were to move down that path? Gregory B. Maffei No, I don't think that that's the real driver. I think a consideration in our mind would be, and obviously we have announced no intent to do a Reverse Morris Trust. We've only suggested its one path. But I would note, if we pursued that path, something that would weigh on our mind is, we got the first 40% of the company for free virtually. The next 11 points have cost us well over $1 billion something if we got to 51. We would probably like to get the bait back on the 11 points. We've noted that there is flexibility in the capital structure at Sirius, there's plenty of availability for them over the next short-term to lever further and return capital to shareholders including ourselves, and whatever we did, we would be unlikely to want to spin out high basis stock, we'd probably given how much we've already shrunk Liberty Media over the last several years. Wed probably including this Starz transaction, we'd probably be wanting to get that cash back. So, that would be the biggest consideration in our minds, a major one. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Yeah. And so that was then I guess tying to what that residual Liberty would look like, which is you want to make sure it's robust, has enough cash, and there's stuff to do there beyond, I think it would just be basically the braves left if you were to go down that path? Gregory B. Maffei Well. No, there's a few other things. Live Nation, TruePosition Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney In terms of operating companies, I mean Gregory B. Maffei Barnes & Noble, TruePosition is an operating company. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Yeah. Gregory B. Maffei Yes, your point is right, we would significantly shrunk Liberty Media, still making sure that it had firepower, cash available for other investments or further investments in companies we already have stock in would be something we would probably endeavor. And again, it gets sort of against our nature to spin out full basis of cash. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Yeah. Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator Our next question comes from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Maxwell Ratcliffe  Barclays Capital, Inc.  Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, structurally and hypothetically, would it be possible to have two put transactions going simultaneously? So could you and SIRI have the new Liberty split going from the existing Liberty Corporation, at the same time, you are putting through a SIRI Reverse Morris Trust from that same current Liberty Corporate entity? Gregory B. Maffei Yeah. James, I think I just tried to answer that. I don't think that that's the driver in our minds, and the problem, the issue probably in our case is going to set the right capitalization at Sirius and make sure that we achieved what we wanted on our other objectives on that investment. That would probably be the driving issue. James Maxwell Ratcliffe  Barclays Capital, Inc.  Okay, got it. And then secondly, are there concerns for the new Liberty entity regarding the Investment Company Act? It looks like if you lose Starz, you are already getting an even a larger portion of the asset base in particular with all the new SIRI common stock in there that's actually publicly traded securities. Gregory B. Maffei  We believe that is not an issue. James Maxwell Ratcliffe  Barclays Capital, Inc.  Great, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from John Tinker with Maxim. John Tinker  Maxim Group Hi, you mentioned that in the release, you want to reserve your options with respect to Sirius and Live Nation. How are you thinking about Barnes & Noble? Gregory B. Maffei  Well, I mentioned Barnes & Noble in my comment as well. We are actually currently prevented until the pill expires at Barnes & Noble. If we so chose, we are currently prevented from increasing our stake by more than, I think, about 3.3%, so it's relatively de minimus issue, but I did mention in my comments Barnes & Noble. I don't think it was meant to ignore Barnes & Noble. It was only meant to acknowledge that's probably not given how we are currently restricted something that's on the top of the list. John Tinker  Maxim Group Just on that, one of the things I found confusing is Microsoft which I think is still intending to invest, it is launching Surface through its own stores, but it has an option to own, I would have thought, all of Barnes & Noble which would immediately get it access to far more stores. Do you have a view on how they're thinking about that? Gregory B. Maffei I think you'd have to ask the Microsoft management team that question honestly. John Tinker  Maxim Group Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners. Bryan Kraft  Evercore Partners Hi, thank you. I just had a follow-up question or I guess a question on your comments, Greg, about getting the right capital structure at Sirius. I mean, given the restricted payments baskets there, I mean there is a limitation on what they can buy back in stock, are you suggesting that you think that they should pay some fairly hefty call premiums to redeem some of that debt early in order to accelerate that process? That was my first question. And then, my second question is, can you just comment on the status of your application with the FCC for transfer of de facto control of Sirius. Thanks Gregory B. Maffei  Well. I am not suggesting that they should incur undue penalties in the bond market. They can obviously do breakevens and calculations on with the relative attractive rates today versus what they have to pull in going forward. I'm really talking over the next few quarters, when some of these things become callable to different rates, and when other financing flexibility becomes available and when they continue to generate more cash, that there will be cash available for share repurchase, combination of all those things. On the second question about the FCC, we are waiting to hear back on our application for de facto control, we have not yet heard from the FCC. Bryan Kraft  Evercore Partners Okay. And just if I could follow-up on the first one, so I mean, that would suggest then that we wouldn't see any sort of transaction or any other outcome happen with respect to yourselves and Sirius until we've already been through some a lot of these maturities happening over the next couple of years, is that the right way to interpret that? Gregory B. Maffei No, I think there's more flexibility in the balance sheet than you suggested. Bryan Kraft  Evercore Partners Okay. Gregory B. Maffei Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong  Macquarie Thanks. Can you just elaborate on some of the acquisitions and partnerships you're talking about with Starz and maybe just update us on your digital initiatives? And also, is there the potential for you to bump up the buyback post at the Starz spinoff? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei I can't comment on any potential acquisitions or anything, because we are not in a structure yet to even be able to contemplate that and obviously there are restrictions around kinds of things that we can do. Our digital initiatives, we did talk about the fact that we are launching our authenticated platforms, sometimes commonly referred to as TV Everywhere, and those will be launched to multiple devices at the end of the year. We certainly look to our current distributors and think that there are still plenty of opportunities with their high-speed platforms and other things that they can do that would be potential growth opportunities for Starz. And I forgot what's your last question was. I'm sorry. Christopher W. Shean  It's about buyback and maybe I'll step on that one in a second. Look, we have bought back something like 45% of the stock of Liberty Media over the 40% plus from the Liberty capital base since we've spun some of these things out. So I think we've been very aggressive on buyback and we remain so. You'll now have a case where Starz will have not only its own conservative capitalization but a large free cash flow element to make decisions about how it wants to do share purchase. So I think we found that separating assets and allowing greater transparency, less opaqueness into those, allows us in many cases to make decisions, and has accelerated buyback where appropriate, but that will really be price dependent on what's happening in those respective stocks. Amy Yong  Macquarie Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Tony Wible with Janney. Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets Hi, on the Starz side, is it safe to assume that you'll be renewing the fixed rate deals in that 19% that's up for renewal, and if not, when do you get a chance to monetize the increase in subs you've seen on the fixed-rate subs? And then also quick housekeeping question, on Starz Media, do you have a number for revenue and also what was the operating expense number for the Starz side? Gregory B. Maffei  Okay. On the affiliate agreements, I can't comment on anything specifically other than to say that the majority of the fixed rate agreements have built-in increases year-over-year. We have been negotiating with a large consignment distributor for a long time and are looking forward to putting ourselves in a position to grow that side of our business as well. So the fixed rate and consignment businesses while different, I think are both proceeding along with our expectations. With regard to the Starz Media businesses, let me just grab this, our distribution business for the three months ended in 2012 was $76 million, and the total revenue across our businesses was $403 million. What else is it that you'd like to know? Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets We are looking for the Starz OpEx. Gregory B. Maffei  The Starz OpEx? Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets And then, I guess while you are looking for that post Christopher W. Shean  The EBITDA numbers are going to be in the by division are going to be included the 10-Q which is going to get released here later today. Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets Post split, would you expect any of those generic overhead cost to move higher or there hasn't been enough time for any kind of overlap. Gregory B. Maffei   Yes, de minimus changes. There are currently cost charges already that happened, I don't think they are going to change significantly. Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets Great, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi Investment Research. Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Question for Mr. Maffei. I can never figure if I'm the smartest or the dumbest guy on these calls. So let me go back and try this one more time.  Gregory B. Maffei I think you're the smartest, Jason. You don't worry.  Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Are you saying with this Starz transaction that you've announced today that the odds of an RMT are going down dramatically and it's more likely that you're going to consolidate SIRI in some way shape or form? Be it open market purchases, or a merger of this new entity into SIRI, is that the right take-away from your comments? Gregory B. Maffei   No. I don't know if I'd go there. I would say that an RMT in the short-term is probably not as attractive to us, meaning in the next six months or something like that, because we're probably more interested in seeing them relever and get the appropriate valuation at Sirius. We think the valuation at Sirius was likely to go up on a relevering or further levering of the Company and we probably want to participate in that.  Also we probably want as I noted to get some of our capital off the table. We have to get the 51 anyway, and as a practical matter you either get there because you brought in the marketplace or because there was some combination of assets that we put in to the mix or because they paid some kind of a dividend to their shareholders. So this is probably all stuff that is termed to share repurchase that is in the main moving towards an RMT if that's what we still chose. I haven't, I'm not saying, I'm just noting some of the conditions we are likely to get or need to get through, to get to an RMT. Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Understood. Thank you. Gregory B. Maffei   Is that helpful? Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Yep. Gregory B. Maffei   Good. Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan  Wunderlich Securities Thank you. Apart from viewing Sirius as a financial instrument, can you talk about some of the business opportunities with Barnes & Noble on the tablet side, Live Nation in particular? It looks like it's an interesting core for the company that even apart from the math on valuation and capital return and such.  And then, secondly for Chris, is the pay-TV market going to just be inherently and a lot of disequilibrium on negotiating these [tariff] agreements until OpEx has a little bit more traction, I know you're not going to comment too much on M&A, and I know your strategies are somewhat different but it almost makes sense that those two companies could be combined at some point, I mean it's sort of a superficial comment, but what's your I guess rationally steady comment? Gregory B. Maffei   Matthew, I'll take the first one. You couldn't conjure up ideas, which on the margin are helpful probably to all parties. They have sort of book talk equivalent on Sirius, why could that be a Barnes & Noble labeled book talk. They already have some special events around concerts and the like that are Live Nation related, could you imagine explaining those, yes, and I think those dialogs continue. It's usually hard even when you have 100% of all of the companies to drive synergies that don't make business sense. They sort of have to generate.  You can put people in a room together, you can suggest they ought to be helpful and cooperative, but they have to make sense to both parties. It gets harder when you own pieces of things, but I think there are dialogs that do occur, can occur on the margin. I don't think they are game changers. We haven't found that yet, but I think they are positives and I think you first have to look at the underlying value of the business sales on a standalone and then look towards the incremental capabilities, but it's only on the margin. Chris? Chris Albrecht   Certainly, Starz, Showtime, HBO, these pay-TV channels are very valuable businesses and as Greg said before, they still offer a lot of cash. I'm sure that the owners of Epix believe it's a valuable business and they're working hard to build that value. Starz is the only one of those, however, that will have this unique capital structure, which I think provides us, as I have said before with opportunities across the board. We have certainly relationships with the companies that own Epix. We talk to them about other things and we will certainly have the appropriate and hopefully smart conversations with anybody and everybody as we go forward. Matthew Harrigan  Wunderlich Securities Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Martin Pyykkonen with Wedge Partners. Martin Pyykkonen  Wedge Partners Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Two things, Greg, I guess on Live Nation, I'm curious, you've always been pretty clear and obviously results at SIRI are very strong and stable. Outside of the seasonality aspect of the concert season at Live Nation, I'm curious how you feel about where that business is being managed and especially from an EBITDA, free cash flow standpoint? Is it maximizing the potential or is it something you are interested more going forward in terms of stake, it can go up to 35% without any further Board approvals, so I'd like your thoughts on that.  And then for Chris, on the premium deals, the industry broadly has talked about this a lot, we haven't really seen first run films or current season TV, the content owners obviously have the cards on hand on that one. Netflix never came back. There's never been really multiple-tiered pricing for premium content. Should we be thinking anything is going to happen anytime soon or is this more of a longer-term wait and see as you would be right now? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei So I'll comment first on Live Nation, Live Nation announced strong results yesterday and I think we could see that they're in the middle of the transition where incremental e-commerce opportunities, incremental sponsorship opportunities, more international concert business which obviously fluctuates depending upon the season and who is touring, and lastly a major upgrade at Ticketmaster on the systems there which we're sadly in need of and we're about halfway through it. I think all of those are creating opportunity at Live, that's why we increased our stake by over 60% from just about under 15% over 25%. So we've taken a substantially larger investment in that. Where we go forward and increase it up to the allowed 35, we'll see. We don't totally want to communicate every move we're going to make but we obviously, having increased it 60%, have confidence and like what the management team is doing and like where the business is headed.  Chris Albrecht   On the Starz side, we certainly see activity and interest in I guess the three buckets of potential digital distribution of our products first by the distributors within their own footprint. They are distributors that are looking to expand beyond their own footprint and there are new distributors that certainly are seeking to come into the space.  We have to weigh all of those conversations with what's best for our business going forward. We have strong relationships with our distributors and certainly want to do the things that enhance them. At the same time, we do think that there are opportunities that are on the close horizon.  Martin Pyykkonen  Wedge Partners Okay. Thank you. Gregory B. Maffei So, I think we are done for the day. Thank you for your interest in Liberty Media and we look forward to talking to you next quarter if not sooner. Operator That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. First, I had a question about the capitalization at Starz. You said there will be an undetermined amount of cash. I was wondering if you could give us some broad parameters, now is this something you think needs a lot of cash to go out and pursue acquisitions or does it need just a limited amount of cash, because it's so cash flow positive and limited working capital needs? Gregory B. Maffei Well, I think we are going to send it out with more leverage than it currently has today. Our expectation is that we'll pay a dividend of at least $1.8 billion up to between its existing cash at Starz and the availability of the revolver. The net of that is I think that the debt level at Starz will be something on the order of 2.5 times or less when it exits. The exact numbers will be dependent on some financings we are looking at, how much cash it generates between now and year end.  But above all, our goal is to send it out well, but conservatively capitalized with flexibility under its revolver and with its cash on hand to make sure it has the opportunity to either make partnerships, as Chris noted, repurchase its stock if it doesn't trade attractively in the short-term, and have other flexibilities as needed. So, I think it's going to be set with an appropriate but conservative capitalization. Chris, would you like to add anything? Christopher W. Shean Yeah. Barton, this is Chris. I would just say that obviously this has been a very carefully considered decision, and we at Starz are very comfortable with the balance sheet as we go forward and look to have the flexibility to take advantage of the opportunities that we are confident will arise. Gregory B. Maffei If I could add one more thing, this is a high cash flow generating business, there's a lot of free cash flow, relatively few demands on that cash flow. So, we think it can carry obviously more debt than it has today. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay, all right. Thats helpful. Now, I was also wondering if you could talk a little bit about why we have yet to see a firm statement about your intentions towards Sirius. I mean you've been taking steps buying more stock Mel was on the call yesterday saying that he hasn't really heard from Liberty a clear expression of what you want to do. A number of months have passed, I'm just wondering what are you waiting for, if you can talk about, and what do you need to see to kind of decide whether you want to fish or cut bait? Gregory B. Maffei Well. I think youve seen our actions and I forget what we said, you've seen our actions, we've increased our shares, we find them, weve bought at attractive prices, we find the increased ownership and influence at Sirius rather attractive and we'll decide ultimately how we wish to proceed with that stake. Our view is that Sirius is under-leveraged and there's plenty of opportunity for share repurchase and other financial actions of the Company, which we deem as ultimately positive and being a shareholder, an increased shareholder in Sirius is a good thing. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay. Does this separation is this a hurdle you need to get through before you take more definitive steps with Sirius? Gregory B. Maffei Is what a hurdle, sorry I'm not sure Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets The separation of Liberty Media from Starz. Gregory B. Maffei No. The Starz split or more accurately, the LMCA's split away from Starz has no bearing on our impact at Sirius other than the discussion about leveraging Starz more than it is currently leveraged only provides us with more firepower, but we had plenty to begin with. Barton Crockett  Lazard Capital Markets Okay, all right. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Doug Mitchelson with Deutsche Bank. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  Thanks so much. Couple of logistical questions for Greg, and then one for Chris. Greg, just following up on that, does this change the options that you would consider for Sirius at all? For example, I think Sirius shareholders think, Sirius is cheap, I think, you think LMCA is cheap. Post STARZ spin, you could merge the two together at market and call it a day. So, it's sort of new option that I didn't think was in play before. Does that make any sense? Gregory B. Maffei Well, you don't want to foreclose any options. I still believe that Liberty Media is trading at discount to NAV. We'll see what happens over the next period whether that neutralizes out. I would note we have a lot of cash at LMCA, more after the Starz dividend up to LMCA, Liberty Media, and our history has not been to issue huge amounts of stock, because in general, we believe, viewed our stock is undervalued, believed it was worth more, and we're more likely to pursue cash transactions. Having said that, I'd note the larger point, which I made to the other question, there is a ton of liquidity at Sirius. There's not only borrowing capacity today. Our anticipation is over the next several years there generate billions of dollars shielded by the NOLs with decreasing leverage and the bulk of the CapEx necessary for the satellite launches and the like are having already been spent. So, this is going to be a huge free cash flow generator. So I think this is not a case where we look and say, we need to be conservative with our cash or their cash by issuing stock, it's quite the opposite. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  Has STARZ been tainted all with M&A discussions in the past that would limit strategic flexibility for a tax-free sale post spin? I think a lot of people think sort of six months post spin, you are free and clear unless you had prior M&A discussions in the previous two years, right? Gregory B. Maffei  I'd like to believe that Liberty and Starz management have been thoughtful about any discussions in not preventing any future options in any timeframe. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  And then just quickly for Chris, any sense of return on capital strategy that you might pursue being CEO of a publicly traded company? Chris Albrecht   At this time, we're just going to proceed with our current plan and I think as we get closer to the actual date, we'll look and see what opportunities are there. As we said, this gives us a structure, a currency, and as we said before with regard to the balance sheet, a lot of flexibility to pursue all sorts of as I refer to them value enhancing strategies. So, at this time, I don't have anything specific to say. Douglas Mitchelson  Deutsche Bank  Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Well take our next question from Ben Swinburne with MSSB. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney I think for Chris S., how much of the $1.8 billion of cash and liquid investments at end of the quarter are at Starz, LLC? Christopher W. Shean  About $1 billion. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney About $1 billion. Okay. And then for Chris A. on the Starz outlook, I don't know Chris, if you're willing to give us any sense for your distribution renewals, not necessarily by operator obviously, but just even percentages how much are up over the next two years, next four years, anyway you could put that into context?  You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have renewals coming up and that there's still this potential risk there, but any way to size that? And then, on the cost side, I think at the Investor Day, you guys commented that your Sony Disney deals, you started to benefit from maybe some lower sort of rate cards that kick in soon, any update on sort of when that are we already seeing that this year or what's the timing on that piece as well? Chris Albrecht On the second question, no, we haven't seen those. Those do not kick in this year. Those actually start to kick-in in 2013. With regard to our distributor relationships, we have probably about 19% of our business that is up for renewal in the next or I guess at the end of year, and we are obviously in active discussions all the time with our distributors, but we don't have anything specifically to comment on. Gregory B. Maffei But that's not unusual. Would you say Chris and Glenn move to sort of the normal role, we have a series of ones that come up all the time and nothing, there's not unusual load in the next six months for us. Chris Albrecht No, I mean, with the consolidation of the distribution business, that's actually a relatively small amounts considering what it could be. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Right, and then, Greg, just going back a bit to Doug's question, and thinking about whenever you guys announce a spin and then we need to ask about the next potential spin, which is just thinking about the SIRI position within new Liberty, is there a question now around timing on that option? I realize it's an option, not something that you're actually doing, but spinning out that stake and merging it in an RMT with SIRI, does that require some sort of post Starz spin cooling off period with the IRS just to think about that second spin if you guys were to move down that path? Gregory B. Maffei No, I don't think that that's the real driver. I think a consideration in our mind would be, and obviously we have announced no intent to do a Reverse Morris Trust. We've only suggested its one path. But I would note, if we pursued that path, something that would weigh on our mind is, we got the first 40% of the company for free virtually. The next 11 points have cost us well over $1 billion something if we got to 51. We would probably like to get the bait back on the 11 points. We've noted that there is flexibility in the capital structure at Sirius, there's plenty of availability for them over the next short-term to lever further and return capital to shareholders including ourselves, and whatever we did, we would be unlikely to want to spin out high basis stock, we'd probably given how much we've already shrunk Liberty Media over the last several years. Wed probably including this Starz transaction, we'd probably be wanting to get that cash back. So, that would be the biggest consideration in our minds, a major one. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Yeah. And so that was then I guess tying to what that residual Liberty would look like, which is you want to make sure it's robust, has enough cash, and there's stuff to do there beyond, I think it would just be basically the braves left if you were to go down that path? Gregory B. Maffei Well. No, there's a few other things. Live Nation, TruePosition Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney In terms of operating companies, I mean Gregory B. Maffei Barnes & Noble, TruePosition is an operating company. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Yeah. Gregory B. Maffei Yes, your point is right, we would significantly shrunk Liberty Media, still making sure that it had firepower, cash available for other investments or further investments in companies we already have stock in would be something we would probably endeavor. And again, it gets sort of against our nature to spin out full basis of cash. Benjamin Swinburne  Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Yeah. Understood. Thanks a lot. Operator Our next question comes from James Ratcliffe with Barclays Capital. James Maxwell Ratcliffe  Barclays Capital, Inc.  Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First of all, structurally and hypothetically, would it be possible to have two put transactions going simultaneously? So could you and SIRI have the new Liberty split going from the existing Liberty Corporation, at the same time, you are putting through a SIRI Reverse Morris Trust from that same current Liberty Corporate entity? Gregory B. Maffei Yeah. James, I think I just tried to answer that. I don't think that that's the driver in our minds, and the problem, the issue probably in our case is going to set the right capitalization at Sirius and make sure that we achieved what we wanted on our other objectives on that investment. That would probably be the driving issue. James Maxwell Ratcliffe  Barclays Capital, Inc.  Okay, got it. And then secondly, are there concerns for the new Liberty entity regarding the Investment Company Act? It looks like if you lose Starz, you are already getting an even a larger portion of the asset base in particular with all the new SIRI common stock in there that's actually publicly traded securities. Gregory B. Maffei  We believe that is not an issue. James Maxwell Ratcliffe  Barclays Capital, Inc.  Great, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from John Tinker with Maxim. John Tinker  Maxim Group Hi, you mentioned that in the release, you want to reserve your options with respect to Sirius and Live Nation. How are you thinking about Barnes & Noble? Gregory B. Maffei  Well, I mentioned Barnes & Noble in my comment as well. We are actually currently prevented until the pill expires at Barnes & Noble. If we so chose, we are currently prevented from increasing our stake by more than, I think, about 3.3%, so it's relatively de minimus issue, but I did mention in my comments Barnes & Noble. I don't think it was meant to ignore Barnes & Noble. It was only meant to acknowledge that's probably not given how we are currently restricted something that's on the top of the list. John Tinker  Maxim Group Just on that, one of the things I found confusing is Microsoft which I think is still intending to invest, it is launching Surface through its own stores, but it has an option to own, I would have thought, all of Barnes & Noble which would immediately get it access to far more stores. Do you have a view on how they're thinking about that? Gregory B. Maffei I think you'd have to ask the Microsoft management team that question honestly. John Tinker  Maxim Group Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Bryan Kraft with Evercore Partners. Bryan Kraft  Evercore Partners Hi, thank you. I just had a follow-up question or I guess a question on your comments, Greg, about getting the right capital structure at Sirius. I mean, given the restricted payments baskets there, I mean there is a limitation on what they can buy back in stock, are you suggesting that you think that they should pay some fairly hefty call premiums to redeem some of that debt early in order to accelerate that process? That was my first question. And then, my second question is, can you just comment on the status of your application with the FCC for transfer of de facto control of Sirius. Thanks Gregory B. Maffei  Well. I am not suggesting that they should incur undue penalties in the bond market. They can obviously do breakevens and calculations on with the relative attractive rates today versus what they have to pull in going forward. I'm really talking over the next few quarters, when some of these things become callable to different rates, and when other financing flexibility becomes available and when they continue to generate more cash, that there will be cash available for share repurchase, combination of all those things. On the second question about the FCC, we are waiting to hear back on our application for de facto control, we have not yet heard from the FCC. Bryan Kraft  Evercore Partners Okay. And just if I could follow-up on the first one, so I mean, that would suggest then that we wouldn't see any sort of transaction or any other outcome happen with respect to yourselves and Sirius until we've already been through some a lot of these maturities happening over the next couple of years, is that the right way to interpret that? Gregory B. Maffei No, I think there's more flexibility in the balance sheet than you suggested. Bryan Kraft  Evercore Partners Okay. Gregory B. Maffei Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong  Macquarie Thanks. Can you just elaborate on some of the acquisitions and partnerships you're talking about with Starz and maybe just update us on your digital initiatives? And also, is there the potential for you to bump up the buyback post at the Starz spinoff? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei I can't comment on any potential acquisitions or anything, because we are not in a structure yet to even be able to contemplate that and obviously there are restrictions around kinds of things that we can do. Our digital initiatives, we did talk about the fact that we are launching our authenticated platforms, sometimes commonly referred to as TV Everywhere, and those will be launched to multiple devices at the end of the year. We certainly look to our current distributors and think that there are still plenty of opportunities with their high-speed platforms and other things that they can do that would be potential growth opportunities for Starz. And I forgot what's your last question was. I'm sorry. Christopher W. Shean  It's about buyback and maybe I'll step on that one in a second. Look, we have bought back something like 45% of the stock of Liberty Media over the 40% plus from the Liberty capital base since we've spun some of these things out. So I think we've been very aggressive on buyback and we remain so. You'll now have a case where Starz will have not only its own conservative capitalization but a large free cash flow element to make decisions about how it wants to do share purchase. So I think we found that separating assets and allowing greater transparency, less opaqueness into those, allows us in many cases to make decisions, and has accelerated buyback where appropriate, but that will really be price dependent on what's happening in those respective stocks. Amy Yong  Macquarie Okay. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Tony Wible with Janney. Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets Hi, on the Starz side, is it safe to assume that you'll be renewing the fixed rate deals in that 19% that's up for renewal, and if not, when do you get a chance to monetize the increase in subs you've seen on the fixed-rate subs? And then also quick housekeeping question, on Starz Media, do you have a number for revenue and also what was the operating expense number for the Starz side? Gregory B. Maffei  Okay. On the affiliate agreements, I can't comment on anything specifically other than to say that the majority of the fixed rate agreements have built-in increases year-over-year. We have been negotiating with a large consignment distributor for a long time and are looking forward to putting ourselves in a position to grow that side of our business as well. So the fixed rate and consignment businesses while different, I think are both proceeding along with our expectations. With regard to the Starz Media businesses, let me just grab this, our distribution business for the three months ended in 2012 was $76 million, and the total revenue across our businesses was $403 million. What else is it that you'd like to know? Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets We are looking for the Starz OpEx. Gregory B. Maffei  The Starz OpEx? Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets And then, I guess while you are looking for that post Christopher W. Shean  The EBITDA numbers are going to be in the by division are going to be included the 10-Q which is going to get released here later today. Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets Post split, would you expect any of those generic overhead cost to move higher or there hasn't been enough time for any kind of overlap. Gregory B. Maffei   Yes, de minimus changes. There are currently cost charges already that happened, I don't think they are going to change significantly. Anthony Wible  Janney Capital Markets Great, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi Investment Research. Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Question for Mr. Maffei. I can never figure if I'm the smartest or the dumbest guy on these calls. So let me go back and try this one more time.  Gregory B. Maffei I think you're the smartest, Jason. You don't worry.  Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Are you saying with this Starz transaction that you've announced today that the odds of an RMT are going down dramatically and it's more likely that you're going to consolidate SIRI in some way shape or form? Be it open market purchases, or a merger of this new entity into SIRI, is that the right take-away from your comments? Gregory B. Maffei   No. I don't know if I'd go there. I would say that an RMT in the short-term is probably not as attractive to us, meaning in the next six months or something like that, because we're probably more interested in seeing them relever and get the appropriate valuation at Sirius. We think the valuation at Sirius was likely to go up on a relevering or further levering of the Company and we probably want to participate in that.  Also we probably want as I noted to get some of our capital off the table. We have to get the 51 anyway, and as a practical matter you either get there because you brought in the marketplace or because there was some combination of assets that we put in to the mix or because they paid some kind of a dividend to their shareholders. So this is probably all stuff that is termed to share repurchase that is in the main moving towards an RMT if that's what we still chose. I haven't, I'm not saying, I'm just noting some of the conditions we are likely to get or need to get through, to get to an RMT. Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Understood. Thank you. Gregory B. Maffei   Is that helpful? Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Yep. Gregory B. Maffei   Good. Jason Bazinet  Citi Investment Research Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan  Wunderlich Securities Thank you. Apart from viewing Sirius as a financial instrument, can you talk about some of the business opportunities with Barnes & Noble on the tablet side, Live Nation in particular? It looks like it's an interesting core for the company that even apart from the math on valuation and capital return and such.  And then, secondly for Chris, is the pay-TV market going to just be inherently and a lot of disequilibrium on negotiating these [tariff] agreements until OpEx has a little bit more traction, I know you're not going to comment too much on M&A, and I know your strategies are somewhat different but it almost makes sense that those two companies could be combined at some point, I mean it's sort of a superficial comment, but what's your I guess rationally steady comment? Gregory B. Maffei   Matthew, I'll take the first one. You couldn't conjure up ideas, which on the margin are helpful probably to all parties. They have sort of book talk equivalent on Sirius, why could that be a Barnes & Noble labeled book talk. They already have some special events around concerts and the like that are Live Nation related, could you imagine explaining those, yes, and I think those dialogs continue. It's usually hard even when you have 100% of all of the companies to drive synergies that don't make business sense. They sort of have to generate.  You can put people in a room together, you can suggest they ought to be helpful and cooperative, but they have to make sense to both parties. It gets harder when you own pieces of things, but I think there are dialogs that do occur, can occur on the margin. I don't think they are game changers. We haven't found that yet, but I think they are positives and I think you first have to look at the underlying value of the business sales on a standalone and then look towards the incremental capabilities, but it's only on the margin. Chris? Chris Albrecht   Certainly, Starz, Showtime, HBO, these pay-TV channels are very valuable businesses and as Greg said before, they still offer a lot of cash. I'm sure that the owners of Epix believe it's a valuable business and they're working hard to build that value. Starz is the only one of those, however, that will have this unique capital structure, which I think provides us, as I have said before with opportunities across the board. We have certainly relationships with the companies that own Epix. We talk to them about other things and we will certainly have the appropriate and hopefully smart conversations with anybody and everybody as we go forward. Matthew Harrigan  Wunderlich Securities Thank you. Operator Our last question comes from Martin Pyykkonen with Wedge Partners. Martin Pyykkonen  Wedge Partners Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Two things, Greg, I guess on Live Nation, I'm curious, you've always been pretty clear and obviously results at SIRI are very strong and stable. Outside of the seasonality aspect of the concert season at Live Nation, I'm curious how you feel about where that business is being managed and especially from an EBITDA, free cash flow standpoint? Is it maximizing the potential or is it something you are interested more going forward in terms of stake, it can go up to 35% without any further Board approvals, so I'd like your thoughts on that.  And then for Chris, on the premium deals, the industry broadly has talked about this a lot, we haven't really seen first run films or current season TV, the content owners obviously have the cards on hand on that one. Netflix never came back. There's never been really multiple-tiered pricing for premium content. Should we be thinking anything is going to happen anytime soon or is this more of a longer-term wait and see as you would be right now? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei So I'll comment first on Live Nation, Live Nation announced strong results yesterday and I think we could see that they're in the middle of the transition where incremental e-commerce opportunities, incremental sponsorship opportunities, more international concert business which obviously fluctuates depending upon the season and who is touring, and lastly a major upgrade at Ticketmaster on the systems there which we're sadly in need of and we're about halfway through it. I think all of those are creating opportunity at Live, that's why we increased our stake by over 60% from just about under 15% over 25%. So we've taken a substantially larger investment in that. Where we go forward and increase it up to the allowed 35, we'll see. We don't totally want to communicate every move we're going to make but we obviously, having increased it 60%, have confidence and like what the management team is doing and like where the business is headed.  Chris Albrecht   On the Starz side, we certainly see activity and interest in I guess the three buckets of potential digital distribution of our products first by the distributors within their own footprint. They are distributors that are looking to expand beyond their own footprint and there are new distributors that certainly are seeking to come into the space.  We have to weigh all of those conversations with what's best for our business going forward. We have strong relationships with our distributors and certainly want to do the things that enhance them. At the same time, we do think that there are opportunities that are on the close horizon.  Martin Pyykkonen  Wedge Partners Okay. Thank you. Gregory B. Maffei So, I think we are done for the day. Thank you for your interest in Liberty Media and we look forward to talking to you next quarter if not sooner. Operator That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

On today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted OIBDA. The required definitions and reconciliations, preliminary notes and schedules 1 through 3 can be found at the end of this presentation. And with that, I'd like to introduce Liberty Media's President and CEO, Greg Maffei. Gregory B. Maffei Good morning, and thank you, and thank you all out there for joining us. Today, speaking on the call, we will have, besides myself, Liberty's CFO, Chris Shean; and Starz CEO, Chris Albrecht. And onto the highlights. At Starz, we had another strong quarter of subscriber growth. We successfully raised $500 million in 5% 7-year senior unsecured bonds. According to our underwriter, this is the lowest yield ever for a first-time issuer in a high-yield market. And we filed the Form 10 with the SEC regarding the separation of Starz, LLC and Liberty Media. We're still targeting to complete this by year end. At SiriusXM, we increased our stake in the quarter to 49.2% based on the Sirius shares that were outstanding as of 10/25. Our stake is now worth $9.1 billion based on yesterday's close. We have stated our intention to go 50% if our application for de jure control is approved by the SEC. I would note only one petition to deny was filed by one individual at the SEC, and we're pleased that the comment period is now closed. More broadly, we continue to be very pleased with the strong results that Sirius -- that they reported last week, subscribers at 23.4 million. They raised their guidance for the third time this year. Revenue was up 14%, adjusted EBITDA was up 24% and we will be heavily involved in choosing the next CEO at Sirius to continue the success there. Barnes & Noble and Microsoft completed their strategic investment in NOOK Media. And we were pleased with the delivery of the new devices at Barnes & Noble, the NOOK HD and the NOOK HD+, which started last week. Order volume is very strong. And Live Nation posted another quarter of solid results yesterday and continue to make significant progress in the social and mobile areas. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris Shean to talk about our financial results. Christopher W. Shean Thanks, Greg. Liberty Media's revenue increased 3% in the quarter to $555 million, while adjusted OIBDA increased 6% to $137 million in the third quarter. Starz, LLC's revenue increased 3% to $400 million and OIBDA increased 1% to $108 million in the quarter. Now quickly looking at liquidity. At quarter end, Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $1.2 billion and debt of $541 million. And with that, we'll have Chris Albrecht comment on Starz. Chris Albrecht Thank you, Chris, and good morning. For those who didn't join us at last month's Liberty investor event in New York, let me reiterate how excited we are about the upcoming spinoff. We believe that as an independent company, we're in a strong position to capitalize on opportunities and potential alliances in the marketplace. Now as to our third quarter financial performance, we're pleased to hit new records of 20.8 million Starz subscribers and 34.3 million Encore subscribers. Each channel was up 100,000 from last quarter, despite the third quarter typically being a slow one for the premium category in terms of sequential subscriber growth. The combined 55.1 million subscriber benchmark remains an industry high for a pair of flagship premium channels. Revenue from Starz channels for the third quarter remained relatively flat as compared to the corresponding prior year period, as an $8 million increase due to higher effective rates for the Starz Channels services was offset by a $9 million decrease. This decrease was due primarily to the nonrenewal of the Netflix agreement, which was partially offset by growth in the average number of subscriptions for our Starz and Encore channels. Revenue from Starz Distribution increased $13 million or 21% compared to the corresponding period last year. The growth was primarily attributable to strong home video performance for Spartacus: Vengeance and strong home video and digital sales for AMC Network's The Walking Dead. We look forward to distributing titles from the theatrical slate of The Weinstein Company, including Lawless, The Master, Silver Linings Playbook, Killing Them Softly and Django Unchained, which bode well for the Anchor Bay and Starz digital businesses in 2013 and beyond. The recent launches of STARZ PLAY and ENCORE PLAY, our authenticated online offerings with Cox Communications, have progressed well. The new TV Everywhere services have been well received by our key distributors, and we're in advanced stages of discussion for future launches. The PLAY services are an important addition to our premium service offerings as they fortify the brands and the underlying experience associated with subscriptions to Starz, Encore and MoviePlex. We're aggressively developing additional device support and new features and functionality as STARZ PLAY gains more traction in the marketplace. With the addition of Cox, we're now in front of about 70% of all U.S. multichannel households, primarily through our distributors' own proprietary platforms. As you may recall, we made comments on our last call about the challenging operating environment that independent programmers face in renewal discussions with various distributers. Recently, we renegotiated one of our key affiliation agreements with a new multiyear, multi-platform extension, and we also have agreement on the substantive financial terms for a multi-year extension with another distributor. The extended agreements, however, are generally on less favorable economic terms than the previous agreements. The extensions provide us with distribution stability with these distributors over the next several years and, after an initial reduction in revenue, provide for annual increases beginning on the first anniversary following the date of the extensions for each respective agreement. I believe that at Starz, we have the right content strategy in place that will differentiate us among premium content providers, coupled with our strong slate of exclusive feature film content and quality library content. We're well positioned to grow our subscriber base. Let me provide you with a taste of what we have in store on originals. We eagerly await the fourth installment of what has become our breakout hit series Spartacus, which will begin its final season on January 25. Steven DeKnight, Rob Tapert and team have wrapped production on a fitting, and no doubt bloody, conclusion to this great global franchise.  As part of our overall deal with DeKnight, he will shift focus and attention over to Incursion, a gritty science fiction drama series following soldiers, who are fighting a war against an alien race on another planet. The next new STARZ Originals Series is from the cowriter of the Dark Knight movie trilogy, David Goyer. Da Vinci's Demons will debut in the spring of next year following Spartacus. Starz owns full multi-platform rights for the series in the U.S. and English-speaking Canada, and is the first project to arise out of our partnership with BBC Worldwide. Season 2 of our wholly-owned series Magic City, which stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Danny Houston and Olga Kurylenko, is currently in production and has added legendary Academy Award nominee James Caan. Magic City continues to make inroads with audiences and has gained considerable traction in the international marketplace. Magic City was also the showcase Starz series that headlined our recently announced content distribution agreement with HBO Nordic, leveraging our library of owned and acquired TV and movie product in addition to future STARZ Originals series. HBO Nordic is a model for optimal monetization of the Starz content portfolio. Also, in 2013, we'll premiere the series The White Queen, based on the international best-selling novel The Cousins' War by Philippa Gregory. Starz has secured most global rights to the property. And of course, we have the potential third season of Boss. Next year, we begin production on Black Sails, which is filmmaker Michael Bay's first scripted project for television. Currently in preproduction in South Africa, Starz retains full global multi-platform rights for the series. Interest in buzz for Black Sails was particularly strong during last month's MidCom Conference. I'm also pleased to announce in this call a newly secured development project from our partners at Sony Television. The historical fantasy series Outlander will be written by Rob Moore and is based on the best-selling, award-winning series of novels by Diana Gabaldon. First-run output films are looking especially strong in 2012 and early 2013. The upcoming pay television premieres of the blockbuster hits The Amazing Spider-Man, Men in Black 3 and 21 Jump Street, from Sony, and Disney Pixar's Brave represent but a few of the titles debuting exclusively on Starz. Our output agreements with Disney extended the pay TV windows into 2016 and Sony into 2017, running exclusively on our family of Starz and Encore channels and services through early 2018 and '19, respectively. Thank you, and now I'll turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory B. Maffei Thank you. We are excited about the progress we made during the quarter and what's coming ahead. We have -- are excited about the potential separation -- or the separation, which we expect to occur prior to year end. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. But first, let's handle a few questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division A couple of questions. First, just with the relationship between Liberty and SIRI, who's leading the process for the search for new CEO at SIRI and what would you guys look for in that new CEO? And around that as well, any comment around the process and timing that SIRI might institute a share repurchase would be helpful. That's the first area of questions. Gregory B. Maffei So there is a committee of the board comprised of 3 members, of which I am the Chairman of that committee. And we're just beginning undertaking the search, including hiring a search firm and the like, but I think there's a deep management team to sustain the success of SiriusXM. We're both looking at internal and external candidates for the CEO job. As far as the timing of any share repurchase, I think the board will surely have on its agenda for the coming meeting return of capital, but there's no plans that have been announced or agreed to by the board. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Any sort of timing on CEO that you can give us? Is it sort of a 1-month, 3-month, 5-month process? Gregory B. Maffei I think, for the caliber of the person you're talking about, unlikely to be a 1-month process. I would hope it would be 6 or less. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Okay, fair enough. And then on the comments around Starz Distribution and lower pricing, is there any further comments you can make around that? Can you give us a sense of percent of distribution that's locked in the next couple of years? Anything that will help us try to model revenue going forward would be appreciated. Gregory B. Maffei Yes, I can't comment on the specifics of any deal, but I think in our last call, we talked about 19% of our business that's up for renewal in the next year. And with the agreements that I discussed, we have taken care of the vast majority of that. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division And so should we start thinking about sort of that impact of the increases from older contracts plus the impact of new contracts just sort of nets out and we should look at revenue growth tied to subscriber growth? Is that a fair way to look at it? Chris Albrecht Revenue growth ties to subscriber growth. Well, we have flat -- we have some fixed rate deals that have some built-in increases, and we have consignment deals. So depending on where the growth comes from depends on the effect of the revenue. But aside from the fact that I can't forecast the future, that's the best that I can do with any discussions of how our subscriber business might progress. Like I said, we feel good about our strong programming lineup and our ability to grow our services. Operator And we'll go next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley, Research Division Just a quick update on the tax side, Greg. I think you mentioned at the analyst day that there's some capital loss carryforwards at Starz and just want to see if they were still there, if those plan to utilize before the Liberty spin. And for Chris Albrecht, here's at least one vote for a third season of Boss.  You can put that in the ledger. I was curious on your visibility on the cost side. Sony, as you mentioned, has had one of their better years this year and I think you benefited at Starz over the last several years from a smaller slate at Disney and Sony since there is some relationship between box office and your cost structure on the output side. How does that -- what does that tell you about sort of the 2013 expense outlook for Starz? Do we expect to see costs go up now that Sony has had a successful year and Disney seems to be sort of stabilizing their slate? Chris Albrecht Yes, no, go ahead, Greg. I'm sorry. Gregory B. Maffei The tax losses related -- some of those are related to the Starz Media transaction, a partnership we did. We expect to liberate those and utilize them at Liberty Media prior to the completion of the Starz spin or spin away from Starz because there are no capital gains items at Starz to shield. So it's more logical to use them to shield gains that we have embedded at Liberty Media. And I expect that will be done prior to the completion of the spend, therefore prior to year end. Chris Albrecht Yes, with regard to the Sony costs, I can't provide any numbers on what our movie costs will be. We are transitioning into what's an extension period from a previous Sony deal. And as I stated before, we'd look to help fund some of our originals growth from some savings there, but, of course, given there's a 2013 release that hits us in 2014, so depending on whether you're talking about a slate or whether you're talking -- the release slate or whether you're talking about the movies that come to Starz, the timing of that is consistently being changed by the studio. And aside from the fact that I can't give you those numbers, it's also very difficult to predict. Operator And we'll hear next from James Ratcliffe from Barclays. James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division To follow up on the Starz contracts, was there any of that impact in 3Q? And also, just for accounting purposes, is this going to be handled straight line with the new contracts or actually on a cash basis? And I guess second on, Chris, on your programming deals, one asset you have is the blocking rights on digital, in particular between your first and second window. What are your thoughts about prospects to monetize that or your willingness to waive some of those restrictions in exchange for better deals? Chris Albrecht I'm sorry, could you repeat the second part of the question? James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division The -- your monetization of the rights you have to essentially block distribution of some of the movie content between the first and second window you have. Chris Albrecht Okay, well, there is no impact in Q3 is the answer to the first part of your question. With regard to -- I mean, I can't comment on the specifics of the negotiations of our deals with the studios. We are in discussions with our studio partners all the time and are certainly interested in exploring the opportunity to extend our deals with them. In those conversations, all sorts of things come up, price, rights, you can imagine. Operator And we will go next to John Tinker with Maxim. John Tinker - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division Two quick questions. One, could you just discuss a little more how you think the relationship between Barnes & Noble and Microsoft might emerge other than just putting money in? And is there any -- do you have any view still on the timing of the spinoff for the NOOK? And then secondly, could you just -- everyone talks about the buybacks of companies that you're invested in. Could you just talk a little more about Liberty and how you see your capital structure going forward, given you mentioned you'd like to have $4.5 billion of liquid assets? Chris Albrecht So on Microsoft and B&N, I think that's an expanding partnership and certainly, Barnes & Noble aims to make it an expanding partnership, growing the bookstore around the world and expanding it on the Windows platform. That's the nascent days, but I think there's a lot of upside to both parties. And I think the initiatives that Barnes & Noble is likely to have in education and in the eBook area are going to be very appealing for Microsoft. That's something they want to get closer to over time. That's certainly Barnes & Noble's goal, and I believe that will be Microsoft's goal as well. As far as buybacks at Liberty parent, Liberty Media, frankly, it's going to be a little more opportunistic going forward will be my guess. We'll be in a mode where while we do have quite a lot of liquidity, we will have no cash flow generating asset. We've had even through this period Starz, which has been generating cash to us. We will be basically holding a series of stakes, which, while we have significant influence in many cases like Sirius, like Live Nation or Barnes & Noble, we don't actually get access to their cash flows without dividends or the like or share repurchase. So I suspect it'll be more opportunistic and we'll look at that and we'll look at how we trade on a discount to sum of the parts. We've had discounts as wide as, I don't know, 35% or something and our discount has tightened over the last years. It varies, but it has generally tightened, and we'll see what happens once we get the Starz spin done, how that discount goes, but my guess is it'll tighten further, which will make us at least be thoughtful about share repurchase, if not slower. Operator And we'll hear next from Tom Eagan with Canaccord Capital. Thomas W. Eagan - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division Could you give us some detail on the economics of the deal with the BBC? For example, how much again are we going to be -- what the -- how much of the funds are we going to be getting from the BBC? What portion of the spending is going to be on your balance sheet? And then I have a follow-up. Chris Albrecht It's not a fund with the BBC, but it really depends on the programming mix. I mean, right now, we're trying to maximize our original programming spend, while at the same time help grow our distribution businesses, so we're trying to find the balance between our investment in worldwide rights against the opportunity to have partners who help offset the cost of the program in exchange for them holding on to those rights. So in the dialogue or in the script that I laid out before, I think we have a balance of those different choices. And going forward, I would expect us to maintain a balance. But it's difficult to predict how many more projects or how soon with the BBC will see them come to fruition. Douglas D. Mitchelson - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Right. I guess -- I thought I remember that they're going to be funding or sourcing about 50% of the cost of a new series. Chris Albrecht Yes, that's also based on the cost of the series. Thomas W. Eagan - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division Right. Okay. And then secondly, could you give us a sense of what the margin profile at Starz might be post spin? I know that you've added some executives over the past couple of weeks. Is there any reason to think that the Starz margin should be materially different than what it is right now? Chris Albrecht Well, first, on the execs piece, we haven't added any execs. We've replaced some execs, and we're very mindful of what our overhead is on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis. So -- and with regard to the margins, I don't think that I can comment on that, other than to say that we are looking forward to a growth business for Starz. But I don't think -- I think we can say there's no substantive incremental costs being added that are going to change the margin. It will be the direction of the business driving it. The separation itself will not add significant cost. Operator And we'll hear next from Barton Crockett with Lazard Capital Markets. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division I wanted to probe a little bit more on these new deals that you struck. Have we set a benchmark that could result in the remaining 81% of distribution contracts coming down in price somewhat closer to what this 19% where that's been negotiated over some number of years? Chris Albrecht Bart, I don't know how to answer a question like that. Every deal is different. We are a value product by our distributors, and we look for this spin to give us an opportunity to help navigate our business with a little bit more flexibility than we've had in the past, and I think that will aid us in our decisions moving forward. But it's not -- certainly, we don't have the ability to predict what distributors will or will not make -- may request of us. As I said, these deals that we've had that we've just completed take care of most of the outstanding deals that we needed to get done in the near future. So certainly, there isn't anything that I can foresee from where I sit right now. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division Okay. And then a question about the numbers. In the income statement you guys provided us, there's a  $1,281,000,000 share on earnings of affiliates. I was wondering if you could kind of update us, since that's as big number, what that was about. Christopher W. Shean Yes, this is Chris. What that is, is we do equity accounting on our Sirius investment. They removed a valuation allowance on their NOLs and recognized a big tax benefit. And that is us pulling our share of that through the P&L. Likewise, there's a big movement in deferred taxes that solely relates or principally relates to that equity pickup. Barton E. Crockett - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division But it's all noncash. Christopher W. Shean Correct. Gregory B. Maffei It's reminiscent of when we took the big gain on News Corp. with the DIRECTV. It's kind of being one of these flow-through deals. Operator And we'll hear next from Tony Wible with Janney. Anthony Wible - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division I was wondering if you guys could go into whether or not there's any restrictions on any kind of mergers or opportunities you guys see with Starz post spin? And I guess playing off of Barton's question, are there any specific host-favored nation clauses in existing agreements that would cause the new, I guess, rate card to carry over to another deal? Gregory B. Maffei Well, this is Greg, I'll comment. We don't anticipate there's anything in our structures that would prohibit us from pursuing partnerships or other kinds of opportunities post the spin. Whereas consequently, we don't comment on the terms of any individual deals, of MSN or other clauses. Operator And we'll hear next from Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division Firstly, you've shown a lot of sensitivity on price on the Liberty Interactive call and your discussion just now on buying in the Liberty Media shares. I think it's fairly evident that you're going to run a serious stock price a lot if you have the scale of buybacks to extract your full incremental capital investment. Is this another mechanism for doing that? Is it possible you could do a dividend instead? Or is there some other way to do that? And then secondly, I guess, for Chris, when you look at Incursion and Vlad that sort of appeals to the adolescent and all of us but also seems marvelously marketable for international markets as far as the economics go. If you're able to do something more significant internationally, could you possibly get to even more than 50 hours of original programming or maybe do it a little bit faster without having a cash bleed along the way? Gregory B. Maffei Well, this is Greg, and I'll comment on the first one. I think we've been discussing for several months that a dividend is certainly a potential method of return of capital for all the benefit of our shareholders in Sirius, and I think that's on the table and something that we and the Sirius board will look at hard. Chris Albrecht On the programming side, certainly, with regard to most of what we have developed and are putting into production, we look for them to be big tent-pole-type series that could have great international appeal, and our ability to monetize that will definitely affect our ability to continue to invest in programming. We think that the 50-hour number is a good one from a mix of our theatricals and originals and also, our ability to market them effectively with our distribution partners. But certainly, if there is an opportunity to grow either more quickly or with more critical mass, we'll certainly take a look at that. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division I can't resist asking this, even though I know it doesn't make too much difference in your stock price. Is Boss actually a little hamstrung internationally because there's such a New York collar [ph] component to it or does it not really matter? Chris Albrecht Well, Boss is owned and distributed by Lionsgate, so we don't have the rights to that. You better question -- ask for them. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Liberty Media Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. Gregory B.

Is this another mechanism for doing that? Is it possible you could do a dividend instead? Or is there some other way to do that? And then secondly, I guess, for Chris, when you look at Incursion and Vlad that sort of appeals to the adolescent and all of us but also seems marvelously marketable for international markets as far as the economics go. If you're able to do something more significant internationally, could you possibly get to even more than 50 hours of original programming or maybe do it a little bit faster without having a cash bleed along the way? Gregory B. Maffei Well, this is Greg, and I'll comment on the first one. I think we've been discussing for several months that a dividend is certainly a potential method of return of capital for all the benefit of our shareholders in Sirius, and I think that's on the table and something that we and the Sirius board will look at hard. Chris Albrecht On the programming side, certainly, with regard to most of what we have developed and are putting into production, we look for them to be big tent-pole-type series that could have great international appeal, and our ability to monetize that will definitely affect our ability to continue to invest in programming. We think that the 50-hour number is a good one from a mix of our theatricals and originals and also, our ability to market them effectively with our distribution partners. But certainly, if there is an opportunity to grow either more quickly or with more critical mass, we'll certainly take a look at that. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities Inc., Research Division I can't resist asking this, even though I know it doesn't make too much difference in your stock price. Is Boss actually a little hamstrung internationally because there's such a New York collar [ph] component to it or does it not really matter? Chris Albrecht Well, Boss is owned and distributed by Lionsgate, so we don't have the rights to that. You better question -- ask for them. Operator And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's Liberty Media Corporation Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. Gregory B. Maffei Thank you all for joining, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. Gregory Maffei  Thank you and good morning. Today, speaking on the call, besides myself, we'll have Liberty's CFO, Chris Shean. During the Q&A, we'll also take questions on Liberty Broadband, as it will not have its own separate call. Note, that in a new practice, we are not distributing slides to accompany the call today because all of the material on those slides that we historically had is referenced in the morning's press release. So first, looking at Liberty Media. We continued our buybacks during the quarter and repurchased a total of $208 million worth of LMCA and LMCK shares from May 1 through the end of July. That fully utilized all the funds distributed in conjunction with the LBRD spin-off, but I would note that the board of directors also increased the buyback authorization at Liberty Media by an incremental $1 billion. We have noticed, as I suspect some of you on the call have, that the discount from the NAV at Liberty Media has expanded. Some analysts have the discount anywhere from the low to the high teens, and some have even imagined higher numbers. Depending on how you look at it, that discount is potentially below the value of just our publicly traded series shares. And so you're either getting everything else for free or at least very cheap. We have noticed it as well, as I said, and are thinking of ways and considering ways to take advantage of that discount. On to some of our operational highlights. First at Sirius, they reported truly outstanding results, increasing subscribers to 28.4 million, adding 692,000 net new subscribers, up 46% from the adds in the second quarter of 2014. They recorded a churn of 1.6%. That's the lowest churn rate since the merger in 2008. Revenue grew 8% to $1.12 billion. Adjusted EBITDA grew 12% to a record $415 million. And because they continue to have an active share repurchase program, Liberty's ownership stake stood at 59.4% as of July 24, when they reported the number. Altogether, a pretty outstanding quarter. Live Nation will report next week on Monday, so I'm somewhat limited in my ability to communicate on their progress during the quarter. I would note, however, that they had continued momentum on festivals in North America and globally. They announced the formation of Live Nation Concerts Germany earlier this week. That partnership with Marek Lieberberg, the fifth largest promoter in the world, will add over 700 new shows and 2 million fans to the LYV platform. They also announced a new TV event, Live Nation Music Awards, which will air on the first of October. And last, looking at the Liberty Media assets, major assets, the Braves, our stadium and mixed-use real estate project, progresses well. Cobb County's financing cleared the latest legal hurdle in our stadium bond financing will proceed as planned. We've agreed upon terms with the hotel partner for our mixed-use space, and we're working with incremental partners on the entertainment venue. Looking at the club itself, it's re-tooled the organization at all levels via free agent signings and trades in exchange for prospects and draft picks. We've added veterans like Gomez, and at the end of July we completed a 13-player trade with the Dodgers and Marlins. I'd also note, we extended the contract of Fredi Gonzalez through 2016, with an option for 2017. Turning now to Broadband. Charter's second quarter results continued to demonstrate the success of their strategic focus on delivering a superior service at competitive prices. Residential customers were up 34,000. Residential high-speed data customers were up 70,000, a 43% increase year-over-year. Revenue was up an industry-leading 7.6% year-over-year. EBITDA grew 6.8% and, excluding some transaction costs related to our upcoming merger with Time Warner, would have been up 8.9% year-over-year. Truly impressive numbers. We at Liberty Broadband remain excited about Charter, Time Warner Cable and the Bright House transactions and our incremental investments. With a transaction blended reference price for Charter at about $176.40 in Charter, though it bounced around a little this morning having traded over $190. We find this incremental investment by Liberty Broadband to be very appealing. And we'd note, our revenue estimates driven primarily by subscribers and ARPU are similar to those described in the Charter proxy. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Chris Shean to talk about our financial results. Christopher Shean  Thanks, Greg. Given our ownership of over 50% of SiriusXM, as we have said in previous quarters, they are consolidated in our financial statements. They are the dominant component of our financial statements. But for analysts' analysis purposes of SiriusXM, we would recommend going directly to their filings, which are on their website and in publicly filed document places. At quarter-end, Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $841 million and principal amount of debt of $6.7 billion, which includes $5.2 billion of debt at SiriusXM and a margin loan at Liberty. Included in the $841 million of cash and liquid investments balance at June 30 is $294 million held at SiriusXM. Liberty's cash and liquid investments, excluding cash held at SiriusXM, was $547 million. Now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg. Gregory Maffei   Thanks, Chris. And to the audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Media. And with that, operator, I would open the call for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. One moment for your first question, please. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, none on the Braves, although, the Mets are making moves. I wanted to ask you about the music business. Greg, you've talked about focusing in on opportunities there at Liberty Media/SIRI. I'm wondering if the CRB process that's coming at the end of this year around streaming rights impacts, how you think about the opportunities. In other words, if that breaks one way or the other, does that make things more or less interesting for you on the technology side? And just any other color maybe around Vivendi or any other things you think you could do that might be interesting to create value? And then I just had one quick follow-up. Gregory Maffei Sure. Well, we run today a very attractive music service, which is distributed with other exclusive content and more broad content, audio content, on satellite and through streaming. One of the questions in my mind, and I think the mind of the Sirius management, is over time how much of an opportunity do we have to extend that [technical difficulty] by moving to a younger demographic, a mobile demographic, and an international demographic, one that is less driven by the car and into other devices, though it may also include the car. Most of the businesses that we've looked at in that space have had, in some cases, interesting growth of subscribers or users, in many cases, not paid subscribers but free users, but have had very or relatively unattractive economics given their cost of content and their ability to monetize it. And that's true both of some of the ones that are ad-supported and some of the ones that are more subscription oriented. So we've looked at all of those businesses, many of which have been available for sale or investment. And we remain interested, but not yet convinced how to play it. And we've looked at everything, as I said, from partnership to investment to acquisition. We are very lucky to be at the most attractive part of the monetization in terms of our ability to monetize audio content, older audiences in the car in the U.S. Question is how much opportunity is there for us outside those markets. Benjamin Swinburne Got it. And then just, I'm sure there are things we aren't aware of around complexities here. So I'm wondering if you could help educate us. There is a lot of people who wonder why not have Sirius buy LMCA, LMCK shares because they're essentially buying their own stock at a discount, and their numbers are obviously quite strong. What are the reasons, beyond maybe just optics, that that's going to be more complicated than we all think? Gregory Maffei Well, I think that's something probably more to be addressed because obviously we have some conflicts issues around that, the SiriusXM management team. I can tell you, I don't think I'm giving away any confidence as that idea has been discussed both by Liberty and by Sirius. There is some logic and appeal to that. I think one of the questions for them would be what's their eventual liquidity path on those shares and how do they eventually collapse that. If you imagine an impending merger, which we tried once between Liberty and SiriusXM, then that solves the problem, but that's not guaranteed. So that's why they might be reluctant. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Vijay Jayant Thanks. I've got a couple questions. So, Greg, you were talking about opportunities and how you could probably close the discount apart from Sirius buying back Liberty stock. Can you talk about other strategies? Is there an opportunity to sell Sirius stock and buy back Liberty Media stock as a way to close? I mean, can you just talk about that? And second, on Liberty Broadband again, really putting the cart before the horse here, but you've got a proxy to get to 25% as part of this transaction. So should we be expecting, once the transaction closes, that Charter's going to be a big buyer of the stock and, given you wouldn't be a seller, that your ownership gets above 25% in five years? So that's the way it sort of plays out? Thanks. Gregory Maffei So I'll address the issues around the discount. I think, first, I'll comment, and we all have our potential observations on why the discount exists, I would note it got as tight as 2% when we had a more complicated company in the sense that Charter, now Liberty Broadband, shares were inside of Liberty Media. The discount tightened about 15 months ago to 2% and now it's widened certainly to the mid to high teens. That seems illogical. There are two potential explanations I can come up with. I'm sure there are others, but two that seem most likely to me. One is the fact that SiriusXM has been repurchasing shares at a larger percentage of its float than we have as of ours, probably creating, if not artificial, more upward pressure on their stock than on our stock. And second, the expectation that we might be [technical difficulty] discounted currency and in a negative cycle pay more for the stock of SiriusXM with a discounted Liberty currency. I've noted we're thinking about ways to attack both of those, but I can at least jawbone the second part and say we're not going to do that. I think if you looked at our history, we've shown patience. SiriusXM is repurchasing at an aggressive rate already and increasing our ownership every day and doing it at no premium. And so why we would go and spend our valuable currency, which is trading at a discount, and pay a significant premium? It seems like an illogical path and one that we probably won't pursue. If you need a witness on that, look at what we've done with HSN where when the stock was weak, we bought more, we bought right up to our limit, and we have not pursued with a relatively less valued, in our judgment, QVC currency and an acquisition of that. So that's more an observation. There are a lot of financing techniques we can use to look at to tighten this. But the reality is we are long-term holders and to the degree the discount gets big enough, we'll treat it as an opportunity to buy, not something that needs to be jawboned. On Liberty Broadband, I can't project, because you are jumping a little bit ahead, but if you look at most of the projections  I can't forecast rather, but if you look at the projections put forward in the proxy, you'll note that the company significantly de-levers based on the cash flows generated post the Time Warner and Bright House transactions. And I would expect that, all things being equal, Charter has shown an ability and a desire to maintain relatively higher rates of leverage than our forecast there. And the logical way, assuming no other acquisitions, would become some level of share repurchase and that might lead to our increasing our stake. Alternatively, we've shown an ability, as witnessed by the transactions that we announced back in May, an ability to find capital, people will invest alongside us in Liberty Broadband. And if that was a way to increase our stake, we could go that way as well. But I'm not sure that will be necessary. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan Thank you. I actually have a Braves question. You had a big announcement with MLB Advanced Media yesterday and NHL that sort of looks interesting on the sports streaming side. How do you think that really affects the sports market longer term? And when you think of the value of the Braves, it's always been kind of a set piece value off Forbes or whatever, and obviously all of us are aware of the issues on the TV rights and all that. Is that something you think could actually have a pretty wide collar with a lot of upside, depending on how circumstances play out? Thank you. Gregory Maffei Yeah, Matthew, look, I think you first have to tip your hand to the job that Bob Bowman and the BAM team have done in building an unbelievable platform. Some people look at baseball as the less advanced, more the stodgy old guys, and the reality is on the technology side, the digital side, they're ahead of all the other major sports and have taken advantage of that technology, not only to build a great business for themselves, but to provide the technology to third parties, including people like HBO. Now they've taken the next step and potentially are looking at not just distributing other people's rights for them, but owning those rights and building a broader service. I think that's something that's very appealing. It could potentially be the effect, if not completely the Netflix of sports, in some sort of subscription service, and it's something that accrues quite a lot of value to the owners of baseball. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft, Deutsche Bank. Bryan Kraft Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions, I guess, Greg, following up on Vijay's question on Liberty Media and the discount. For some of the smaller stakes, do you think there's an embedded tax liability on some of those stakes that's driving the discount? And can you talk about what tax assets or offsets you have that we should be thinking about that could shield any of that potential tax leakage? And then I had one after that on the Broadband side, if you don't mind. Gregory Maffei Sure. Well, one could certainly  I think that's a fair guess, and I wouldn't claim to have a crystal ball on all the reasons for the discount. I try and point out the market's lack of respect for us on that. Our history has been not to find those or liquidate those assets other than in a tax efficient manner. I think we noted that we did get some liquidity on some of our smaller stakes during the first half of this year, all in a tax efficient manner. I don't think we're going to tip our hand to all of the potential future attributes we have on the tax side, but I think it's fair to say we will find ways to liquidate those over time in a more tax-efficient manner. Or, if we do it in a way that is tax inefficient, it's because we find the need for the capital and the reason for investing the capital pretty damn compelling. i.e. if we found exactly the right opportunity, might we do something? Sure, but it'd have to be a heck of an investment. So I don't think we're going to do something that's tax irrational, that's not been our history. Bryan Kraft Okay, great. And then on the Broadband side, I had two questions, I guess. One, just wondering how you think about Altice as a potential competitor for additional cable acquisitions? And then also, I was wondering, just on the Starz side. I mean given how Starz is trying to be sort of a bigger friendly premium network to the cable industry and your ownership of Charter, are you trying to sort of cultivate more of a working relationship there? Do you think that there's an opportunity for Starz and Charter to do something that's innovative that could be value-added for both sides? Gregory Maffei So first on Altice, I think you have to give your pat to Patrick Drahi and Dexter Goei, how they've done a heck of a job rolling up the things that they've done. One may argue or contest some of the prices they paid; they certainly pushed us perhaps a little bit higher on Time Warner than we would have liked. But you have to say they're acting quite rationally given the power of their currency and the model that they've developed and their ability to find cheap financing. So I think that they're a fearsome competitor, and I tip my hat to both of them. Could they be a competitor for future acquisitions? We've got kind of two big ones on the table right now, so we're not exactly looking at the future ones. We'd like to get these two cleared. But you have to tip your hand for what they've done both in Europe, Latin America and here in the U.S. On the question around Starz, I think there is a lot of potential for Starz to be, if not the house brand, a more friendly brand to cable MSOs. Why? We're not pulling a long chain of other channels. We have acted quite friendly in terms of removing our Netflix relationship. We've acted friendly in terms of investing in content that we think has demand and is valuable. And I'd love to see, and I think, Chris Albrecht would too, us do more with all of the cable MSOs and particularly Charter, given our relationship. I think that's possible and I think it would be beneficial to both parties. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Thomas William Eagan ...on the changing negotiating leverage between the cable operators and the programmers. While the operators may have more leverage if the programmers... Gregory Maffei You were cut off on the first part of that. I didn't hear you. Could you start from the beginning of the question... Thomas William Eagan Sure. Of course. Is this better? Gregory Maffei Yeah. We missed like the first like three or four words. It like jumped into the question. I didn't hear the beginning. Thomas William Eagan Okay. Curious for your thoughts on the changing negotiating leverage between the cable operators and the programmers. So while the operators may have more leverage, if the programmers launch an over-the-top service like HBO or CBS, doesn't the operator lose that leverage if their programmer blocks access to their site to the data subs? Thanks. Gregory Maffei I think that the continuing dance between the leverage on operators and programmers is usually dependent on the strength of the programmer versus the strength of the operator. And if you have particularly strong content, you're pretty compelling. If you're an operator with a larger market share and against a smaller programmer with less powerful content, less compelling content, you probably have more leverage. The fact that more of this content is being distributed in other places does certainly tend to give more leverage to the operator because there are alternative ways to find that. Thomas William Eagan Yeah. Gregory Maffei And I think the practice of blocking broadband subscribers from open sites is really hard to see how that continues forward in the world because it seems pretty prejudicial. I'm not talking on the legal standpoint from, but certainly from any PR standpoint, an operator which decides whether a programmer would decide they can block access to that site for a certain class of customers, that's pretty prejudicial at least in public statement, if not legally. Thomas William Eagan Yeah. Gregory Maffei So we'll see how that goes. Thomas William Eagan It looks as though, in terms of the FCC waiting to start the clock on the Charter deal with Time Warner Cable, it seems as though there is some difference of opinion between the Republicans and the Democrats at the FCC. A lot of it has to do with the changing of the privacy laws on the information flow. Any thoughts on that? Gregory Maffei No. I'm going to stay away from that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong Thank you. Two questions. In the past, I think you've expressed interest in raising your stake in Live Nation. What is your appetite for that asset at this point and how do you view valuation from here on out? And then what's the latest on your litigation with Vivendi? I think it's been reported that you've looked at the Universal Music Group. Might that still be in the equation? Thank you. Gregory Maffei We think Live Nation is a great asset. I think a while ago we reported we had an open forward. We've not yet reported on any change in that, but that must speak to some degree our desire or interest in further investment in Live Nation. But obviously, as we sort of go back to my comments about SiriusXM, it's all price dependent. We try to show some discipline. And then on Vivendi, I think, put aside rumors, we'll comment directly. We have a lot of things going on with Vivendi. SiriusXM is a large consumer of its content, they have a relationship with Live. We have a judgment against them, which has not yet been affirmed. And there's potential other things we can do with Vivendi, or rather with Universal Music that are interesting. So we'll see where it goes. Operator Our next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. James Ratcliffe Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on Media and one on Broadband if I could. First of all, on Media, are there any limitations on your ability to, say, borrow against the Sirius stake should you want to, say, accelerate the buyback at LMCA, given the discount? And secondly, on Broadband, your TWC collars are pretty much in the red at this point. How do we think about what happens when the Charter-TWC deal closes? Do those roll forward or do they get paid out in cash and are there tax consequences? Thanks. Gregory Maffei Okay. So on what we can do against our borrowings, I don't think there's any legal limitations or market limitations in practicality. That's the thing that would constrain us in some way. And on Broadband, I believe we've now disclosed that we're out of those collars. Those are terminated. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Bart Crockett Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I was wanting to ask about the ownership, the creeping ownership at SIRI, as you're at 59%, I think you were at 57% last quarter. In a year or so, you'll be up pushing 70% at this pace. Now at what point do you think, Greg, it becomes incumbent upon SIRI to maybe stop buying back shares or stop buying back shares as your ownership accretes? And can you walk through some scenarios that tell us how we would get out of that situation once we get there? Gregory Maffei Well, I think that's one that you're going to have to address more to the independent directors and counsel at SIRI. It's not our challenge, per se. I would state that sheer math would say, from Liberty's perspective, if they wanted to pay a big one-time special cash dividend because they got too high on the buyback and remembering our discount at LMC, we wouldn't probably complain because even after the tax at the moment that we would pay on that kind of a distribution, we'd be effective at buying our own stock back and still be able to capture more value. So I think are other things they can do. Look, they're a cash flow generating machine. There are other ways they can deliver value to their shareholders at some point, if our ownership gets too high, because of liquidity concerns or other concerns. Bart Crockett Okay, great. And then one other quick thing, just a follow-up here, but there was a question about Vivendi, but where are we in the litigation process right now? Gregory Maffei I'm going to turn that over to our esteemed General Counsel, Mr. Baer. Richard Baer The matter has been fully briefed before the Second Circuit and we're waiting for the Second Circuit to set oral argument, which we hope to occur this year, and then a decision sometime in the first half of next year. Bart Crockett And the interest rate litigation... Gregory Maffei Let me remind you that there are two issues that are probably worth nothing. There are two issues on the table: the judgment, and then the interest. Bart Crockett Yes. So of course, Vivendi is attempting to overturn the judgment, but we also are appealing an issue as to what is the applicable pre-judgment interest. And the court imposed a very low interest rate and we believe, and are confident in our belief, that the New York State interest rate of 9% applies for pre-judgment interest, which has a significant impact on the overall amount we can recover. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Mike Mitchell with Locust Wood. Q - Michael Clark Mitchell Sorry, guys. Question has been answered. Thank you very much. A - Gregory Maffei Okay. I think we're done then. Operator, thank you very much. And audience, thank you very much, again, for your continued interest in Liberty Media. Hope to speak with you next quarter, if not sooner.

One moment for your first question, please. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Benjamin Swinburne Thank you. Good morning. Two questions, none on the Braves, although, the Mets are making moves. I wanted to ask you about the music business. Greg, you've talked about focusing in on opportunities there at Liberty Media/SIRI. I'm wondering if the CRB process that's coming at the end of this year around streaming rights impacts, how you think about the opportunities. In other words, if that breaks one way or the other, does that make things more or less interesting for you on the technology side? And just any other color maybe around Vivendi or any other things you think you could do that might be interesting to create value? And then I just had one quick follow-up. Gregory Maffei Sure. Well, we run today a very attractive music service, which is distributed with other exclusive content and more broad content, audio content, on satellite and through streaming. One of the questions in my mind, and I think the mind of the Sirius management, is over time how much of an opportunity do we have to extend that [technical difficulty] by moving to a younger demographic, a mobile demographic, and an international demographic, one that is less driven by the car and into other devices, though it may also include the car. Most of the businesses that we've looked at in that space have had, in some cases, interesting growth of subscribers or users, in many cases, not paid subscribers but free users, but have had very or relatively unattractive economics given their cost of content and their ability to monetize it. And that's true both of some of the ones that are ad-supported and some of the ones that are more subscription oriented. So we've looked at all of those businesses, many of which have been available for sale or investment. And we remain interested, but not yet convinced how to play it. And we've looked at everything, as I said, from partnership to investment to acquisition. We are very lucky to be at the most attractive part of the monetization in terms of our ability to monetize audio content, older audiences in the car in the U.S. Question is how much opportunity is there for us outside those markets. Benjamin Swinburne Got it. And then just, I'm sure there are things we aren't aware of around complexities here. So I'm wondering if you could help educate us. There is a lot of people who wonder why not have Sirius buy LMCA, LMCK shares because they're essentially buying their own stock at a discount, and their numbers are obviously quite strong. What are the reasons, beyond maybe just optics, that that's going to be more complicated than we all think? Gregory Maffei Well, I think that's something probably more to be addressed because obviously we have some conflicts issues around that, the SiriusXM management team. I can tell you, I don't think I'm giving away any confidence as that idea has been discussed both by Liberty and by Sirius. There is some logic and appeal to that. I think one of the questions for them would be what's their eventual liquidity path on those shares and how do they eventually collapse that. If you imagine an impending merger, which we tried once between Liberty and SiriusXM, then that solves the problem, but that's not guaranteed. So that's why they might be reluctant. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore. Vijay Jayant Thanks. I've got a couple questions. So, Greg, you were talking about opportunities and how you could probably close the discount apart from Sirius buying back Liberty stock. Can you talk about other strategies? Is there an opportunity to sell Sirius stock and buy back Liberty Media stock as a way to close? I mean, can you just talk about that? And second, on Liberty Broadband again, really putting the cart before the horse here, but you've got a proxy to get to 25% as part of this transaction. So should we be expecting, once the transaction closes, that Charter's going to be a big buyer of the stock and, given you wouldn't be a seller, that your ownership gets above 25% in five years? So that's the way it sort of plays out? Thanks. Gregory Maffei So I'll address the issues around the discount. I think, first, I'll comment, and we all have our potential observations on why the discount exists, I would note it got as tight as 2% when we had a more complicated company in the sense that Charter, now Liberty Broadband, shares were inside of Liberty Media. The discount tightened about 15 months ago to 2% and now it's widened certainly to the mid to high teens. That seems illogical. There are two potential explanations I can come up with. I'm sure there are others, but two that seem most likely to me. One is the fact that SiriusXM has been repurchasing shares at a larger percentage of its float than we have as of ours, probably creating, if not artificial, more upward pressure on their stock than on our stock. And second, the expectation that we might be [technical difficulty] discounted currency and in a negative cycle pay more for the stock of SiriusXM with a discounted Liberty currency. I've noted we're thinking about ways to attack both of those, but I can at least jawbone the second part and say we're not going to do that. I think if you looked at our history, we've shown patience. SiriusXM is repurchasing at an aggressive rate already and increasing our ownership every day and doing it at no premium. And so why we would go and spend our valuable currency, which is trading at a discount, and pay a significant premium? It seems like an illogical path and one that we probably won't pursue. If you need a witness on that, look at what we've done with HSN where when the stock was weak, we bought more, we bought right up to our limit, and we have not pursued with a relatively less valued, in our judgment, QVC currency and an acquisition of that. So that's more an observation. There are a lot of financing techniques we can use to look at to tighten this. But the reality is we are long-term holders and to the degree the discount gets big enough, we'll treat it as an opportunity to buy, not something that needs to be jawboned. On Liberty Broadband, I can't project, because you are jumping a little bit ahead, but if you look at most of the projections  I can't forecast rather, but if you look at the projections put forward in the proxy, you'll note that the company significantly de-levers based on the cash flows generated post the Time Warner and Bright House transactions. And I would expect that, all things being equal, Charter has shown an ability and a desire to maintain relatively higher rates of leverage than our forecast there. And the logical way, assuming no other acquisitions, would become some level of share repurchase and that might lead to our increasing our stake. Alternatively, we've shown an ability, as witnessed by the transactions that we announced back in May, an ability to find capital, people will invest alongside us in Liberty Broadband. And if that was a way to increase our stake, we could go that way as well. But I'm not sure that will be necessary. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan Thank you. I actually have a Braves question. You had a big announcement with MLB Advanced Media yesterday and NHL that sort of looks interesting on the sports streaming side. How do you think that really affects the sports market longer term? And when you think of the value of the Braves, it's always been kind of a set piece value off Forbes or whatever, and obviously all of us are aware of the issues on the TV rights and all that. Is that something you think could actually have a pretty wide collar with a lot of upside, depending on how circumstances play out? Thank you. Gregory Maffei Yeah, Matthew, look, I think you first have to tip your hand to the job that Bob Bowman and the BAM team have done in building an unbelievable platform. Some people look at baseball as the less advanced, more the stodgy old guys, and the reality is on the technology side, the digital side, they're ahead of all the other major sports and have taken advantage of that technology, not only to build a great business for themselves, but to provide the technology to third parties, including people like HBO. Now they've taken the next step and potentially are looking at not just distributing other people's rights for them, but owning those rights and building a broader service. I think that's something that's very appealing. It could potentially be the effect, if not completely the Netflix of sports, in some sort of subscription service, and it's something that accrues quite a lot of value to the owners of baseball. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft, Deutsche Bank. Bryan Kraft Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of questions, I guess, Greg, following up on Vijay's question on Liberty Media and the discount. For some of the smaller stakes, do you think there's an embedded tax liability on some of those stakes that's driving the discount? And can you talk about what tax assets or offsets you have that we should be thinking about that could shield any of that potential tax leakage? And then I had one after that on the Broadband side, if you don't mind. Gregory Maffei Sure. Well, one could certainly  I think that's a fair guess, and I wouldn't claim to have a crystal ball on all the reasons for the discount. I try and point out the market's lack of respect for us on that. Our history has been not to find those or liquidate those assets other than in a tax efficient manner. I think we noted that we did get some liquidity on some of our smaller stakes during the first half of this year, all in a tax efficient manner. I don't think we're going to tip our hand to all of the potential future attributes we have on the tax side, but I think it's fair to say we will find ways to liquidate those over time in a more tax-efficient manner. Or, if we do it in a way that is tax inefficient, it's because we find the need for the capital and the reason for investing the capital pretty damn compelling. i.e. if we found exactly the right opportunity, might we do something? Sure, but it'd have to be a heck of an investment. So I don't think we're going to do something that's tax irrational, that's not been our history. Bryan Kraft Okay, great. And then on the Broadband side, I had two questions, I guess. One, just wondering how you think about Altice as a potential competitor for additional cable acquisitions? And then also, I was wondering, just on the Starz side. I mean given how Starz is trying to be sort of a bigger friendly premium network to the cable industry and your ownership of Charter, are you trying to sort of cultivate more of a working relationship there? Do you think that there's an opportunity for Starz and Charter to do something that's innovative that could be value-added for both sides? Gregory Maffei So first on Altice, I think you have to give your pat to Patrick Drahi and Dexter Goei, how they've done a heck of a job rolling up the things that they've done. One may argue or contest some of the prices they paid; they certainly pushed us perhaps a little bit higher on Time Warner than we would have liked. But you have to say they're acting quite rationally given the power of their currency and the model that they've developed and their ability to find cheap financing. So I think that they're a fearsome competitor, and I tip my hat to both of them. Could they be a competitor for future acquisitions? We've got kind of two big ones on the table right now, so we're not exactly looking at the future ones. We'd like to get these two cleared. But you have to tip your hand for what they've done both in Europe, Latin America and here in the U.S. On the question around Starz, I think there is a lot of potential for Starz to be, if not the house brand, a more friendly brand to cable MSOs. Why? We're not pulling a long chain of other channels. We have acted quite friendly in terms of removing our Netflix relationship. We've acted friendly in terms of investing in content that we think has demand and is valuable. And I'd love to see, and I think, Chris Albrecht would too, us do more with all of the cable MSOs and particularly Charter, given our relationship. I think that's possible and I think it would be beneficial to both parties. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Thomas William Eagan ...on the changing negotiating leverage between the cable operators and the programmers. While the operators may have more leverage if the programmers... Gregory Maffei You were cut off on the first part of that. I didn't hear you. Could you start from the beginning of the question... Thomas William Eagan Sure. Of course. Is this better? Gregory Maffei Yeah. We missed like the first like three or four words. It like jumped into the question. I didn't hear the beginning. Thomas William Eagan Okay. Curious for your thoughts on the changing negotiating leverage between the cable operators and the programmers. So while the operators may have more leverage, if the programmers launch an over-the-top service like HBO or CBS, doesn't the operator lose that leverage if their programmer blocks access to their site to the data subs? Thanks. Gregory Maffei I think that the continuing dance between the leverage on operators and programmers is usually dependent on the strength of the programmer versus the strength of the operator. And if you have particularly strong content, you're pretty compelling. If you're an operator with a larger market share and against a smaller programmer with less powerful content, less compelling content, you probably have more leverage. The fact that more of this content is being distributed in other places does certainly tend to give more leverage to the operator because there are alternative ways to find that. Thomas William Eagan Yeah. Gregory Maffei And I think the practice of blocking broadband subscribers from open sites is really hard to see how that continues forward in the world because it seems pretty prejudicial. I'm not talking on the legal standpoint from, but certainly from any PR standpoint, an operator which decides whether a programmer would decide they can block access to that site for a certain class of customers, that's pretty prejudicial at least in public statement, if not legally. Thomas William Eagan Yeah. Gregory Maffei So we'll see how that goes. Thomas William Eagan It looks as though, in terms of the FCC waiting to start the clock on the Charter deal with Time Warner Cable, it seems as though there is some difference of opinion between the Republicans and the Democrats at the FCC. A lot of it has to do with the changing of the privacy laws on the information flow. Any thoughts on that? Gregory Maffei No. I'm going to stay away from that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong Thank you. Two questions. In the past, I think you've expressed interest in raising your stake in Live Nation. What is your appetite for that asset at this point and how do you view valuation from here on out? And then what's the latest on your litigation with Vivendi? I think it's been reported that you've looked at the Universal Music Group. Might that still be in the equation? Thank you. Gregory Maffei We think Live Nation is a great asset. I think a while ago we reported we had an open forward. We've not yet reported on any change in that, but that must speak to some degree our desire or interest in further investment in Live Nation. But obviously, as we sort of go back to my comments about SiriusXM, it's all price dependent. We try to show some discipline. And then on Vivendi, I think, put aside rumors, we'll comment directly. We have a lot of things going on with Vivendi. SiriusXM is a large consumer of its content, they have a relationship with Live. We have a judgment against them, which has not yet been affirmed. And there's potential other things we can do with Vivendi, or rather with Universal Music that are interesting. So we'll see where it goes. Operator Our next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. James Ratcliffe Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One on Media and one on Broadband if I could. First of all, on Media, are there any limitations on your ability to, say, borrow against the Sirius stake should you want to, say, accelerate the buyback at LMCA, given the discount? And secondly, on Broadband, your TWC collars are pretty much in the red at this point. How do we think about what happens when the Charter-TWC deal closes? Do those roll forward or do they get paid out in cash and are there tax consequences? Thanks. Gregory Maffei Okay. So on what we can do against our borrowings, I don't think there's any legal limitations or market limitations in practicality. That's the thing that would constrain us in some way. And on Broadband, I believe we've now disclosed that we're out of those collars. Those are terminated. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Bart Crockett Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I was wanting to ask about the ownership, the creeping ownership at SIRI, as you're at 59%, I think you were at 57% last quarter. In a year or so, you'll be up pushing 70% at this pace. Now at what point do you think, Greg, it becomes incumbent upon SIRI to maybe stop buying back shares or stop buying back shares as your ownership accretes? And can you walk through some scenarios that tell us how we would get out of that situation once we get there? Gregory Maffei Well, I think that's one that you're going to have to address more to the independent directors and counsel at SIRI. It's not our challenge, per se. I would state that sheer math would say, from Liberty's perspective, if they wanted to pay a big one-time special cash dividend because they got too high on the buyback and remembering our discount at LMC, we wouldn't probably complain because even after the tax at the moment that we would pay on that kind of a distribution, we'd be effective at buying our own stock back and still be able to capture more value. So I think are other things they can do. Look, they're a cash flow generating machine. There are other ways they can deliver value to their shareholders at some point, if our ownership gets too high, because of liquidity concerns or other concerns. Bart Crockett Okay, great. And then one other quick thing, just a follow-up here, but there was a question about Vivendi, but where are we in the litigation process right now? Gregory Maffei I'm going to turn that over to our esteemed General Counsel, Mr. Baer. Richard Baer The matter has been fully briefed before the Second Circuit and we're waiting for the Second Circuit to set oral argument, which we hope to occur this year, and then a decision sometime in the first half of next year. Bart Crockett And the interest rate litigation... Gregory Maffei Let me remind you that there are two issues that are probably worth nothing. There are two issues on the table: the judgment, and then the interest. Bart Crockett Yes. So of course, Vivendi is attempting to overturn the judgment, but we also are appealing an issue as to what is the applicable pre-judgment interest. And the court imposed a very low interest rate and we believe, and are confident in our belief, that the New York State interest rate of 9% applies for pre-judgment interest, which has a significant impact on the overall amount we can recover. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Mike Mitchell with Locust Wood. Q - Michael Clark Mitchell Sorry, guys. Question has been answered. Thank you very much. A - Gregory Maffei Okay. I think we're done then. Operator, thank you very much. And audience, thank you very much, again, for your continued interest in Liberty Media. Hope to speak with you next quarter, if not sooner.

Now I would like to introduce Greg Maffei, our President and CEO. Greg Maffei Thank you, Courtney and good afternoon to all of you out there. Today speaking on the call, we will also have Libertys CFO, Chris Shean. During Q&A, well be available to answer questions related to Liberty Broadband as well. So starting with Liberty Media, during the quarter we completed the hedging period on our previously disclosed the Live Nation forward purchase. We will own when this hedge closes at the end of November, 34.4% of Live Nation. Were acquiring 15.9 million shares at an average price of 24.91 and were very happy with our increased involvement and investment. Live Nation announced stellar Q3 results last week revenue grew 10% and AOI, adjusted operating income was up 8% both in constant currency and these were driven by a 10% increase in attendance during the quarter. Sponsorship and advertising AOI grew an impressive 16% in constant currency and in ticketing Live Nation grew its primary and secondary GTV by 18%. Digital content is also performing at Live Nation with Yahoo live festival streaming and vice original programming having now delivered over 100 million streams to-date. We continue to focus on mobile with over 60% of Web traffic through mobile at Live Nation and were on track to deliver record performance for 2015. Looking back at Liberty Media itself, we continued buyback and we repurchased a total of $38 million of LMCK shares from 8/1 to 10/31 taking advantage impart of the increased spread between LMCA and LMCK. We also continue to focus on the overall discount between an LMC between it and its continuant components the NAV recent analysts estimates have had this discount somewhere in the mid to high-teens and we continue to look at alternatives to take advantage including stock repurchases as you saw in this quarter. So on to a few operational highlights at our subsidiary SIRIUSXM again posted very solid results and increased its guidance for net subscriber growth revenue and adjusted EBITDA. During the quarter subscriber count increased to nearly 29 million, revenue was up 11% to 1.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to a record $447 million. As of 10/20 our ownership in SiriusXM stood at about 60.7%. Looking at the Braves, our stadium and mixed used development is progressing well in September we closed on a stadium construction loan of $345 million to fund the remaining Braves portion of the stadium parking and plaza and we officially named the new mixed used development adjacent to SunTrust Park at Battery Atlanta. Additionally, we named John Coppolella as general manager during the quarter. Over at Liberty Broadband Charter continued to show excellent results with very good growth in customer relationships PSUs and revenue was up 7.2% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA 8.5% year-over-year and including the transaction cost we incurred during the quarter end transition cost related to our upcoming mergers and acquisitions we would have been up 9.7% year-over-year in adjusted EBITDA. We remain very excited about the Charter, Time Warner Cable and the Bright House combination and the ability to successfully apply the Charter strategy across the larger footprint. We look forward to seeing many of you on November 12th in New York for our Annual Investor Meeting. Well have lots of fun things to talk about and with that I'll turn it back over to Chris to talk about our financial results. Chris Shean Thanks Greg. Just a reminder that while Sirius Consolidated and Liberty Media's financial statements we suggest we think it would be better to go directly to their Web site in publicly filed documents for your analysis on that asset. At quarter-end Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $607 million and principal amount of debt of $6.9 billion which includes $5.5 billion of debt at SiriusXM and a margin loan at Liberty. Included in the 607 million in cash and liquid investments balance at September 30, 2015 is $153 million of cash held at SiriusXM. Liberty's cash and liquid investments excluding cash held at SiriusXM was $454 million. Now with that I'll turn the call back to Greg. Greg Maffei Thank you, Chris. And to the listening audience we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. And with that operator I would like to open the floor for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak. Jeff Wlodarczak I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on your high basis Siri shares, and then separately now that Sirius has had experience in pushing through a couple of price increases what your comfort level around Siri taking additional price increases and then I have got a follow-up thanks. Greg Maffei First I think we remain constant in our belief in SiriusXM and for many quarters now we've not sold any shares we did as you recall increased our stake dramatically from the 48-ish percent to well over 50 and SiriusXM has done a heavy lifting since and we did sell some shares just to get some of our base back but I think were very happy with our position and have no current intent to dispose of any more high basis or otherwise in SiriusXM. I'm not going to comment on future price increases other than to say both the churn and customer reaction on an ongoing basis and in light of prior increases indicates quite a lot of happiness with the products and quite a lot of price elasticity at least in my mind, but well see where we go with that. Jeff Wlodarczak Fair enough. And then on Charter Greg, how interesting is the idea of Charter offering sort of a Wi-Fi first MVNO wireless product to consumers outside of the home? Greg Maffei Ill let them make their announcement, but I think our Libertys belief is probably somewhat consistent with theirs 75% to 80% of all bits on mobile devices are already delivered through Wi-Fi. We have a unique plant in market to be able to offer customers incremental services that include Wi-Fi whether that is bundled in something which is a Wi-Fi first or whether it's a more broad MVNO or whether ultimately there is a richer offering on a quad-play the way there is in Europe, well see. I dont think that is know, and I think the market could evolve, but clearly the strength of our ability to have the network we have and offer Wi-Fi is very valuable to customers. Operator The next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Market. Barton Crockett To follow-up on your statement that you're interested in hanging out your Sirius shares. Now when you look at your kind of view of the value of that business, how much of it is really driven by the core subscription business if they have and how much of it is potentially driven by the long-term value that they might be able to unlock from spectrum as they move to kind of free up the Sirius spectrum? And you look at kind of the dynamics of the spectrum values in lost auction, does that really factor in kind of your long-term thinking of the value there? Greg Maffei Well, I think first and foremost, Sirius is a subscription company and it is value will come from that subscription. The company has done a excellent job of building on the initial lag first member with and aftermarket product now it became an OEM product and now adding this next leg which they have done very well over the last three years of the secondary market. We are -- there is not probably as much growth left given what has happened to STAR in the OEM market. But the potential to see the secondary market grow for as much as 10 to 15 years is very conceivable and very attractive. And with that comes other sources of value too in this company including the fact that were going to have many OEM installed non-subscribers number out who will never probably want to become subscribers, we dont pretend or believe that every car is a potential subscriber to a paid service just like not everyone is willing to subscribe to STARZ or HBO or Showtime. But we think there is quite a lot of room left to grow in both of those. But when you're done there is still a huge base of installed cars, that I think there is opportunity to do things with. And last and not least, we do have a lot of spectrum value and some of the actions were taking to unify our platform are going to create opportunities with that incremental spectrum. I dont view that as the driver of value, I view that as an incremental boost and obviously there is another feature as weve talked about which we havent accounted here which is the connected car, another subscription service. So I think that most of these are green shoots to a degree, I think they have got real potential, but we dont know the size of them and I put the spectrum in that category as well. Barton Crockett Okay, thats helpful. And then if I can switch gears here a little bit, to what extent do you think Liberty Media could be potentially valuable as a consolidation vehicle, or acquisition vehicle for emerging music services there is a lot of innovation in that area. You have stakes in companies that are in that area, but have earnings meet cyclical earnings. Liberty Medias some of the parts really doesnt have to focus on earnings. So to what extent do you think you could get involved in taking stakes or making acquisitions or substance in that area? Greg Maffei Well that is a great question and you could see to some degree thats already happened. We have, and I believe we have disclosed the small stake venture capital stake in the company called Saavn which is an Indian streaming company. Weve looked at virtually there isnt a streaming company that we have not spoken with either Sirius or Liberty or both and in some cases have imagined that given the high profitability of Sirius and as you rightly put we have got more the NAV orientation of Liberty that perhaps some of it ought to fit the equities ought to sit inside Liberty for a period while they bake because in a lot of cases the models as you have rightly pointed out where these emerging services are not robust yet and not known and dont fit very well. So thats not a crazy idea and youve already seen a bit of that with our Saavn investment and we as I said we look for punch. Barton Crockett Okay I mean since you threw it out there, I mean do you have a sense of the desirability of businesses like Spotify with your evaluation or candor with its valuation whether you can look at those types of models maybe not the specific equities and see a case where value and you're willing to spend and they are willing to price it could meet are you in the ballpark, could you think there is separation there? Greg Maffei I think the biggest issue have for us has been the uncertainty around some of the models because of the nature of the variable content costing very high as a percent of revenue, potential only for increases in those contents with some rulings or some approaches from content owners whether they be the broadcast the play services or the publishers so all of those have given us uncertainty about what the real cost or what the real potential to earn your cost of content in this businesses are particular when you throw on the cost of servicing streaming et cetera. So most of our hesitation has not been where does this belong Liberty or Sirius but what is the nature of the business model and what is the sustainability. Operator Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. James Ratcliffe If my math is right the -- once you've completed the Live transaction there is going to be pretty minimal cash balance sitting at LMCA. And can you talk about other potential sources of liquidity, should you desire it there I mean I have seem you could extend the margin loans on Sirius for example but are there other options there? Thanks. Greg Maffei I first would note that we believe there is quite a lot of borrowing capacity. We have the long-term $1 billion exchangeable there. We have which sort of mature another eight years or some point then and we have a margin loan against our Sirius stake on which we had diminished several hundred million dollars drawn and it's safe to say we have several many times that in capacity undrawn and so I don't worry about that. We've also shown an ability to raise incremental capital against some of our existing stakes or in our existing company. So yes it is always feast or famine in the sense that for the first eight years I was at Liberty all we ever thought about and heard was what are you going to do with all that cash in your balance sheet now were at the other end of the spectrum and we've been blessed with somewhat of a decent track record and people have approached us to bet various ways to finance and we've always found ways to raise capital for the right opportunity. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisor Group. Tom Eagan  I have a broader question on cable for either Greg or John, there has been some talk about cable operators providing video service outside of their footprint I guess as a video service on the Internet versus one that is based on facilities. I guess my question is what do you think about that, pros and cons to the operators? Greg Maffei I think in general over builders have had a very tough time in marketplaces. To my knowledge it's hard to point to a very successful over builder who made return their cost of capital. So we have a great opportunity to invest on our won footprint upgrade speeds do more with go all digital in the footprint do a lot with our footprint that is we hope to close soon, the combined Charter Time Warner Bright House footprint and I think that frankly is a lot of more attractive in opportunity and potentially adding on services like wireless than trying to decide we are going to overbuild into other markets. Operator Your next question comes from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant I have two so Greg I am getting a lot of questions on the spread of LMCA at the Sirius and which stock should I buy and I'm sort of trying to understand is there any urgency at Liberty to close those at spread obviously you talked about. You have liquidity to do that if you seem to want to do so. Can you just talk about how important it is to close a spread or is this going to be national and we sort of deal with it when tax consolidation probably happens. And second given you've been one of the largest investors in cable in the U.S. and you have had Alties come along recently and talk about synergies that are even higher than the synergies on the Time Warner Cable Charter deal for a much smaller asset. Can you just talk about is that something there that they see or you have sort of studies and think there is a real opportunity for U.S. cable operators that we are all missing? Greg Maffei On closing the spread, look I consider it a personal insult for all investors putting us at a discount because it suggests that they think were going to overpay for Siri or do something else that is irrational. I hope we demonstrate a track record of not doing that but well have to see. Historically we've taken advantage of those discounts to NAV to purchase stock or do other things to take advantage of the discount and subsequently get fully valued NAV and outperform the underlying equities well see if that proves to be the case again but I would put my money on it. On the LT synergies I view their entry to the marketplace is largely good. If they do something thats highly beneficial and highly attractive and highly effective in running cable plans at much lower costs than existing operators in the U.S. market are able to, I hope we'll go to school on it and learn will either make our business far more profitable or maybe they'll buy us all out because they can make them all they can run them much better either seems to bode very well for our equities. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne First question any update on Vivendi litigations timing wise, I think were coming in on maybe the beginning of a trial here in December. If just any update you guys have on timing and process would be great? Greg Maffei Ill let Rich Baer, our General Counsel comment on that. Rich Baer Yes, the matter has been set for oral arguments before the court of appeal, so it's not a trial it's just an impelled argument. The second circa will consider those arguments in March of next year. And then they typically rule within six to eight months after that. Ben Swinburne And do we know what interest youll be earning on the cash or thats still on the settlement or the fines I guess should be the best way to put it or that is still also being debated? Greg Maffei Well there are two parts to that, the first part is what interest we earn from the time the fraud occurred to the ruling of the judge and that is being in dispute. To what we earn from the time the ruling came down till today is not in dispute and that is a low treasury rate. If the dispute is whether we earn that treasury rate from roughly 2002 till 2014 or whether we earn a 9% simple interest rate under New York contract law which is our aim. Ben Swinburne And then just lastly Greg switching back to the music business, a bit of a random one, but since you are a big investor to Live Nation and you have booked it a lot of music businesses. What do you make of Pandora buying Ticketfly do you see that as something that might impact Live Nation in any way or do you have realized they are much slower taking business today, but do you think the combination there is interesting as it relates to the competitive set for Live Nation or it is something that Live Nation might be able to do in that direction to enhance their business? Greg Maffei I think Ticketfly is mostly directed at smaller venues which is not where the bread and butter of Live Nation is, our success and our strength is really in large global ticketing cards global tours and so I dont want to be dismissive of a competitor but they are not really front and center as much of a problem or as much we dont -- they are not as tough as some out there. I think it is interesting to imagine though that events and programming are useful for promoting a service because I think it suggests there are possibilities in the portfolio we have between Live Nation and SiriusXM to work together. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar Greg just a couple of questions from you, first is on the cable side of it if you just look at the footprint for Charter there the initial plan was maybe two years ago versus where it is now, is there any scope for optimization? And not specifically with respect to Charter, but when you look across the ecosystem with Alties in the mix and so on in terms of assets allotments are not going forward? And the second is given the kind of pressure the media guys are seeing, I mean is that an opportunity for you guys at some point to start looking at some media assets just given everything else that you own in your portfolio? Thanks. Greg Maffei So on the first asset swaps are really one of the most attractive ways to optimize a cable portfolio I think as you rightly point out, one of my predecessors Leo Henry had the Summer of Love back in the mid to late 90s when there was a massive series of swaps which were mapped hugely beneficial to the industry and obviously the transactions that we contemplated but were unable to complete with Comcast because they were unable to complete their Time Warner purchase with a series of swaps which we thought was very optimal for both of us. All thats probably off to table for a while but it's certainly not to say that it doesnt ultimately in some cases make sense to move towards that. And on the question of media assets, we certainly notice that certain of the media companies have been seen their valuations come down quite a bit and were always looking thats the nature of who we are, but I dont think were ready to announce anything this afternoon. I think it is the question operator, thank you. Operator And our last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan I was curious as a suitable building and FCTA does really a lot more anxiety about how compatible LTE and license and Wi-Fi are, could you just provide us some thoughts on that and then thoughts on the valuation of the spectrum auction next year, I mean several of the indications are kind of all over the place in terms of what some of the telecoms executives are saying? Greg Maffei Matt to make sure I understand your first point, so Ill get the second point first, I certainly -- we watch the spectrum auctions. We have some interest even Siri we have some interest given what Charter may want to do, but were certainly not experts, so Ill pass on what is going to happen in those spectrum auctions the speculation. But make sure I understand the first part of the question. Matthew Harrigan Yes, I mean there are some technology issues with LTE advance and Wi-Fi, I mean LTE is very grabby and on license spectrum and there is some concern that it could affect the QoS on Wi-Fi, Verizon is going ahead pretty aggressively with some things and it feels like overall people are getting a lot more pulled up in Wi-Fi both in terms of the churn reduction and even some more direct monetization possibilities and there seems to be more and more concern about this interference between the technologies I mean Wi-Fi kind of is very passive and LTE it will just kind of take a slot. Greg Maffei Well generally the guys who have licensed investments have more incentive and have been probably more aggressive at standard spikes because they've invested more to get there. So I think thats a natural. That happens and those spikes happen all the time. I'm sure they will get sort out at some point and the SEC will be likely be arbitrators of parts of it so well see. Greg Maffei Thank you to all of you out there. And as I said hope to see many of you next week in New York. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak. Jeff Wlodarczak I just wanted to get your latest thoughts on your high basis Siri shares, and then separately now that Sirius has had experience in pushing through a couple of price increases what your comfort level around Siri taking additional price increases and then I have got a follow-up thanks. Greg Maffei First I think we remain constant in our belief in SiriusXM and for many quarters now we've not sold any shares we did as you recall increased our stake dramatically from the 48-ish percent to well over 50 and SiriusXM has done a heavy lifting since and we did sell some shares just to get some of our base back but I think were very happy with our position and have no current intent to dispose of any more high basis or otherwise in SiriusXM. I'm not going to comment on future price increases other than to say both the churn and customer reaction on an ongoing basis and in light of prior increases indicates quite a lot of happiness with the products and quite a lot of price elasticity at least in my mind, but well see where we go with that. Jeff Wlodarczak Fair enough. And then on Charter Greg, how interesting is the idea of Charter offering sort of a Wi-Fi first MVNO wireless product to consumers outside of the home?

This call also may include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding Liberty Broadband. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements, including the ability to complete the Charter transaction and Liberty Broadband's related investments. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Broadband expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions, or circumstances on which any such statement is based. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. Gregory Maffei Thank you, Courtney, and good morning to all of you out there on the phone. Today speaking on the call, besides myself, we'll have Liberty's CFO, Chris Shean. During the Q&A, we'll also be happy to answer any questions you may have related to Liberty Broadband. First, focusing on Liberty Media. A mere 13 years in the making, we are very pleased to announce the settlement of our Vivendi litigation with a payment of $775 million. After payments to some other parties, including some lawyers and some government payable taxes, we'll net after-tax proceeds of approximately $420 million [indiscernible]. The S-4 related to the recapitalization into three tracking stocks was declared effective by the SEC on February 19. We have a stockholder meeting scheduled to vote on these on April 11. So let me focus on the operational highlights for a moment, beginning with SiriusXM, which again posted very good results. Subscriber count increased to 29.6 million. 2015 revenue totaled $4.6 billion, up 9%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to a record $1.66 billion. Notably, during the quarter, we signed a long-term agreement with Howard Stern, which includes his extensive audio and video library. And as of the end of January, Liberty's ownership stake stood at 62.1%. Turning now to Live Nation. Live Nation had a record year as well. Revenue, adjusted operating income, and free cash flow were all up 11% in constant currency during 2015. Live Nation promoted 25,000 concerts last year to 63 million fans. At Ticketmaster, GTV was up 12% in constant currency and Ticketmaster processed a record 530 million tickets globally. Live Nation continued its international expansion in 2016. Live Nation Canada acquired investment portfolio from Union Events earlier this month, and we acquired a controlling interest in South Africa's leading concert promoter earlier this week. And lastly, looking at the Braves, SunTrust Park construction continues. We've reached the 50% completion stage. The project is 95% designed and approximately 75% leased or committed. In December, we closed on the mix-used financing, totaling $207 million. And looking at the operating performance and prospects for the team, we've dramatically strengthened the farm system and are generally ranked number one by most pundits. Turning for a moment over to Liberty Broadband. Charter's results continued to be impressive. Strong growth in customer relationships PSUs, 2015 revenue was up 7.1%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 6.8%, and excluding transaction transition cost related to our pending Time Warner and Bright House transactions, would have been up 8.5%. Free cash flow grew to $550 million in 2015, up from $170 million in 2014. And again, excluding M&A-related costs, free cash flow would have been over $1 billion, up $700 million from 2014. 2015 marks the first full year in over a decade, in which Charter grew total video subscribers. We remain very excited about the prospects for Charter, Timer Warner Cable, and Bright House coming together. The ability for Charter to apply, if successful, all digital strategy, simplified pricing and other aspects of its business model across this larger footprint is going to have compelling results in our judgment. Notably, the regulatory process is progressing. Lastly, we look forward to seeing you all at the upcoming conference season in March. And with that, I'll turn it over to Chris, to talk about our financial results in more detail. Christopher Shean Thanks, Greg. As we've pointed out in previous quarters, since we control and consolidate SiriusXM, the numbers are included in our filings, but we suggest that you refer to their separately produced financial statements and information for the purest view of their results. At quarter end, Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $216 million and principal amount of debt of $6.9 billion, which includes $5.5 billion of debt at SiriusXM and a margin loan at Liberty. Included in the $216 million in cash and liquid investments balance at December 31, 2015, is $112 million held at SiriusXM. Liberty's cash and liquid investments, excluding cash held at SIRI, was $104 million. Uses of cash at Liberty in the fourth quarter included closing out the forward contract to purchase Live Nation shares for $236 million, share repurchases, and capital expenditures for the Braves Stadium development. This balance does not include cash from the Vivendi settlement. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for Q&A. Gregory Maffei Thanks, Chris. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. And I'd now like to open it for questions. Operator, please? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Amy Young of Macquarie. Amy Young Two questions. First, Greg, can you talk about, obviously, there is a lot of dislocation in the market right now. What are some of the opportunities that you see, particularly now that you have so much cash from the Vivendi proceeds? And then, secondly, do you actually need a tax capital opinion before your shareholder vote? Gregory Maffei First, I think on market opportunities, one of our experiences is that it generally takes longer for sellers or potential sellers to come to grips with new market conditions than the buyers think they ought. But we do certainly see places, where things are attractive or more attractive than they were, and that's probably part of the reason the settlement with Vivendi appeared certainly more compelling than waiting given the opportunities we cash. Some of those opportunities certainly relate in our own portfolio where there are dislocations, as you noted, between our stocks and some of the underlying components. That will hopefully become more clear upon the completion of our three tracking stock transaction in April. And so we watch all those with interest. I'm not exactly prepared to announce which one today, but we'll move forward. And I don't think we are in the need of any other opinions of counsel. We are set to go with a vote on our tracking stock structure on April 11, I believe, yes, and move forward. Christopher Shean We should complete the restructuring within a few days thereafter. Gregory Maffei Thank you, Chris Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Pan with JPMorgan. Eric Pan So we saw the financials on the Braves and S-4 and seeing how it doesn't generate a lot of cash flow, how should investors go about valuing the franchise? How did you go about it when you bought the assets, and are there any other public comps out there that we can look at? Gregory Maffei These are like almost mystical questions, valuing baseball teams. So I'll work backwards. We certainly look at some comps on where things are traded when we bought the team, and remembering that we paid something like just under $450 million, looks like a pretty attractive transaction on its surface, but when you dig a little deeper, remember we had something like $300 million of tax savings on how we execute the transaction; it looks a lot more attractive. I think the best way to look at this is comps. And unfortunately, they really aren't comps that publicly trade. There have been comps in the private market transactions, where portions all obtained have been sold. And those multiples have generally been a multiple of revenue and those have moved somewhere between, say, 3x and 4x, up to maybe more like 4x to 5x. And that would only be, what I understand from observers, we certainly aren't proposing a value in the market, that's what the market is going to get to do itself. But I'm afraid that looking for cash flow from baseball teams is hard. Most people think this is one of the better run teams, one of the more financially tightly run teams. And there are quite a lot of other assets that baseball teams' owns like proportionate shares of MLBAM, Advance Media. So there are a lot of ways to think about it, but we'll see how it trades. Eric Pan And then on closing the spread, I think most investors are looking for this catalyst that could ultimately complete close to the discounts to NAV. If the recap doesn't quite do the job or only gets you there half way, because there is still no light at the end of the tunnel in terms of consolidation, is there anything else you can do? Gregory Maffei We may have one or two more ideas, but we'll see how this one goes. And I don't think -- we have to have something to talk about in the next few earnings calls, so I'd not want to tip all today. Operator Your next question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. James Ratcliffe Two housekeeping ones. First of all, unless, assume you don't do anything with the cash from Vivendi before the trackers are created, which tracker does it get assigned to? And secondly, you said you closed the $207 million financing for the Braves, is that actually in the debt balances at yearend or is that yet to be drawn? Gregory Maffei So on the first part, that cash will be attributed to the Liberty Media tracker. And by that I mean not the Liberty Braves tracker and not the Liberty SiriusXM tracker. That loss has always been sitting in there. And we have the facility available, but not drawn as of yearend on the Braves facility. James Ratcliffe And do you expect to be able to need essentially all that by the time the stadium opens? Gregory Maffei Yes, that's correct. Operator Your next question is from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Market. Barton Crockett I wanted to ask a little bit about Liberty Broadband. It's one of the cleaner kind of some of the parts that you guys have, and it trades at a notable discount. What do you think of as kind of the options that would be most reasonable to look at for closing that? And in particular, after the Time Warner Cable and Charter deal closes, assuming it closes, which we don't think it will, is there any reasons for Broadband to continue to exist or is there any real friction or a reason for us not to think that eventually that would recombine with Charter at some point? Gregory Maffei Well, I think your last point suggests that's obviously one way to shrink the discounts to some kind of recombination with or a combination rather with Charter. But there are other things that you could imagine where we could take advantage of discount through share repurchase or doing things along those lines. So I don't think we're committed to any one of them. Why does Liberty Broadband exist? I think Liberty Broadband has certain rights, including preemptive rights, including governance rights that are attractive. And while we think we can be a positive force in Charter and utilize those voting rights, and preemptive rights, and governance rights, we're going to continue to exist and use them. That doesn't say it will be forever. That's been our history, at some point, we generally seek liquidity. But at the moment I think we have a healthy role to play. Barton Crockett And then kind of on a related note here, kind of spanning this call and the next one, once the transaction closes with Time Warner Cable and Charter, ventures will be presumably buying a bunch of Broadband stock at a price that's above where Broadband is currently trading. So you'll generate an instant kind of capital loss on that, at least for book purposes. Does that create any opportunities to potentially exit that tax efficiently maybe by spinning the Broadband shares or for dividending them out to venture's shareholders after this transaction is completed? Gregory Maffei Well, I would say a couple of things. First, I wouldn't say we're being presumptuous partner, but you're assuming that that will be the case that the LBRD will be trading below that price. If you look, Charter is already trading above the $176.95 reference price at which we are buying stock. It's only that LBRD is trading at some discount to be underlying NAV. So I don't think on any realistic value basis, since our belief is we would not get out of the discount, that it will be unattractive. And I have actually confidence that Charter is going to rise more, partly based on it's operating results and partly as it becomes more clear, the transaction will close. In fact, I perversely kind of wish it would trade below $176.95, because I think issuing the $4.3 billion of stock and anything like that price is not attractive. And I would prefer that we issue more cash to the Time Warner shareholders and keep the leverage up. But the market is already finding that deal attractive and moving in through the $176.95 price. We would take a little longer perspective and have the belief that the Charter investment is very attractive both for LBRD and for LVNTA. And that I would only hope it's below the $176.95 on the day we close, I'd love it to be $176.94, not issue the stock. And then have the thing trade up dramatically over the next year or two, because that's my belief as to what will happen. Operator Your next question is from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan This might be even more mystical than in the Braves valuation question. But with all the angst over ESPN and even the blowback into the stock prices across the media sector, including your own, and then things happening like the NHL transaction and hopefully a nice product that they've rolled out there on the direct-to-consumer side, what do you think about the long-term delivery of the sports program, including more direct-to-consumer and the leverage for the value of the Braves over time, because you seem pretty confident there's worth more than floors valuation that's a lot of people carry. Gregory Maffei I think ESPN is in an unusual situation, where it's gone from about being as perfect as you could be in terms of full carriage, relatively high prices, great ad rates, good viewing, et cetera, to a world where you may have skinner bundles and then not being included. We at the Braves are in a little different position. Baseball has a ton of sports programming, given the fact there were 162 games, that's very attractive, that tonnage is worth a lot. Bob Bowman at MLBAM can make the case far more articulately than I can. But in addition, because of the Braves, the nature of where we stood, we don't own our RSN, we don't have -- we had relatively unattractive contracts that we inheritably brought the team that were very long life. They've been made more attractive, but are still probably not, what I would consider, a market rate. So we probably have more upside than most franchises and do not own our own RSN or even a portion of it. So we're not, unlike ESPN, which went from the heights, we are sitting probably not with the heights of relationships in terms of what we could earn for the value of the team. So that's why I think there's probably net-net upside to us, even if sports programming in the whole had some challenges. Operator Our last question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet I think a lot of the sports rights revenues that you get are sort of locked up for a decent amount of time through the league. But do you think that ultimately when you come up for, when the NLB comes up for renewal, that these pay TV challenges will ultimately moderate the value of TV rights for sports in terms of the growth? Gregory Maffei Jason, I would differentiate two things. There are the national games and we get a portion of that revenue and that has had been raised very attractively, and in fact, Terry McGuirk who runs the team, CEO of the team is on the media rights committee and he's probably been very effective and helpful, given his history in the media business and making sure those rights are valuable to MLB. There is another portion which is local rights that we have tied up till 2027, very long, the longest wide deal in baseball, but as I said, we inherited when we purchased the team from Time Warner. And that is the portion where I think we are way below market. Obviously market gets tested relatively frequently. I think the four year deals on the national thing whereas it is untested since we took the thing over in 2007, a 20-year deal on the local. So the opportunity I think was good for national, but particularly good for us in local, given we have this long life contract, which is less attractive than many of our peers. So I think there is room for one more question, operator? Operator Yes sir. Your next question is from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Tom Eagan Question on LMCA, as we approach the upcoming tracking stock split and the creation of Liberty Sirius, I was hoping you could compare and contrast the Liberty Sirius tracker with the old LMDIA Liberty tracker with DirecTV in terms of structure, voting rights and strategy. Gregory Maffei So Tom, I would say that they are largely similar. A couple of differences, the voting rights, all those things are largely similar to my recollection. That was a while ago, but as the best I can recap. But that would know, which is in the old LMDIA, we had three RSNs as well as a 57% economic and 48% voting position in DirecTV. Here we really only have our 62% plus position in Sirius, and it's about as clean as you can possibly be. So I think that's the one contrast between the two positions. Tom Eagan And in terms of the strategy? Gregory Maffei I think we've expressed in the past with our actions and our words that we would love to be owner of 100% of SiriusXM. I think we've also expressed in the past with our actions and our words, there is a limit of what we're going to pay for that, and our position has gone from being 40.1% or 40.4% when we struck the transaction back in February and March of '09 to being 62%-plus today. And time is on our side in terms of -- eventually, I believe, we're likely to be the 100% owner at some reasonable price. End of Q&A Gregory Maffei With that, operator, I think we're done. Again, thank you to all and our listening audience. And thank you for continued interest in Liberty, and we hope to see you soon.

There are the national games and we get a portion of that revenue and that has had been raised very attractively, and in fact, Terry McGuirk who runs the team, CEO of the team is on the media rights committee and he's probably been very effective and helpful, given his history in the media business and making sure those rights are valuable to MLB. There is another portion which is local rights that we have tied up till 2027, very long, the longest wide deal in baseball, but as I said, we inherited when we purchased the team from Time Warner. And that is the portion where I think we are way below market. Obviously market gets tested relatively frequently. I think the four year deals on the national thing whereas it is untested since we took the thing over in 2007, a 20-year deal on the local. So the opportunity I think was good for national, but particularly good for us in local, given we have this long life contract, which is less attractive than many of our peers. So I think there is room for one more question, operator? Operator Yes sir. Your next question is from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Tom Eagan Question on LMCA, as we approach the upcoming tracking stock split and the creation of Liberty Sirius, I was hoping you could compare and contrast the Liberty Sirius tracker with the old LMDIA Liberty tracker with DirecTV in terms of structure, voting rights and strategy. Gregory Maffei So Tom, I would say that they are largely similar. A couple of differences, the voting rights, all those things are largely similar to my recollection. That was a while ago, but as the best I can recap. But that would know, which is in the old LMDIA, we had three RSNs as well as a 57% economic and 48% voting position in DirecTV. Here we really only have our 62% plus position in Sirius, and it's about as clean as you can possibly be. So I think that's the one contrast between the two positions. Tom Eagan And in terms of the strategy? Gregory Maffei I think we've expressed in the past with our actions and our words that we would love to be owner of 100% of SiriusXM. I think we've also expressed in the past with our actions and our words, there is a limit of what we're going to pay for that, and our position has gone from being 40.1% or 40.4% when we struck the transaction back in February and March of '09 to being 62%-plus today. And time is on our side in terms of -- eventually, I believe, we're likely to be the 100% owner at some reasonable price. End of Q&A Gregory Maffei With that, operator, I think we're done. Again, thank you to all and our listening audience. And thank you for continued interest in Liberty, and we hope to see you soon.

Now, Id like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. Greg Maffei Thank you, Courtney. Good morning to all of you out there. Today speaking on the call, besides myself, we'll have Liberty's CFO, Chris Shean. During Q&A, we'll also be available to answer questions related to Liberty Broadband. So, first, onto Liberty Media. We were pleased to complete the recapitalization into three tracking stocks of Liberty Media on April 15. Out of the blocks, not unexpectedly, trading has been somewhat volatile, but we are pleased to see that the discount has narrowed at LSXMA. Onto a few of the operational highlights. SiriusXM, once again posted very strong operating and financial results. Subscriber account increased to over 30 million to nearly 30.1 million. Q1 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA grew also 11% up to $441 million, and as of April 26, Libertys ownership stake stood at 63.8%.  Live Nation, another very solid quarter, strong revenue growth, up 10%. Adjusted operating income growth, up 7% in constant currency in the first quarter and lots of exciting indicators through April. Concert ticket sales pacing 10% ahead, a 13% increase in confirms stadium, arena and amphitheater shows. Contacted online advertising, up 14% and contracted sponsorship, up 10%. So were pleased with the operating performance and what's going on at Live. Also pleased with what's going on, other than on the field, at the Braves. We were glad that so many of you attended the investor meeting in Atlanta a couple of weeks back, hope you enjoyed the tour of the new ballpark. Dramatic game, not quite the ending we sought at -- in the ninth there or in the extra innings, but pleased you could come and see us. We are proceeding with the planned $200 million rights offering. We expect to distribute the rights on May 18th and launch the offering on May 19. They will be issued at a 20% discount to the volume weighted average trading price for the 18-day period, ending May 11. We will file an offering document prior to distributions date and plan to issue a press release later this week with additional information. That information will include what we are going to do with LMG, Liberty Media Group and its ownership in the inter-group interest.  So as we mentioned to some of you at Braves Investor Day, there will be a mechanism in place whereby LMG, Liberty Media Group will be compensated for the fact that it is not receiving rights to purchase incremental Batter shares by receiving a dividend in Batter shares, equal to the intrinsic value of the rights it did not receive. The equity percentage in Batter that Liberty Media Group owns will be diluted below 20% to a little over 15%, but the intrinsic or fair value of the inter-group interest is intended to remain the same, a lower equity percentage of a larger base once the rights have been exercised. Now, that's complicated and more detail on this mechanism will be available in our charter and will be explained in the press release that we intend to issue later this week.  So, onto some of the highlights on our investments at the Braves. The ballpark and mixed-use development projects continue at pace, on time and on budget. Weve spent $37 million of capital on the ballpark and mixed-use during the first quarter. We drew down $70 million incremental on the inter-group note, the proceeds of which went to fund that capital spend and repay other borrowing facilities and add to cash.  As of the end of March, the Braves had spent approximately $206 million on the ballpark and mixed-use development, $76 million towards the ballpark and $130 million on the mixed-use development, including $7 million of cost towards future development phases. So, let me finish up by commenting on Liberty Broadband. Over at Liberty Broadband, Charters results continue to impress. Strong growth in TSUs, customer relationships, first quarter revenue up 7.1%, first-quarter adjusted EBITDA of 10.4%, I don't think there is a large cable company thats growing nearly as quickly. We continued on all the positive 2015 trends, we grew video subscribers and of course we remain very excited about the combination of Charter, Time Warner Cable and Bright House. Obviously we see light at the end of the tunnel. We received SEC approval last week. With the Charter shares up significantly over the purchase price at which Liberty Broadband will pay to buy incremental shares in Charter which is $176.95, Liberty Broadband on an NAV basis is up little over $1 billion on its investment and we're pleased to see that Liberty Broadband stock has also performed well. So there is a significant discount still to the NAV. With that, let me turn it over to Chris to talk about our financial results in more detail. Chris Shean Thanks, Greg. At quarter end, Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $663 million. Included in the $663 million in cash and liquid balance at quarter is $102 million held directly at SiriusXM. Libertys consolidated cash and liquid investments excluding cash at SiriusXM was $561 million. You'll notice from the press release and filings that we included attributed financials as of March 31. However, these attributed financial statements only reflect cash at each entity and do not include any allocation of corporate cash pro forma for this tracking stock creation. Using the March 31 numbers as though the trackers were distributed on that day, this would imply cash and liquid investments at each tracking stock group as follows.  Liberty SiriusXM $152 million which includes $102 million of cash thats directly held by SIRI and $50 million in corporate allocations; Liberty Brands $94 million which includes $44 million held directly by the Braves and $50 million in corporate allocation; and then Liberty Media $417 million, which deducts from the March 31 balance of $517 million, the combined $100 million of corporate cash attributed to the other two trackers. Liberty had cash at consolidated principal amount of debt of $7.1 million which includes $5.8 billion of debt held at SiriusXM. The breakdown of attributed debt by tracking stock group is provided in the press release as of March 31. Now I'll turn it back over to Greg.  Greg Maffei Thank you, Chris. So to the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. Now I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator, please. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research. James Ratcliffe Two, if I could. One on Liberty Media Corporation and one on Liberty SiriusXM. First of all Liberty Media Corporation, right now as I understand it, the Braves are the only five-year trade or business in there? And I guess if you get to 80% on Sirius, would it qualify? And if so, would the clock just start running for five years, or would it automatically be a five-year ATB? And I guess secondly, any thoughts on the prospect of Sirius paying a dividend and Liberty's view on that? Thanks. Greg Maffei So on the question of could Sirius be an ATB, it largely will come down to how we eventually combine with it - it is combined. In the fullness of time it could become an ATB in any case, but to make it an ATB quicker, it would need to be done with stock and entirely with stock. There may be some ways around that on the dividend. They pay a dividend first or something like that, but it is basically think about it as a stock combination. Albert, did I get that right? Albert Rosenthaler Yes. Greg Maffei Albert has trained me at least to the degree I am trainable reasonably well. And then on the second question about Sirius as a dividend I think the SiriusXM board including the Liberty representatives spent an awful lot of time thinking about capital allocation and looking both at the question of Libertys ownership level, but more importantly what  if share repurchase attractive, what are the alternatives around either a one-time dividend in cash or continuing dividend cash and all those have been considered and remain considered as far as I can tell at the SiriusXM board. James Ratcliffe Okay, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Kraft Hi, good morning. Greg, now that the trackers have been issued and there is still some pretty wide discounts to NAV on them, can you just talk about some of the tools you have at your disposal to decrease those discounts? And if so, how would you think about using those, I guess, to try to drive those discounts lower at this point? Thanks. Greg Maffei Fair question, Bryan. I think in general Liberty's stocks have always traded at a discount somewhere between 2% and 35% if memory holds me since I have been at Liberty. And in general weve tried to take advantage of that through share repurchase. There have been other methods, but thats the primary one. And we really don't care about them until the day we want to go get realization and obviously some period before we are going to issue stock we would care a lot more about fair value and achieving it other than that realizations. So the one that was most pressing or one you think about Liberty SXM and in that case I think some of the things you could see is share repurchase at SXM - LSXM, you could see probably the fact that Sirius is buying its stock so much more aggressively than we are buying back LSXM is part of what's contributing to discount. So you could think about how that ratio works. You could think about some kind of a transaction for example where we issued an exchangeable into our SXM stock and bought back LSXM stock, so selling SIRI effectively forward at some number and buying our own stock back. So there are other corporate finance techniques which I'm sure much aggressive investment bankers will be bringing us tons of ideas after this call. Bryan Kraft That's really helpful. Thanks. Greg. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. David Joyce Thank you. It's David Joyce for Vijay. Regarding your investment in Live Nation, what would your appetite be to help fund any potential future consolidation in their industry given that you're essentially at you full equity ownership there? Thank you.  Greg Maffei David, we have spent and our corporate finance and corporate development team has spent a lot of time working in conjunction with the teams at John Hopmans and the teams obviously Michael Rapino, but also the teams below him at Live thinking about not only potential acquisitions, but how they would get financed. And certainly if the acquisition were enough scale and were attractive enough for Live, we would be very interested and frankly weve had discussions where we might provide incremental capital to Live. But I think it would really be depending upon Lives needs and not our pushing and what we would do with that 35% cap. David Joyce All right, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.  Jeff Wlodarczak Good morning, Greg. I realize your intention is to stick around for a while in Charter. However, all else being equal, isn't the most logical conclusion there in RMT between Liberty Broadband and Charter? And then I wanted to get your take overall on the concessions that Charter agreed to get the deal by regulators. And then realizing this deal hasn't officially closed yet, is there anything from your perspective, I guess from a regulatory perspective that would stop Charter from purchasing additional US cable assets? Thanks. Greg Maffei Okay. Jeff, thats really hard. Lets see, Ill start with the RMT. I think thats certainly one path that we might pursue on that. We are  SiriusXM  excuse me, Charter is going to be a serious cash flow generator in the near-term, what they do, how they move forward on their own share repurchase or whether they buy incremental cable assets, we will see. I think thats some  I am attacking your last question first in a way, but that would somewhat set up the regulatory environment and that will somewhat drive our timing about RMT or anything like that. So we will see. I think the concessions that we gave were meaningful. Certainly, no one would like to be seven years on either interconnect or no usage based pricing, realizing there is an effect of five year look if things change  circumstances change, but no one wants to run their business with that lack of flexibility. On the other hand, I dont think we had that built into our projections. So from a financial perspective, I dont believe its totally harmful, I also think its just reducing optionality, which is not something you would like to do. So I think the overbuilt is probably something most of which we would likely have achieved, but we will have to be careful to make sure we achieve the million of competitive, not necessarily cable over bill, competitive situations. So I think they are meaningful. As far as what could derail it from a regulatory perspective, I believe we  there is always a possibility, but I think the PUC in California is now the long pole in the tent and I think that thats  I dont want to dismiss their role, but I believe we can meet their concerns they have fairly, relatively easily.  Jeff Wlodarczak Thanks, Greg.  Greg Maffei Thank you.  Operator Your next question comes from the line Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.  Ben Swinburne Thank you. Greg, just sticking with the cable theme for a minute, do you have any reaction to the NPRM regarding what I guess is technically regarding backhaul and business services, but to me reads like a clear step towards rate regulation? At least in the business data world for cable, given how long you guys are. US cable assets. I know you've had time to digest that document. But I would love your thoughts if you have any. Greg Maffei Well, I think what youre referring to is what they were calling for a period of about two weeks special access rights, but now they have a new name for it and I have forgotten what it is off of top of my head. And I think its still open to how thats going to play out at NPRM. I also think its open to interpretation how much it becomes a problem for cable versus other existing telcos. And I think there is a lot between cup and lip on where thats going to end up. At least, one analysis I have looked at suggest its less of a problem for us than for telcos, but honestly I think there is a lot to be discerned before we can have a real view.  Ben Swinburne Got it. And then last quarter  I think it was last quarter, you talked about one of the motivations for settling Vivendi and incurring some tax payments was dislocation in the market. I think we interpreted that as being dislocation on the music industry, but maybe that was the wrong interpretation. But anyway, maybe you could just update us on your thinking around opportunities out there, since you seem to have seen some, but as far as I know haven't pulled the trigger on anything new since then. Greg Maffei Look, I just think the market got two things, market got a little cheaper in general or certain circumstances and situations. And secondly, since we had less cash, cash got a little more valuable to us. So both of those were suggested it was probably some reason why settling had more benefit than trying to fight, which could be several years in the making of the bill to be determined what we would get. I dont think we have  certainly dont have something we are going to announce this morning on what we intend to spend that money on, but we are looking at a host of opportunities actively, many of which I feel very good about.  Ben Swinburne Great. And just one last one, it's on mechanics. If Sirius were to buy Liberty Sirius tracking stock because it's a cheaper way to buy their own equity, and then you collapse the structure down the road, would any taxable gain they would incur, would they be able to shield that with the NOLs they have? I just wonder if there is any tax reasons why they wouldn't look at this as an opportunity to take advantage of some dislocation in the market. Greg Maffei Without giving you all the insight based on the SiriusXM Board, its certainly something thats come up and been discussed. I cant say that it will or will not happen, but its something that has been presented to us by others and has been noticed and discussed at the SiriusXM Board level. The decisions about it have not been driven by tax. I dont believe there will be any tax locations that would prohibit or prevent or deter someone from doing that.  Ben Swinburne Okay. Thanks very much.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Amy Young with Macquarie. Amy Young Thanks. Two questions. It seems like  to follow up on the Vivendi lawsuit, it seems like that lawsuit absorbed a lot of the tax assets that you have left. Can you talk about what you have that's remaining in the portfolio? And, Greg, as you talk about the host of opportunities in the landscape, I guess there is a lot of press announcements around your interest in Yahoo! Can you comment what appeals to you about this particular asset? And I guess the street perceives the Liberty family as tax experts, is there something that you could bring to the table? Thank you. Greg Maffei On the first part, youre correct that the Vivendi transaction was a taxable transaction and we used every available tax asset we had at the Liberty Media family to shield the gain. So the house is relatively  the cupboard is relatively bear, but we have found ways, thanks to Albert, of inventing or finding new ones and inventing  he is frowning at the word inventing, and covering new ones and maybe well find some more, but largely we are taxable from here forward. But there are some shields, for example, the interest paid on the convertible or exchangeable debentures, the  we had shields that just generate around the place, but they are not enormous.  I am not going to comment on Yahoo! specifically. I think in general, you can say that we believe we have some expertise at tax efficient transactions, including 355s and the like, and a potential interest in situations for us has been where we can come in and either provide some level of expertise. But frankly probably some level more credibility, both to investors and boards putting our money behind the transaction saying yeah we think this can get done. So again, while Im commenting on Yahoo in particular, situations of which that expertise credibility and willingness to put money behind a belief about the tax efficient transactions or the ones that are interesting to us. Operator The next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett On the topic of things to think about in terms of potential places to allocate some of your capital, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your interest at this point in things around the traditional radio space potentially. There is clearly a lot of capital opportunities with CBS radio potentially available, and some debt-driven considerations at some of the other big operators. To what extent do you see opportunities in that space or any logical interest in trying to do something in there, given your exposure via Live Nation and SIRI to radio generally? Greg Maffei Interesting question, Barton. I think in general we have looked at the potential that there might be some synergies between Sirius and traditional terrestrial radio. There are certain elements that traditional terrestrial radio which have been interesting, obviously we start with the fact that they pre-performance rights very attractive situation unlike these streaming companies and unlike Sirius XM. Start with the fact that they something like 93% coverage of the landscape pretty attractive, couple of potential fears. On other side, and obviously there might be synergies between the ways we can promote them and they could promote us. Couple of fears on the other side is most of the big ones, the biggest ones have got very difficult capital structures and even though we like working through those things that they proven to be very not simple. And you fear that 93% reach has only one way to go, which is potentially south. So we weight all those, we look at them with interest but we haven't certainly havent moved in anything yet in commercially. Barton Crockett And then just switching gears a little bit. There was a recent transaction involving in the baseball area, the Mariners. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts about the applicability of that transaction as something of a comparable that we should value potentially the Braves against? Greg Maffei Well, first I congratulate my friend John Stanton who is a long-time friend and a long-time Liberty associate. We had an advisory board, for a while John was on. John Malone was on McCaw Board when John Stanton was one of the senior officers so we watched this moves with great interest and he was on the board at 360 Networks when I was the CEO of it, so we watch John with great interest and I think were happy to see his  a smart guy like him endorsing the value of baseball whether that's the right valuation for the Braves or not, Ill leave it to others but it does suggest that there is some upside in the current trading price. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Tom Eagan A follow-up on Liberty SIRI. Assuming a Sirius purchase above $500 million a quarter and Liberty doesn't participate, we estimate that you will own about 98% of it by the fourth quarter of 2019. So I guess the question is, is that a timeframe that Liberty is willing to wait for? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Greg Maffei I don't think Tom its a black or white it's interesting now I assume that has a I dont know what you have for increase in stock price there but that looks probably  that sounds kind of aggressive to me but its good math for us. And its one that I think the SIRI board will certainly take up, its unlikely that theyre going to want to have us cross up that high in percentage, I think you need to, Im not speaking for them but its just a common thought that boards would be cautious about both liquidity, there would have to be some negotiations once we cross the 80% mark for tax consolidation, so there are issues around that. Whether we wait that long or not, I think somebody else will be the judge. Tom Eagan And then a follow-up on Charter and TWC in terms of the FCC concessions. On the cable over build, do you think that might set a precedent for concessions of any other deals? Thanks Greg Maffei I first want to, if you wouldn't mind clarify. I wouldn't describe it as cable over build, I think I went out of my way and I think it's been described as a competitive over build that can be different. So, I don't know whether the FCC will use that as a model for all future transactions. Ive only paid cursory interest in what the Cablevision sudden link restrictions are but I don't believe they have a over build condition in that one to my knowledge. And I can very well be wrong but I haven't seen that described, so I don't know whether it's the model or not. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich. Matthew Harrigan BrightHouse had a trial in Florida with T-Mobile on the head net here for mobile using their small [indiscernible] facilities and T-Mobile macro cells that got pretty gloriously pulled late last year. I was just curious what the Liberty in-house thinking was on the opportunities of mobile even beyond what people are happily doing right now, and since Spectrum valuations are all [indiscernible] relevant in Denver. Do you have you had any thoughts on the auction? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think first Liberty is informed by our Chairman experienced with Liberty Global and the quad nature of the market in Europe, and certainly John is a firm believer that eventually we will get to a quad market in United States. How that's done whether that's through partnership through NVNO, through Wi-Fi First through some larger kind of operation, well see, frankly Charter has been less vocal and focused on that given its desire to get to the process on the regulatory side. So I think we are mindful of what the marketplace is in Europe, we are mindful of how the marketplace is likely to develop in United States and we'll see where we go from here. Courtney Chun Thank you to everybody who joined us this morning, we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter if not sooner and thanks for your continued interest in Liberty Media.

There may be some ways around that on the dividend. They pay a dividend first or something like that, but it is basically think about it as a stock combination. Albert, did I get that right? Albert Rosenthaler Yes. Greg Maffei Albert has trained me at least to the degree I am trainable reasonably well. And then on the second question about Sirius as a dividend I think the SiriusXM board including the Liberty representatives spent an awful lot of time thinking about capital allocation and looking both at the question of Libertys ownership level, but more importantly what  if share repurchase attractive, what are the alternatives around either a one-time dividend in cash or continuing dividend cash and all those have been considered and remain considered as far as I can tell at the SiriusXM board. James Ratcliffe Okay, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Kraft Hi, good morning. Greg, now that the trackers have been issued and there is still some pretty wide discounts to NAV on them, can you just talk about some of the tools you have at your disposal to decrease those discounts? And if so, how would you think about using those, I guess, to try to drive those discounts lower at this point? Thanks. Greg Maffei Fair question, Bryan. I think in general Liberty's stocks have always traded at a discount somewhere between 2% and 35% if memory holds me since I have been at Liberty. And in general weve tried to take advantage of that through share repurchase. There have been other methods, but thats the primary one. And we really don't care about them until the day we want to go get realization and obviously some period before we are going to issue stock we would care a lot more about fair value and achieving it other than that realizations. So the one that was most pressing or one you think about Liberty SXM and in that case I think some of the things you could see is share repurchase at SXM - LSXM, you could see probably the fact that Sirius is buying its stock so much more aggressively than we are buying back LSXM is part of what's contributing to discount. So you could think about how that ratio works. You could think about some kind of a transaction for example where we issued an exchangeable into our SXM stock and bought back LSXM stock, so selling SIRI effectively forward at some number and buying our own stock back. So there are other corporate finance techniques which I'm sure much aggressive investment bankers will be bringing us tons of ideas after this call. Bryan Kraft That's really helpful. Thanks. Greg. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. David Joyce Thank you. It's David Joyce for Vijay. Regarding your investment in Live Nation, what would your appetite be to help fund any potential future consolidation in their industry given that you're essentially at you full equity ownership there? Thank you.  Greg Maffei David, we have spent and our corporate finance and corporate development team has spent a lot of time working in conjunction with the teams at John Hopmans and the teams obviously Michael Rapino, but also the teams below him at Live thinking about not only potential acquisitions, but how they would get financed. And certainly if the acquisition were enough scale and were attractive enough for Live, we would be very interested and frankly weve had discussions where we might provide incremental capital to Live. But I think it would really be depending upon Lives needs and not our pushing and what we would do with that 35% cap. David Joyce All right, thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research Group.  Jeff Wlodarczak Good morning, Greg. I realize your intention is to stick around for a while in Charter. However, all else being equal, isn't the most logical conclusion there in RMT between Liberty Broadband and Charter? And then I wanted to get your take overall on the concessions that Charter agreed to get the deal by regulators. And then realizing this deal hasn't officially closed yet, is there anything from your perspective, I guess from a regulatory perspective that would stop Charter from purchasing additional US cable assets? Thanks. Greg Maffei Okay. Jeff, thats really hard. Lets see, Ill start with the RMT. I think thats certainly one path that we might pursue on that. We are  SiriusXM  excuse me, Charter is going to be a serious cash flow generator in the near-term, what they do, how they move forward on their own share repurchase or whether they buy incremental cable assets, we will see. I think thats some  I am attacking your last question first in a way, but that would somewhat set up the regulatory environment and that will somewhat drive our timing about RMT or anything like that. So we will see. I think the concessions that we gave were meaningful. Certainly, no one would like to be seven years on either interconnect or no usage based pricing, realizing there is an effect of five year look if things change  circumstances change, but no one wants to run their business with that lack of flexibility. On the other hand, I dont think we had that built into our projections. So from a financial perspective, I dont believe its totally harmful, I also think its just reducing optionality, which is not something you would like to do. So I think the overbuilt is probably something most of which we would likely have achieved, but we will have to be careful to make sure we achieve the million of competitive, not necessarily cable over bill, competitive situations. So I think they are meaningful. As far as what could derail it from a regulatory perspective, I believe we  there is always a possibility, but I think the PUC in California is now the long pole in the tent and I think that thats  I dont want to dismiss their role, but I believe we can meet their concerns they have fairly, relatively easily.  Jeff Wlodarczak Thanks, Greg.  Greg Maffei Thank you.  Operator Your next question comes from the line Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.  Ben Swinburne Thank you. Greg, just sticking with the cable theme for a minute, do you have any reaction to the NPRM regarding what I guess is technically regarding backhaul and business services, but to me reads like a clear step towards rate regulation? At least in the business data world for cable, given how long you guys are. US cable assets. I know you've had time to digest that document. But I would love your thoughts if you have any. Greg Maffei Well, I think what youre referring to is what they were calling for a period of about two weeks special access rights, but now they have a new name for it and I have forgotten what it is off of top of my head. And I think its still open to how thats going to play out at NPRM. I also think its open to interpretation how much it becomes a problem for cable versus other existing telcos. And I think there is a lot between cup and lip on where thats going to end up. At least, one analysis I have looked at suggest its less of a problem for us than for telcos, but honestly I think there is a lot to be discerned before we can have a real view.  Ben Swinburne Got it. And then last quarter  I think it was last quarter, you talked about one of the motivations for settling Vivendi and incurring some tax payments was dislocation in the market. I think we interpreted that as being dislocation on the music industry, but maybe that was the wrong interpretation. But anyway, maybe you could just update us on your thinking around opportunities out there, since you seem to have seen some, but as far as I know haven't pulled the trigger on anything new since then. Greg Maffei Look, I just think the market got two things, market got a little cheaper in general or certain circumstances and situations. And secondly, since we had less cash, cash got a little more valuable to us. So both of those were suggested it was probably some reason why settling had more benefit than trying to fight, which could be several years in the making of the bill to be determined what we would get. I dont think we have  certainly dont have something we are going to announce this morning on what we intend to spend that money on, but we are looking at a host of opportunities actively, many of which I feel very good about.  Ben Swinburne Great. And just one last one, it's on mechanics. If Sirius were to buy Liberty Sirius tracking stock because it's a cheaper way to buy their own equity, and then you collapse the structure down the road, would any taxable gain they would incur, would they be able to shield that with the NOLs they have? I just wonder if there is any tax reasons why they wouldn't look at this as an opportunity to take advantage of some dislocation in the market. Greg Maffei Without giving you all the insight based on the SiriusXM Board, its certainly something thats come up and been discussed. I cant say that it will or will not happen, but its something that has been presented to us by others and has been noticed and discussed at the SiriusXM Board level. The decisions about it have not been driven by tax. I dont believe there will be any tax locations that would prohibit or prevent or deter someone from doing that.  Ben Swinburne Okay. Thanks very much.  Operator Your next question comes from the line of Amy Young with Macquarie. Amy Young Thanks. Two questions. It seems like  to follow up on the Vivendi lawsuit, it seems like that lawsuit absorbed a lot of the tax assets that you have left. Can you talk about what you have that's remaining in the portfolio? And, Greg, as you talk about the host of opportunities in the landscape, I guess there is a lot of press announcements around your interest in Yahoo! Can you comment what appeals to you about this particular asset? And I guess the street perceives the Liberty family as tax experts, is there something that you could bring to the table? Thank you. Greg Maffei On the first part, youre correct that the Vivendi transaction was a taxable transaction and we used every available tax asset we had at the Liberty Media family to shield the gain. So the house is relatively  the cupboard is relatively bear, but we have found ways, thanks to Albert, of inventing or finding new ones and inventing  he is frowning at the word inventing, and covering new ones and maybe well find some more, but largely we are taxable from here forward. But there are some shields, for example, the interest paid on the convertible or exchangeable debentures, the  we had shields that just generate around the place, but they are not enormous.  I am not going to comment on Yahoo! specifically. I think in general, you can say that we believe we have some expertise at tax efficient transactions, including 355s and the like, and a potential interest in situations for us has been where we can come in and either provide some level of expertise. But frankly probably some level more credibility, both to investors and boards putting our money behind the transaction saying yeah we think this can get done. So again, while Im commenting on Yahoo in particular, situations of which that expertise credibility and willingness to put money behind a belief about the tax efficient transactions or the ones that are interesting to us. Operator The next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett On the topic of things to think about in terms of potential places to allocate some of your capital, I wanted to ask you a little bit about your interest at this point in things around the traditional radio space potentially. There is clearly a lot of capital opportunities with CBS radio potentially available, and some debt-driven considerations at some of the other big operators. To what extent do you see opportunities in that space or any logical interest in trying to do something in there, given your exposure via Live Nation and SIRI to radio generally? Greg Maffei Interesting question, Barton. I think in general we have looked at the potential that there might be some synergies between Sirius and traditional terrestrial radio. There are certain elements that traditional terrestrial radio which have been interesting, obviously we start with the fact that they pre-performance rights very attractive situation unlike these streaming companies and unlike Sirius XM. Start with the fact that they something like 93% coverage of the landscape pretty attractive, couple of potential fears. On other side, and obviously there might be synergies between the ways we can promote them and they could promote us. Couple of fears on the other side is most of the big ones, the biggest ones have got very difficult capital structures and even though we like working through those things that they proven to be very not simple. And you fear that 93% reach has only one way to go, which is potentially south. So we weight all those, we look at them with interest but we haven't certainly havent moved in anything yet in commercially. Barton Crockett And then just switching gears a little bit. There was a recent transaction involving in the baseball area, the Mariners. And I was wondering if you had any thoughts about the applicability of that transaction as something of a comparable that we should value potentially the Braves against? Greg Maffei Well, first I congratulate my friend John Stanton who is a long-time friend and a long-time Liberty associate. We had an advisory board, for a while John was on. John Malone was on McCaw Board when John Stanton was one of the senior officers so we watched this moves with great interest and he was on the board at 360 Networks when I was the CEO of it, so we watch John with great interest and I think were happy to see his  a smart guy like him endorsing the value of baseball whether that's the right valuation for the Braves or not, Ill leave it to others but it does suggest that there is some upside in the current trading price. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Tom Eagan A follow-up on Liberty SIRI. Assuming a Sirius purchase above $500 million a quarter and Liberty doesn't participate, we estimate that you will own about 98% of it by the fourth quarter of 2019. So I guess the question is, is that a timeframe that Liberty is willing to wait for? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Greg Maffei I don't think Tom its a black or white it's interesting now I assume that has a I dont know what you have for increase in stock price there but that looks probably  that sounds kind of aggressive to me but its good math for us. And its one that I think the SIRI board will certainly take up, its unlikely that theyre going to want to have us cross up that high in percentage, I think you need to, Im not speaking for them but its just a common thought that boards would be cautious about both liquidity, there would have to be some negotiations once we cross the 80% mark for tax consolidation, so there are issues around that. Whether we wait that long or not, I think somebody else will be the judge. Tom Eagan And then a follow-up on Charter and TWC in terms of the FCC concessions. On the cable over build, do you think that might set a precedent for concessions of any other deals? Thanks Greg Maffei I first want to, if you wouldn't mind clarify. I wouldn't describe it as cable over build, I think I went out of my way and I think it's been described as a competitive over build that can be different. So, I don't know whether the FCC will use that as a model for all future transactions. Ive only paid cursory interest in what the Cablevision sudden link restrictions are but I don't believe they have a over build condition in that one to my knowledge. And I can very well be wrong but I haven't seen that described, so I don't know whether it's the model or not. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich. Matthew Harrigan BrightHouse had a trial in Florida with T-Mobile on the head net here for mobile using their small [indiscernible] facilities and T-Mobile macro cells that got pretty gloriously pulled late last year. I was just curious what the Liberty in-house thinking was on the opportunities of mobile even beyond what people are happily doing right now, and since Spectrum valuations are all [indiscernible] relevant in Denver. Do you have you had any thoughts on the auction? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think first Liberty is informed by our Chairman experienced with Liberty Global and the quad nature of the market in Europe, and certainly John is a firm believer that eventually we will get to a quad market in United States. How that's done whether that's through partnership through NVNO, through Wi-Fi First through some larger kind of operation, well see, frankly Charter has been less vocal and focused on that given its desire to get to the process on the regulatory side. So I think we are mindful of what the marketplace is in Europe, we are mindful of how the marketplace is likely to develop in United States and we'll see where we go from here. Courtney Chun Thank you to everybody who joined us this morning, we look forward to speaking to you again next quarter if not sooner and thanks for your continued interest in Liberty Media.

And with that, I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. Greg Maffei Thank you, Courtnee. Good morning to all of you out there. Today speaking on the call we will also have Liberty's CFO, Chris Shean and during the Q&A, we'll be happy to answer any questions you have about Liberty Broadband as well as the Liberty Media entities. We really won't be able to talk about Charter's 2Q results, because Charter has not yet released those, so our Liberty Broadband comments, by definition, will be somewhat limited. So, on to Liberty Media. As of yesterday's market close, the composite NAV discount of our three tracking stocks stood approximately at 13%, more or less evenly spread across all three. It's wider than we would have anticipated, especially at LSXM, but we will move forward and think about our options. On to the operational highlights. At Sirius XM first, once again they had an outstanding quarter. Subscribers increased to more than 30.6 million. Q2 revenue was $1.2 billion, up 10%, a quarterly record high. Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to $468 million. As of the 22nd of July, our ownership stake stood at about 64.8%. We're pleased with their continued progress. Live Nation also had an exceptional results. Revenue was up 23%, adjusted operating income was up 28% for the quarter and the business is on track to produce record results for the full year 2016. There are lots of exciting indicators through mid-July which give us confidence in some of those numbers and results for the full year. Concert ticket sales were pacing at 17% ahead. We have had an 18% increase in confirmed stadium, arena and amphitheater show count. Our contracted sponsorship and advertising was up 17% all good numbers. Turning now to the Braves, we completed the rights offering, raising $203 million and those proceeds were used to repay the note that the BATR entity had to the Liberty Media group. We have had some disappointing on-field results this season. We're a little better, five and five in our last 10, but the Braves do have the top-ranked farm system entering the draft, international signing periods and we've enjoyed great success in both of those draft and international signing markets. We signed six of the top 25 international prospects, including the number one-rated prospect, Kevin Maitan. And he's been dubbed the best international prospect in a decade. Battery Atlanta, the associated mixed-usage real estate project we have adjoining the new stadium, announced eight new retail restaurant and entertainment concepts that will be completed by opening day of 2017. Let me turn over to Liberty Broadband briefly. We were excited to finally close during the quarter the Time Warner Cable and Bright House transactions. And with that we completed an additional investment in from Liberty Broadband, in those combined entities. With the Charter share price up or up on an NAV basis over $1 billion on our incremental $5 billion investment, a pretty quick, good result. As I mentioned, Charter's not going to report till next week, so we're limited as to what we can say as to operating results. With that, let me turn it over to Chris Shean to talk about the financial results in some more detail. Chris Shean Thanks, Greg. As we've pointed out in prior quarters, we do consolidate Sirius XM, given our ownership, our control stake. However, we recommend that you go directly to their site and to their publicly filed documents as you evaluate that investment for us. At quarter-end, Liberty had cash and liquid investments of $1.2 billion. Included in the $1.2 billion in cash and liquid investments balance at quarter-and is $476 million held directly at Sirius XM. Liberty's consolidated cash and liquid investments, excluding the cash at Sirius XM, was $753 million. Liberty had a consolidated principal amount of debt of $7.6 billion which includes $6.2 billion of debt held directly at Sirius XM. A breakdown of attributed debt by tracking stock group as of June 30th is provided in the press release. In the second quarter, Liberty Media Group tracking stock incurred $9 million of SG&A expense, including stock compensation which excludes amounts that were allocated to each of the Liberty Sirius tracker and the Liberty Braves tracker, following the recapitalization on April 15th. For the period following the recapitalization, approximately $7 million of SG&A expense was allocated to Liberty Sirius XM Group and approximately $3 million of allocated to the Liberty Braves Group. Now, with that, I'll turn the call back over to Greg for Q&A. Greg Maffei Thank you, Chris. Well, to the audience out there, we appreciate your continued interest in the Liberty Media entities. I'd now like to open the floor for questions. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Greg, you mentioned the discount to NAV across the trackers, I don't think you guys bought any stock back in the quarter. Wondering if you could just lay out your thoughts on that opportunity. And related to that, do you think liquidity or lack of liquidity, is part of why we're seeing this discount for some or all of the trackers? And I was going to ask you about the Yankees' farm system versus the Braves, but we can take that off-line. Greg Maffei The only thing I know about the Yankees is, their payroll is surely higher. As regarding the discount, I think if you look at LSXMA and the underlying Sirius XM stock, we actually have more liquidity at LSXMA today. That's a more liquid stocks than the Sirius stock, because we're holding 65%-plus of the entity. I think one of the primarily the are a couple of reasons for the discount. One of the primary ones is the expectation that we might someday pay for that stock of Sirius with LSXMA stock and so you're better holding that and getting a premium. I think we've shown financial discipline on that point and are unlikely to overpay. Secondly and I think this is the one that's actually the biggest factor, there's a $13-plus billion market cap in LSXMA and as you rightly point out, we bought back no stock. There is a 7-ish value, 7.5 value in Sirius XM and their bought back $2 billion over the last 12 months, they are basically at a $2 billion run rate. Which one has got demand pressure, at least in the short term, that doesn't necessarily reflect long-term value, because theoretically long-term value between the two is zero, the long-term difference in the value. So, I think that's the primary reason. Are there market mechanics out there on some of these discounts around liquidity on more complicated securities because hedge funds have had less-than-exciting performance in 2016? You can conjure up lots of conspiracy theories, but I think those are the primary reasons. Ben Swinburne And I was wondering if you could comment, if you look at the music business broadly, been a lot of activity in the last quarter or two around YouTube's relationship with the labels and what the labels are thinking vis-a-vis Spotify. Any of these changes and there's also a big decision by the Department of Justice around the publishing rights. Any of these things change how you're thinking about the economics of music distribution, either for Sirius as they head into their next rate-renewal process for next year or more broadly as you look at opportunities in the marketplace to look at different kinds of businesses in the digital music space? Greg Maffei Well, I think the overwhelming drive in the digital music space is that you have several in what we consider the stream subscription space is you have several big players who are entering and are likely to further commoditize the market. Spotify did something, like, for the last year, $3.54 of ARPU per month and had 82% or 84% content costs. That sounds like a very hard business to me. And that is with Apple, Amazon, Google entering more deeply and more strongly. And Apple appears to be doubling down on their efforts on music and being more aggressive and obviously have other ways to get paid for their music business through the sale of devices and iTunes and the like. And Amazon I think is a wholly unknown variable that fully hasn't been realized, in the sense that Prime has an enormous amount of music if you are a subscriber that is embedded in that $99 annual fee. That is surely a commoditization of music. I'm not sure most Prime subscribers understand how much music they have, but as Alexa and Amazon Echo get further out there and that's a music-discovery device I think that is another hugely disruptive influence on the market. And so, I think that subscription space is very hard. We watch it very carefully. We look at some of the entities that are playing. We look at ways that we can play. Obviously some of the things where we have differentiation around ease-of-use and around our unique content are nice moats. Are they impenetrable against that commoditized music service? We surely will be affected and we think hard about how to create that moat and create value for customers that they are willing to pay for. Operator Your next question comes from the line Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Greg, just trying understand some of the tax issues across the Liberty Media structure. So, if Braves is the only ATB, do you need to get to 80% of Sirius to you will have been merged at some time in the future? And then, given that Braves is the only ATB, does that limit your ability to ever sell Braves without having massive tax leakage? And then, I know you don't want to talk about Charter's numbers, obviously. Charter's synergies are heavily tied to their programming step-downs on the Time Warner Cable rate card and there's been a couple of challenges to that. Anything you could talk about that? We would much appreciate it. Thanks. Greg Maffei So, on that ATBs, we maintain a hothouse flower plant here where we grow ATBs. And Albert's whole job is to make sure they are maturing with appropriate time. Look, I don't think we've disclosed are limitations on what we can or cannot do. Suffice it to say, more ATBs is better, it creates more flexibility, but we surely are aware of the difficulties around some of the new regulations that the IRS has put forward that may constrain our ability to go move going ahead. Nothing is impossible. We could actually even sell something taxably, but we try and maintain as much flexibility and be as tax efficient and as clever and smart and appropriate as we can here. Albert, is there anything you'd like to add? Albert Rosenthaler Nope. That's good. Greg Maffei Okay. On the question of Charter, I wouldn't claim to have spent for anything like my entire career around the cable network and cable MSO business, but the one thing I have seen in my almost 11 years at Liberty is, there are always head-butting, there is always banging heads on the what the cable networks get paid and how much the MSOs pay and those MVPDs pay. And that process whether it was Direct or whether it was Charter and always changing and the more there's consolidation, the more there are changes in ownership. There are surely points of friction that are going to be caused there. So, I have no commentary other than that's all to be expected, that people are going to try and re-contract as favorably as they can on both sides. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett Just a couple of questions, if I could. The first is, there's so much, I think, interest right now among investors in the possibility of Sirius maybe starting a dividend. I was wondering if you could remind us again on the tax implications of that for you guys. If you were to get some type of dividend from Sirius, how taxable would it be? And just your thoughts, generally, about the wisdom of that form of distribution of capital from Sirius. Greg Maffei Well, I guess I would not limit it to Sirius. In general, Liberty is not in favor of dividends, and not to say there's no condition in which we would not find that appropriate. In general, if we have an attractively priced equity, we prefer share repurchase. Why? A dividend is a forced distribution to all shareholders, not necessarily tax efficiently, perhaps tax-efficiently for some, perhaps tax-inefficiently for others. Whereas share repurchase is an optimal distribution in the sense that only those shareholders who wish to take the distributions can decide that they want to take it. So in general I think we start out with a predilection against dividends. Not to say we would never pay a dividend, but that's our view of the world. I guess there are situations where if you had no good use of capital and you didn't think your shares were attractively priced and you had some view in tax-change policies going forward, yada yada yada, you wanted to get the cash out, I could see imagining it, but I don't it's not to say we would never do it, but it just start out with a couple of strikes against it. Albert, will you want to talk about tax treatment? Albert Rosenthaler Right. On the tax treatment, it's probably an effective, say, 8% tax rate. So it's not prohibitively expensive to do so, but just as Greg pointed out, not something we're necessarily inclined to, for other reasons. Barton Crockett Okay. And then, if I could switch gears a little bit, I want to just see if there's some level that you can provide some perspective on some of the thoughts out there, that there could be some interest in consolidation around the Internet radio space. And I realize that you can't comment specifically on any press report, but just generally, given the skepticism about on-demand you've expressed, are there models out there that could be interesting and could make sense in some form of consolidation in this industry, do you think? Greg Maffei Well, Jim Meyer and we've expressed a belief before that the on-demand space is a very competitive space. There are other ad-supported models which may have protections on content costs which under some scenarios could be more attractive. That's kind of our general view, because the case where you can have the record labels dictating the full price of what the content is, rather than have it set by a regime, and they are able to ramp that up and the case where there's a lot of similar players offering on-demand services, doesn't sound very attractive. Where there are fewer players and you're competing perhaps against terrestrial radio, that may be a more attractive space to be, we'll see. Operator Questions comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong Greg, I was wondering if you can talk about Starz. I think previously you have referred to Starz as being perhaps a house-branded cable, I wonder what your thoughts are on that particular asset now and what the relationship of MVPDs are, post-merging with Lionsgate or the pending merger with Lionsgate. Greg Maffei Yes, I think what you're seeing is that there are new forms of distribution for these premium services in particular. And you're seeing new forms of distribution for the non-basic cable. You watch how Netflix is being distributed by Comcast, how Sling is being distributed by some of the other cable companies. You watch how Starz and Showtime are able to be distributed by and have traction with Amazon as an upsell from Prime. I think you're seeing a world where services which are not tied to the basic bundle have an opportunity to find new distribution, including with MPVDs which could be interesting. There are an increasing number of broadband-only households who may not choose to get the whole cable package, who may not choose to sign up for $30 or $40 worth of sports or even whatever the basic package is, and the opportunity to get premium services is an opportunity that MPVDs recognize and I think will increasingly go after. Amy Yong And then, if a transaction were to happen with a streaming music service, should we assume that it happens at the LMCA level or at the SiriusXM level? Greg Maffei I don't know how I could have been more negative on streaming services. But that having been said, Amy, I think it's highly unlikely that anything would happen at the Liberty level. Sirius is our play for the online play for music, whether it's distributed through satellite or, as Sirius already does, through the online system. Operator Our next question comes from the line James Ratcliffe with Buckingham Research Group. James Ratcliffe Two, if I could. First of all, on the topic of taxes, surprise, surprise. Once you if you get to 80% ownership of Sirius, as I understand there would be tax consolidation, are there ways to make use of the Sirius tax shields at the Liberty Media Corporation level? Or would they still be generally applied to shielding SiriusXM income? And secondly, how much if you wanted to generate liquidity at the Liberty Media Corporation/Liberty Sirius level, how much do you think you could reasonably borrow against the value of the Sirius stake, under terms, say, comparable to what you have on the current margin loans? Thanks. Greg Maffei So I'll comment on the first one, then I'll let Albert add. Once we got if we were to get to an 80% tax consolidation, we could utilize those tax losses anywhere in the consolidated tax group. A couple of caveats, first. The other shareholders would probably expect to be compensated for that, to the degree we were using them for non-SiriusXM-related activities. Secondly, if you look across the rest of the group, we don't really have much taxable income. Most of the entities we hold are non-tax-consolidated, other than the Braves, who are not huge taxpayers. And so shored-up capital gains which we try hard to avoid in terms of paying taxes on, we're not generating tons of taxable income at the Liberty Media Corporation. And so it would be less of a factor. And as I said, there would be a negotiation of sorts between how those were recognized between the non-Liberty/SiriusXM shareholders and Liberty itself. I think we have quite a lot of borrowing capacity at Sirius, against the Sirius stake. I'll ask Neal Dermer, our Treasurer, if he would like to add any thoughts. Neal Dermer Sure. Today we have $1 billion of capacity under our margin loan and we think we can maintain that. There are also other equity-linked financing options where we could raise a decent amount of incremental capital. Operator Your next question comes from the line Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet A question on the Braves. There were some press reports a couple months ago and I lost track of it, to be honest about MLB Advanced Media maybe selling a stake. And I wasn't sure if that was something that has actually occurred or if that was just press reports and nothing's been confirmed. And then second, to the extent that the Braves own one of the MLB teams, do you know how the economics would essentially flow if an asset is sold at a higher level? Is it just distributed among the various teams or is there's some more complicated mechanism? Greg Maffei Well, a couple of thoughts. Thank you, Jason. First, a stake in BAM Tech which is the non-baseball-streaming arm, but it effectively in the technology arm which in addition has gone out and cut some third-party deals, for example, with the NHL has been agreed to be sold. I don't believe it's yet been closed with Disney, valuing the BAM Tech not all of BAM, but just the Tech part at $3.5 billion. And that Disney is buying about a third, and I believe there are some and I don't think it's all I'm not giving you inside information, I believe it's been publicly disclosed that BAM Tech, there are certain ways Disney can increase its stake over time. So, that's a pretty fulsome valuation I believe for the asset and that's pretty attractive. And it suggests obviously greater value for BAM as a whole, because the business of streaming baseball online is not included in that. As far as how any proceeds would be distributed, I don't know of any plan. We're a 1/30th owner of all these things. My belief is that most of that capital that Disney is investing is intended to help grow BAM Tech and add value, rather than provide cash distributions to the teams. And that's my expectation. Operator Our last question comes from the line Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar Greg, just wanted to get your thoughts on now that the consolidation cycle on cable is more or less done with, with just a few small companies remaining, is there any logic in looking at vertical integration at entities like Charter, specifically in terms of acquiring more content? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think Charter is changed its permission dramatically from where it was when it was a 4 0.3 million cable video sub company to a 17-plus and 23 million streaming household company. And its ability to impact and drive new kinds of relationships with consumers, including around content, is very different. So I would expect not necessarily that Charter will go out and buy lots of cable networks, but that Charter will think long and hard and is thinking long and hard, about the attractive opportunities that having that scale will create for it. I'm not sure that the traditional play which frankly was pioneered really by our Chairman and TCI, of having a flywheel of positive of content and an MSO, if that traditional flywheel still exists and has the same opportunities. I think Comcast did a great job buying NBC, I'm not sure there are that many opportunities out there like that, to go buy individual cable networks or even exclude, that would be as attractive. But I do think there are going to be changing relationships between content companies. I think you're going to see people look to always do exclusives and do things that are differentiated and weigh whether they have enough scale to make that work. Examples being DirecTV and the NFL, but there are others out there. And I suspect you'll see Charter use its improved and scaled relationship with consumers to provide interesting new ways to look at content. Greg Maffei With that, operator, I think we're done. Thank you again to the audience for their continued interest in Liberty Media and its entities and we look forward to talking to you next quarter, if not sooner. Thank you. Operator Thank you.

Your first question is from the line of Ben Swinburne, Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Greg, you mentioned the discount to NAV across the trackers, I don't think you guys bought any stock back in the quarter. Wondering if you could just lay out your thoughts on that opportunity. And related to that, do you think liquidity or lack of liquidity, is part of why we're seeing this discount for some or all of the trackers? And I was going to ask you about the Yankees' farm system versus the Braves, but we can take that off-line. Greg Maffei The only thing I know about the Yankees is, their payroll is surely higher. As regarding the discount, I think if you look at LSXMA and the underlying Sirius XM stock, we actually have more liquidity at LSXMA today. That's a more liquid stocks than the Sirius stock, because we're holding 65%-plus of the entity. I think one of the primarily the are a couple of reasons for the discount. One of the primary ones is the expectation that we might someday pay for that stock of Sirius with LSXMA stock and so you're better holding that and getting a premium. I think we've shown financial discipline on that point and are unlikely to overpay. Secondly and I think this is the one that's actually the biggest factor, there's a $13-plus billion market cap in LSXMA and as you rightly point out, we bought back no stock. There is a 7-ish value, 7.5 value in Sirius XM and their bought back $2 billion over the last 12 months, they are basically at a $2 billion run rate. Which one has got demand pressure, at least in the short term, that doesn't necessarily reflect long-term value, because theoretically long-term value between the two is zero, the long-term difference in the value. So, I think that's the primary reason. Are there market mechanics out there on some of these discounts around liquidity on more complicated securities because hedge funds have had less-than-exciting performance in 2016? You can conjure up lots of conspiracy theories, but I think those are the primary reasons. Ben Swinburne And I was wondering if you could comment, if you look at the music business broadly, been a lot of activity in the last quarter or two around YouTube's relationship with the labels and what the labels are thinking vis-a-vis Spotify. Any of these changes and there's also a big decision by the Department of Justice around the publishing rights. Any of these things change how you're thinking about the economics of music distribution, either for Sirius as they head into their next rate-renewal process for next year or more broadly as you look at opportunities in the marketplace to look at different kinds of businesses in the digital music space? Greg Maffei Well, I think the overwhelming drive in the digital music space is that you have several in what we consider the stream subscription space is you have several big players who are entering and are likely to further commoditize the market. Spotify did something, like, for the last year, $3.54 of ARPU per month and had 82% or 84% content costs. That sounds like a very hard business to me. And that is with Apple, Amazon, Google entering more deeply and more strongly. And Apple appears to be doubling down on their efforts on music and being more aggressive and obviously have other ways to get paid for their music business through the sale of devices and iTunes and the like. And Amazon I think is a wholly unknown variable that fully hasn't been realized, in the sense that Prime has an enormous amount of music if you are a subscriber that is embedded in that $99 annual fee. That is surely a commoditization of music. I'm not sure most Prime subscribers understand how much music they have, but as Alexa and Amazon Echo get further out there and that's a music-discovery device I think that is another hugely disruptive influence on the market. And so, I think that subscription space is very hard. We watch it very carefully. We look at some of the entities that are playing. We look at ways that we can play. Obviously some of the things where we have differentiation around ease-of-use and around our unique content are nice moats. Are they impenetrable against that commoditized music service? We surely will be affected and we think hard about how to create that moat and create value for customers that they are willing to pay for. Operator Your next question comes from the line Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Greg, just trying understand some of the tax issues across the Liberty Media structure. So, if Braves is the only ATB, do you need to get to 80% of Sirius to you will have been merged at some time in the future? And then, given that Braves is the only ATB, does that limit your ability to ever sell Braves without having massive tax leakage? And then, I know you don't want to talk about Charter's numbers, obviously. Charter's synergies are heavily tied to their programming step-downs on the Time Warner Cable rate card and there's been a couple of challenges to that. Anything you could talk about that? We would much appreciate it. Thanks. Greg Maffei So, on that ATBs, we maintain a hothouse flower plant here where we grow ATBs. And Albert's whole job is to make sure they are maturing with appropriate time. Look, I don't think we've disclosed are limitations on what we can or cannot do. Suffice it to say, more ATBs is better, it creates more flexibility, but we surely are aware of the difficulties around some of the new regulations that the IRS has put forward that may constrain our ability to go move going ahead. Nothing is impossible. We could actually even sell something taxably, but we try and maintain as much flexibility and be as tax efficient and as clever and smart and appropriate as we can here. Albert, is there anything you'd like to add? Albert Rosenthaler Nope. That's good. Greg Maffei Okay. On the question of Charter, I wouldn't claim to have spent for anything like my entire career around the cable network and cable MSO business, but the one thing I have seen in my almost 11 years at Liberty is, there are always head-butting, there is always banging heads on the what the cable networks get paid and how much the MSOs pay and those MVPDs pay. And that process whether it was Direct or whether it was Charter and always changing and the more there's consolidation, the more there are changes in ownership. There are surely points of friction that are going to be caused there. So, I have no commentary other than that's all to be expected, that people are going to try and re-contract as favorably as they can on both sides. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett Just a couple of questions, if I could. The first is, there's so much, I think, interest right now among investors in the possibility of Sirius maybe starting a dividend. I was wondering if you could remind us again on the tax implications of that for you guys. If you were to get some type of dividend from Sirius, how taxable would it be? And just your thoughts, generally, about the wisdom of that form of distribution of capital from Sirius. Greg Maffei Well, I guess I would not limit it to Sirius. In general, Liberty is not in favor of dividends, and not to say there's no condition in which we would not find that appropriate. In general, if we have an attractively priced equity, we prefer share repurchase. Why? A dividend is a forced distribution to all shareholders, not necessarily tax efficiently, perhaps tax-efficiently for some, perhaps tax-inefficiently for others. Whereas share repurchase is an optimal distribution in the sense that only those shareholders who wish to take the distributions can decide that they want to take it. So in general I think we start out with a predilection against dividends. Not to say we would never pay a dividend, but that's our view of the world. I guess there are situations where if you had no good use of capital and you didn't think your shares were attractively priced and you had some view in tax-change policies going forward, yada yada yada, you wanted to get the cash out, I could see imagining it, but I don't it's not to say we would never do it, but it just start out with a couple of strikes against it. Albert, will you want to talk about tax treatment? Albert Rosenthaler Right. On the tax treatment, it's probably an effective, say, 8% tax rate. So it's not prohibitively expensive to do so, but just as Greg pointed out, not something we're necessarily inclined to, for other reasons. Barton Crockett Okay. And then, if I could switch gears a little bit, I want to just see if there's some level that you can provide some perspective on some of the thoughts out there, that there could be some interest in consolidation around the Internet radio space. And I realize that you can't comment specifically on any press report, but just generally, given the skepticism about on-demand you've expressed, are there models out there that could be interesting and could make sense in some form of consolidation in this industry, do you think? Greg Maffei Well, Jim Meyer and we've expressed a belief before that the on-demand space is a very competitive space. There are other ad-supported models which may have protections on content costs which under some scenarios could be more attractive. That's kind of our general view, because the case where you can have the record labels dictating the full price of what the content is, rather than have it set by a regime, and they are able to ramp that up and the case where there's a lot of similar players offering on-demand services, doesn't sound very attractive. Where there are fewer players and you're competing perhaps against terrestrial radio, that may be a more attractive space to be, we'll see. Operator Questions comes from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Amy Yong Greg, I was wondering if you can talk about Starz. I think previously you have referred to Starz as being perhaps a house-branded cable, I wonder what your thoughts are on that particular asset now and what the relationship of MVPDs are, post-merging with Lionsgate or the pending merger with Lionsgate. Greg Maffei Yes, I think what you're seeing is that there are new forms of distribution for these premium services in particular. And you're seeing new forms of distribution for the non-basic cable. You watch how Netflix is being distributed by Comcast, how Sling is being distributed by some of the other cable companies. You watch how Starz and Showtime are able to be distributed by and have traction with Amazon as an upsell from Prime.

This call also may include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding Liberty Broadband. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call and Liberty Media expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements statement contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty product broadband's expectations with regard there to or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which statement is based. Now I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. Greg Maffei Thank you Courtnee, Good morning to all of you. Today speaking on the call we will also have Liberty's CFO in his inaugural debut, Mark Carlton and during the Q&A will be available to answer questions related to Liberty Broadband as well as Liberty Media. So first, looking at Liberty Media overall I'd note one more time our composite NAV discounts persist. They're weighted a little heavily towards LSXMA and certainly wider than we would have anticipated. But of course, that can create opportunity and I expect at some point we will take advantage of that. As you likely know our big news for the quarter was our investment in and pending acquisition of Formula One. We were very excited to announce this deal back in September. Our initial investment was for 18.7% and that closed concurrent with the announcement. We also completed a 0.4% follow-on investment on October 27th. So we currently own 19.1% of the fully diluted delta topco parent and plan to close the acquisition for the balance in early 2017. As I hope you know, F1 is an iconic global motor sports business and this was a unique opportunity to own a global sports franchise of which there are very few. We see a tremendous opportunity in this business to improve performance on the operating side and the financial side in all segments whether it be venues, broadcast, or sponsorship, has opportunity to grow revenue and also develop new lines of revenue especially around digital and merchandise. Chase Carey has joined already as Chairman and is diving into the business. We think he is a perfect fit. On to the operational highlights. So at our consolidated Sirius XM which had another outstanding quarter, increasing subscribers to approximately 31 million. Third quarter revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9%, a quarterly record high and adjusted EBITDA grew 10% to $492 million. During the quarter the Company announced its intention to institute a regular quarterly dividend which came to $200 million roughly annually and increased the share buyback authorization by another $2 billion. As of October 25th, Liberty's ownership in Sirius XM stood at 65.5%. Live Nation had a record third quarter, revenue up 21%, operating income up 25% and adjusted operating income, AOI up 14%. During the quarter the Company refined its debt profile lowering the cost of its debt extending maturities. As we look ahead there are lots of exciting indicators through October, concert ticket sales pacing 14% ahead contracted sponsorship and advertising net revenue up 12% and a pipeline for 2017 looks very promising. Turning to Braves, they finished the second half of the season with a very strong performance after a very slow start. Post the all-star break we recorded a 37 and 35 record and won 20 of our final 30 games. The offense ranked fifth overall in the national league post the all-star break. We named Brian Snitker as Manager for the 2017 we're excited to have him back based on his performance in the back half of this year. We continue to make progress at SunTrust Park and the related battery at Atlanta Real Estate Development. We recently announced details for the residential portion home at the Battery Atlanta with pre-leasing beginning December 2016. We also announced additional restaurant and retail partnerships including a long-term agreement with Momozono [ph] as the official baseball gear partner with the Braves. Turning briefly over to Liberty Broadband Charter reported excellent results. Total revenue was up 7.4% with double-digit in Internet SMB and advertising obviously in part due to politics. Net income was $189 million and adjusted EBITDA was $3.6 billion, up 14.5% versus the pro forma 2015 and up 15.1% excluding transition costs incurred in the quarter. We saw strong subscriber growth in product band and video, Charter also initiated a share buyback and with that let me turn it over to Mark to talk about our financial results in a little more detail. Mark Carlton All right. Thanks, Greg. Given our 65% plus percent ownership at Sirius XM and control, its results are consolidated in with ours, to look at their results and look at their publicly traded documents you can go right to their website and see those. At quarter end Liberty Sirius XM Group at attributed cash and liquid investments of about $611 million of which $572 million has held directly at Sirius XM.  Excluding that Sirius XM amount, the group had cash and liquid investments of $39 million. The Liberty Braves Group had a attributed cash and liquid investments of $109 million and the Liberty Media Group itself had attributed cash and liquid investments of $220 million. At 9/30 the Liberty Sirius XM Group had an attributed principal amount of debt of $6.4 billion of which $6.2 billion is directly at Sirius XM. The Liberty Braves Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $220 million and the Liberty Media Group itself had attributed principal amount of debt of just less than $1.5 billion. In the third quarter the Liberty Media Group tracking stock incurred around $15 million of SG&A expense including stock comp which excludes amounts allocated to Liberty Sirius XM and Liberty Braves tracking stocks. For the quarter about $14 million of the SG&A expense including stock comp was allocated to Liberty Sirius XM Group and less than $1 million was allocated to the Liberty Braves Group. With that, I'll turn it back over to Greg. Greg Maffei Thank you, Mark. To our listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. We are excited and expect to see many of you on Thursday at our investor meeting in New York. If you haven't registered yet, you risk the wrath of Courtnee but please do so by using the link on our home page. And with that Operator I would like to open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with Pivotal. Unidentified Analyst I wanted to focus on F1. Greg, I was hoping you could comment on potential for you all to create an F1 OTT product at least to me it seems like something that could generate very attractive financial upside. Is that something you could roll out fairly quickly in the context of your F1 rights, excuse me, your F1 broadcast current rights? And then I've got a follow-up. Greg Maffei I think we're also very excited about the idea to try and utilize the massive amounts of video feed and data that we have in a premium type product and given the global nature and extremely dedicated fan base we have, it would seem like an OTT product is something that makes a lot of sense for them and us. We do have some things to work through on rights. I don't think they're impenetrable but there are things we work through and we also just need to work out relations with the teams and how we handle it all. So there's not only some work on the product side but there is some licensing work but I don't think it's insurmountable. How exactly the form of any product may take or what we may do I'm not yet sure, were still at early days but I agree, there is a lot of potential. Unidentified Analyst And then more broadly at this point, is it reasonable to assume at F1 that perhaps you may have to take a step back financially before two steps forward as you're investing or can you accelerate financial growth while you're investing? Greg Maffei I think we're still trying to get a handle on that exactly. I don't anticipate massive reduction in operating performance. There are some positives coming in including incremental broadcast revenue in some cases. But I do think we will be making some investments but part of it's in management, part of it's in areas like the OTT product that you just mentioned. I don't think those are going to be massively dilutive but I do think we will be making investments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Bryan Kraft Greg, if I understand it correctly, the Braves is the only active trader business within Liberty Media right now. My question is do you need to have an ATB within Liberty Media, what are the implications of not having one? What does that limit you from doing. When would Sirius and Formula One become ATBs? Thank you. Greg Maffei I think that's right the Braves are the only ATB though it's not actually quite true because if you look at the Braves, within the Braves the minor league teams are ATBs themselves but the Braves organization I would say holds the only ATB at the moment. The ongoing impact of that today is zero. We have an ATB. We're fine. We've learned at Liberty you can never have enough ATBs. We try to warehouse them because it creates flexibility around structuring. What does it mean in terms of when does Sirius XM become an ATB? We need to get to 80% of built-in value for five years so there are some extenuating circumstances about how you got there and at what time frames that maybe could mean Sirius could be accelerated more quickly given the history we have with it but the Formula One is a long way away. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR. Barton Crockett A couple of questions if I could. First on the arrangements with third parties for the Formula One investment. Could you just give me the rational for that. Is this mainly a way to help the owners of Formula One get cash quicker without having to be subject to lock-up or is there some idea take are using these third parties that you might get people who would be longer term investors potentially then the core holders of Formula One? Greg Maffei I think there are a couple of thoughts there. One is, yes, the CBC group, the legacy owners have been in it for a long time. We did give them some cash and they made the bet that the continued ownership stake that they hold would grow under the management of Chase and Liberty. They've gotten some of that bounce already but I think they see more upside. They're talking about potentially selling something like a third of what they have left which will leave them still with about half of what they had when we started being involved. We'll see how those exact numbers shake out. Importantly, one of the groups that's being discussed as an investor to take some of their stake, minority of their stake, is the teams themselves. And we would consider that quite a positive in terms of anchoring our relationship and aligning our interest with the teams. I also think everybody's interested in getting long-term shareholders who are potentially additive to the business but certainly expect to be in for long ride that we -- long positive ride that we are anticipating. So I think CVC and we are aligned on that. Barton Crockett And then if I could switch gears a little bit on the Liberty Sirius tracking stock. You guys for a while have called out the discount there and I'm just curious why haven't you pursued ways to do share repurchase there and in that vein now that you're getting a share of a dividend from Sirius, could that provide some liquidity for a start of a share repurchase at Liberty Sirius? Mark Carlton Well, I think we noted in the past that probably the largest single factor for why there is the discontinuity between the two stocks is the relatively larger buyback against something like $7.5 billion equity value against $2 billion run rate buyback at Sirius versus the 13-ish NAV, 11.5 market cap of the LSXMA stock and we have relatively less fire power. With the dividend we'll have more. But we've hoped that it would close of its own accord. We've hoped that people would [indiscernible] for us but may come the day when we do that work ourselves. I don't think we have yet sufficient fire power to really make it happen so we're going to pick our moment when it makes the of most sense. Operator Your next question is from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Greg, first on Charter, your ownership is split across two tickers and two different corporate entities. Does it make sense to consolidate that ownership into single entity and if so what are the pluses a and minuses and how would that possibly happen, if you had to walk through that process? And I have a follow-up. Greg Maffei Would it make sense? Absolutely. Is it simple? No. So it would involve some hurdles and hoops that I think we think about ways to do but they're not without -- there are costs or lack of opportunities or flexibility that we may lose by doing that. So we weigh those various outcomes and we think about which path we'll ultimately take. We don't have one obviously we dont have today. Would life be easier if they were all in one place? You know, I look back, if there were not four Liberty or five Liberty companies life would be easier. Sometimes you do what you can and there's other benefits and tradeoffs for having them split up and having it at different places. So we carry on. Vijay Jayant Then on Sirius itself, obviously I think this is the only Liberty entity that has a recurring dividend. So is there sort of a philosophical change there and why 1% dividend yield? What's the plan to make that like a market dividend yield going forward? Obviously you would be a key beneficiary at Liberty Sirius to close at discount with proceed. So just talk about philosophically dividend prospects at Sirius if you could. Thanks. Greg Maffei I would say in general philosophically Liberty believes dividends are not the most attractive way to return capital to shareholders. It's a forced sale of ownership rather than a voluntary one, unlike a buyback. It has tax consequences, unlike a voluntary one like a buyback. Those tax consequences I will acknowledge are somewhat mitigated by Liberty given or DRD exclusion but retail holders and many holders. Some would be non-tax but others would be fully taxable and that's probably less than ideal for them. So we have been in general lessen enthused about dividends. It's not the case that we have never had dividends, witness we already paid a onetime special dividend here at Sirius XM and I believe we've had other dividends, but I've outlined as I said a minute ago the reasons why in general we're not for them. I think the thought was in some quarters that high free cash flow perhaps attract a different segment of investors who would not come to the stock for other reasons because there wasn't a dividend. So we started with a relatively modest dividend as you noted, 1% but it's not unusual when dividends are initiated that they were at that lower end and given the growth vehicle here and nor did we want to deter from the rather large buyback in percentage terms that we are still executing upon. So weighed all that and came out with a dividend which we hope will attract some investors. There's been some positive feedback but I don't see it as a fundamental change in philosophy at Liberty. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Want to come back to Formula One maybe for Mark. At this point with the margin low and I think closing next couple of days, is the financing all in place to close the second piece of the transaction and any thoughts on permanent financing for the margin piece, it sounds like youre going to keep sort of importunity. Mark Carlton I think the financing is all in place right now. We obviously as we do with all of our companies look at financing alternatives and different ways to be more efficient at our financing and more efficient and focused with our leverage. But everything is in place now to do what we need to do and we'll keep our eye on the markets and what's happening and when the time comes certainly when we get to closing this transaction we'll be able to have a lot more direct involvement in that financing and what we do with it but we're paying attention.  Ben Swinburne And then just on tax, the tax position of Formula One as it gets folded into Liberty, very free cash flow generative business, I noted there are some tax assets, well not tax assets but losses in your proxy filing. What do you expect if any leakage in terms of upstreaming cash flow out of Formula One to the parent over time? Should we assuming that's sort of tax free? Looking at a UK tax rate? Any helpful thoughts would be helpful. Albert Rosenthaler With respect to Formula One, we retain their tax NOLs an position with respect to taxability in the UK. As we noted earlier, there are some changes anticipated in the UK tax rates and with respect to the utilization of losses and interest deductions, so that will have a modest increase in the UK taxes. We were able to set up the acquisition structure such that we do not believe there is any incremental tax on the repatriation of earnings back to the U.S. though. That should have been able to replicate their structure. Ben Swinburne And then lastly just the FIA could you maybe spend a minute on the relationship with the FIA and Formula One and whether -- I'm assuming you do but you are setting color on the approval of FIA for this transaction I think the deal closing is subject to their approval. Greg Maffei You're correct, it is subject to their approval. Chase Carey and I have met with the FI, in particular John Todd the Head of the FIA several times and had good conversations with him. Were proceeding forward with the necessary processes they have for change of control and I have every reason to believe we'll have a favorable outcome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey. Tom Eagan First on cable, Greg, with all the live OTT video offerings coming out whether it's Google or DirecTV now, how competitive do you think they can be as a real substitute for primary offering from TV operator and then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Greg Maffei I think it remains to be seen. You're seeing some traction on these but mostly subset. My understanding is for example the DirecTV now one doesn't have broadcast packages in it, so by definition that's going to reduce some segment of the market that doesn't like it. They're clearly priced competitively in the sense that it doesn't appear that there's much margin in the video content cost versus what they're charging for these folks. Maybe they're achieving some other strategy goal out of it but they are not necessarily achieving an attractive video offering price or video opportunity for themselves. We don't yet see wholesale substitution for the video package offered by cable operators and alike. Tom Eagan Right. And then separately on Liberty Media, with the investment in F1 what does that mean regarding the Live Nation investment? Does that still fit in the current vehicle and are there operational synergies between F1 and Live Nation? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think there are. I'll handle the second part first. I think there are places where Live Nation can be helpful to Formula One. There are some involvements already for example, Live Nation has helped organize concerts around some of the racing events. Live Nation has helped with some of the general venue and set-up and event processes and event ticketing and the like for example in Singapore. And there are places I think that they can be positive for each other but particularly where Live Nation can help Formula One. F1 and Live Nation are not in the same business. I think that stake is important but obviously the stake in Live Nation is smaller than the stake in the F1. We'll see where the -- what the eventual size of our F1 business will be, we will see what the right place for that asset is. We're very excited about Live Nation. The numbers they produced were great. The numbers that looking ahead look good and we think there's a lot of strategic things we can do across the Liberty family with Live Nation so it's certainly something we appreciate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar So Greg, when we look at the Liberty portfolio right now there's a number of content and distribution companies across the structure. Is there any advantage structurally or strategically to collapse this maybe into one holding company especially in the context of AT&T, Time Warner, Comcast, NBC and so on and so forth. Greg Maffei We weigh as I mentioned I think earlier, there's always some benefits to keeping things together in terms of ease of operating but there are also difficulties and challenges around what incentivizing management teams, attracting shareholder groups that are most focused on one thing or another. So we don't have any current plans or intent for that and I think we can find ways to get these groups to work together positively without certainly collapsing our current structure. Kannan Venkateshwar And secondly, I think you guys also issued a convert referencing Charter. Just wanted to understand what the thought process there was, why Charter instead of the other stocks in your portfolio and how you guys think about which equity to use for something like that. Greg Maffei Can you just repeat the first part? Kannan Venkateshwar Yes. So essentially why Charter stock for the convert instead of other stocks in your portfolio. Greg Maffei Because we had a lot of it and we didn't give up much upside and it was a very -- it was a big free liquid stock relative to the other choices so we got good execution. Doesn't speak to our views on Charter. I think we've been pretty positive on Charter. If you look at the call spread we gave, we have a lot of upside still on that Charter stock. Operator Your next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet I just had two questions. If the I remember correctly, when you created the tracker stocks under Liberty Media you cited the reason to split the Braves ownership between the Braves tracker and Liberty Media tracker because you wanted a source of liquidity at Liberty Media. On the back of Formula One transaction, is that need still there? That's my first question. My second one is when you announced the Formula One transaction I don't remember you guys ever sort of explicitly citing a value of tax assets. We just got the tax rate would be low and you could repatriate it back to the U.S. I remember that, but is there an explicit value that we're missing when we think about the value of this asset? Greg Maffei First, on liquidity, I would not describe us today compared to where we've been over the last 11 years since I've been here, about 11 years ago today actually, is highly liquid. At various times we've been really highly liquid. It's kind of like Gloria Vanderbilt, never too rich or too thin, more liquidity is a good thing. We think there will be environments going forward. We've already spoken in the past about our desire is as much as possible to find scale opportunities and utilize and build our capital up to invest in those scale opportunities. So I think this is just one more chip in that building that pile and helping us do that and it's a tax freeway to get money out of the Braves that we enjoy. On the second part, there is no explicit tax assets other than I think we have as we said an attractive low tax structure, low tax rate structure, and a full basis in our ability to repatriate capital. Mark Carlton There's some losses. As far as the overall rate is quite low given the structure we have. Greg Maffei There's not a significant tax benefit at all. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan Steve Palmer in the new contract between the Clippers and Fox Sports is really talking up the flexibility for your AR, VR, rich data, social media, et cetera, how difficult that is to accommodate and he was actually really yearning to have a smart facility like SunTrust park to move beyond the Staples center right now. You've got so much going over at F1 as well. I know they're working on Qualcomm and [indiscernible] and all that and some of these news toys. How do you feel about how the rights for new technologies and leagues, is that something -- the owners start -- the F1 is so complicated and I guess youve probably have some issues with MLB on that as well. I know it's kind of a fuzzy question but there's so much potential there. Greg Maffei I don't think we have so much of an issue at F1. We have much clearer title and much clearer paths on rights. Baseball as you rightly noted is much more complicated with divisions around the broadcasters around the teams and around them on who has those rights. I think that's more complicated. But I would also note that baseball which in some ways is the oldest and perhaps viewed in some circles as among the most stodgiest of sports has also been far and away the most advanced in terms of getting the over the top product and you have to give full credit to Bob Bowman and the BAM [ph] team for what they've done there and I think he's certainly thinking about what's the impact of VR is, what the impact of AR is and how to enhance that baseball experience. Greg Maffei Operator, I think we're through for today. Thank you very much to our listening audience. As we said, we hope to see some of you in a couple of days in New York and if not, hope to speak to you next quarter if not before. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you.

There are some positives coming in including incremental broadcast revenue in some cases.

Vijay Jayant Then on Sirius itself, obviously I think this is the only Liberty entity that has a recurring dividend. So is there sort of a philosophical change there and why 1% dividend yield? What's the plan to make that like a market dividend yield going forward? Obviously you would be a key beneficiary at Liberty Sirius to close at discount with proceed. So just talk about philosophically dividend prospects at Sirius if you could. Thanks. Greg Maffei I would say in general philosophically Liberty believes dividends are not the most attractive way to return capital to shareholders. It's a forced sale of ownership rather than a voluntary one, unlike a buyback. It has tax consequences, unlike a voluntary one like a buyback. Those tax consequences I will acknowledge are somewhat mitigated by Liberty given or DRD exclusion but retail holders and many holders. Some would be non-tax but others would be fully taxable and that's probably less than ideal for them. So we have been in general lessen enthused about dividends. It's not the case that we have never had dividends, witness we already paid a onetime special dividend here at Sirius XM and I believe we've had other dividends, but I've outlined as I said a minute ago the reasons why in general we're not for them. I think the thought was in some quarters that high free cash flow perhaps attract a different segment of investors who would not come to the stock for other reasons because there wasn't a dividend. So we started with a relatively modest dividend as you noted, 1% but it's not unusual when dividends are initiated that they were at that lower end and given the growth vehicle here and nor did we want to deter from the rather large buyback in percentage terms that we are still executing upon. So weighed all that and came out with a dividend which we hope will attract some investors. There's been some positive feedback but I don't see it as a fundamental change in philosophy at Liberty. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Ben Swinburne Want to come back to Formula One maybe for Mark. At this point with the margin low and I think closing next couple of days, is the financing all in place to close the second piece of the transaction and any thoughts on permanent financing for the margin piece, it sounds like youre going to keep sort of importunity. Mark Carlton I think the financing is all in place right now. We obviously as we do with all of our companies look at financing alternatives and different ways to be more efficient at our financing and more efficient and focused with our leverage. But everything is in place now to do what we need to do and we'll keep our eye on the markets and what's happening and when the time comes certainly when we get to closing this transaction we'll be able to have a lot more direct involvement in that financing and what we do with it but we're paying attention.  Ben Swinburne And then just on tax, the tax position of Formula One as it gets folded into Liberty, very free cash flow generative business, I noted there are some tax assets, well not tax assets but losses in your proxy filing. What do you expect if any leakage in terms of upstreaming cash flow out of Formula One to the parent over time? Should we assuming that's sort of tax free? Looking at a UK tax rate? Any helpful thoughts would be helpful. Albert Rosenthaler With respect to Formula One, we retain their tax NOLs an position with respect to taxability in the UK. As we noted earlier, there are some changes anticipated in the UK tax rates and with respect to the utilization of losses and interest deductions, so that will have a modest increase in the UK taxes. We were able to set up the acquisition structure such that we do not believe there is any incremental tax on the repatriation of earnings back to the U.S. though. That should have been able to replicate their structure. Ben Swinburne And then lastly just the FIA could you maybe spend a minute on the relationship with the FIA and Formula One and whether -- I'm assuming you do but you are setting color on the approval of FIA for this transaction I think the deal closing is subject to their approval. Greg Maffei You're correct, it is subject to their approval. Chase Carey and I have met with the FI, in particular John Todd the Head of the FIA several times and had good conversations with him. Were proceeding forward with the necessary processes they have for change of control and I have every reason to believe we'll have a favorable outcome. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tom Eagan with Telsey. Tom Eagan First on cable, Greg, with all the live OTT video offerings coming out whether it's Google or DirecTV now, how competitive do you think they can be as a real substitute for primary offering from TV operator and then I have a follow-up. Thanks. Greg Maffei I think it remains to be seen. You're seeing some traction on these but mostly subset. My understanding is for example the DirecTV now one doesn't have broadcast packages in it, so by definition that's going to reduce some segment of the market that doesn't like it. They're clearly priced competitively in the sense that it doesn't appear that there's much margin in the video content cost versus what they're charging for these folks. Maybe they're achieving some other strategy goal out of it but they are not necessarily achieving an attractive video offering price or video opportunity for themselves. We don't yet see wholesale substitution for the video package offered by cable operators and alike. Tom Eagan Right. And then separately on Liberty Media, with the investment in F1 what does that mean regarding the Live Nation investment? Does that still fit in the current vehicle and are there operational synergies between F1 and Live Nation? Thanks. Greg Maffei I think there are. I'll handle the second part first. I think there are places where Live Nation can be helpful to Formula One. There are some involvements already for example, Live Nation has helped organize concerts around some of the racing events. Live Nation has helped with some of the general venue and set-up and event processes and event ticketing and the like for example in Singapore. And there are places I think that they can be positive for each other but particularly where Live Nation can help Formula One. F1 and Live Nation are not in the same business. I think that stake is important but obviously the stake in Live Nation is smaller than the stake in the F1. We'll see where the -- what the eventual size of our F1 business will be, we will see what the right place for that asset is. We're very excited about Live Nation. The numbers they produced were great. The numbers that looking ahead look good and we think there's a lot of strategic things we can do across the Liberty family with Live Nation so it's certainly something we appreciate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar So Greg, when we look at the Liberty portfolio right now there's a number of content and distribution companies across the structure. Is there any advantage structurally or strategically to collapse this maybe into one holding company especially in the context of AT&T, Time Warner, Comcast, NBC and so on and so forth. Greg Maffei We weigh as I mentioned I think earlier, there's always some benefits to keeping things together in terms of ease of operating but there are also difficulties and challenges around what incentivizing management teams, attracting shareholder groups that are most focused on one thing or another. So we don't have any current plans or intent for that and I think we can find ways to get these groups to work together positively without certainly collapsing our current structure. Kannan Venkateshwar And secondly, I think you guys also issued a convert referencing Charter. Just wanted to understand what the thought process there was, why Charter instead of the other stocks in your portfolio and how you guys think about which equity to use for something like that. Greg Maffei Can you just repeat the first part? Kannan Venkateshwar Yes. So essentially why Charter stock for the convert instead of other stocks in your portfolio. Greg Maffei Because we had a lot of it and we didn't give up much upside and it was a very -- it was a big free liquid stock relative to the other choices so we got good execution. Doesn't speak to our views on Charter. I think we've been pretty positive on Charter. If you look at the call spread we gave, we have a lot of upside still on that Charter stock. Operator Your next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet I just had two questions. If the I remember correctly, when you created the tracker stocks under Liberty Media you cited the reason to split the Braves ownership between the Braves tracker and Liberty Media tracker because you wanted a source of liquidity at Liberty Media. On the back of Formula One transaction, is that need still there? That's my first question. My second one is when you announced the Formula One transaction I don't remember you guys ever sort of explicitly citing a value of tax assets. We just got the tax rate would be low and you could repatriate it back to the U.S. I remember that, but is there an explicit value that we're missing when we think about the value of this asset? Greg Maffei First, on liquidity, I would not describe us today compared to where we've been over the last 11 years since I've been here, about 11 years ago today actually, is highly liquid. At various times we've been really highly liquid. It's kind of like Gloria Vanderbilt, never too rich or too thin, more liquidity is a good thing. We think there will be environments going forward. We've already spoken in the past about our desire is as much as possible to find scale opportunities and utilize and build our capital up to invest in those scale opportunities. So I think this is just one more chip in that building that pile and helping us do that and it's a tax freeway to get money out of the Braves that we enjoy. On the second part, there is no explicit tax assets other than I think we have as we said an attractive low tax structure, low tax rate structure, and a full basis in our ability to repatriate capital. Mark Carlton There's some losses. As far as the overall rate is quite low given the structure we have. Greg Maffei There's not a significant tax benefit at all. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan Steve Palmer in the new contract between the Clippers and Fox Sports is really talking up the flexibility for your AR, VR, rich data, social media, et cetera, how difficult that is to accommodate and he was actually really yearning to have a smart facility like SunTrust park to move beyond the Staples center right now. You've got so much going over at F1 as well. I know they're working on Qualcomm and [indiscernible] and all that and some of these news toys. How do you feel about how the rights for new technologies and leagues, is that something -- the owners start -- the F1 is so complicated and I guess youve probably have some issues with MLB on that as well. I know it's kind of a fuzzy question but there's so much potential there. Greg Maffei I don't think we have so much of an issue at F1. We have much clearer title and much clearer paths on rights. Baseball as you rightly noted is much more complicated with divisions around the broadcasters around the teams and around them on who has those rights. I think that's more complicated. But I would also note that baseball which in some ways is the oldest and perhaps viewed in some circles as among the most stodgiest of sports has also been far and away the most advanced in terms of getting the over the top product and you have to give full credit to Bob Bowman and the BAM [ph] team for what they've done there and I think he's certainly thinking about what's the impact of VR is, what the impact of AR is and how to enhance that baseball experience. Greg Maffei Operator, I think we're through for today. Thank you very much to our listening audience. As we said, we hope to see some of you in a couple of days in New York and if not, hope to speak to you next quarter if not before. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you.

Welcome to the Liberty Media Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, February 28, 2017. I would now like to turn the call over to Courtnee Chun, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Courtnee Chun Thanks, Kayla.

This call also may include certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 regarding Liberty Broadband. These forward-looking statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this call, and Liberty Broadband expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to disseminate any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Liberty Broadband's expectations with regard thereto, or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Now I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty's President and CEO. Greg Maffei Thank you, Courtnee. Good morning. Today speaking on the call we will also have Liberty's CFO, Mark Carleton. During Q&A we will be available to answer questions that you have about Liberty Broadband as well. On January 23 we closed the Formula One acquisition. On that day Chase Carey was appointed CEO in addition to his job as Chairman. I can think of no one in the world better suited for this role. I want to once again thank Bernie Ecclestone for his efforts in building this fantastic business. Chase has added several strong players to his team, notably Ross Brawn, Managing Director of Motorsports, whose storied success at Ferrari and Mercedes is amazing. For you Americans on the call he is the Bill Belichick of F1. And Sean Bratches, Managing Director of Commercial Operations, a fantastic leader who had a huge role in building this phenomenal success at ESPN. We also received commitments in the last few days for the refinancing of the first lien term loan at Formula One. We took a full $3.1 billion first lien term loan, which was expected to be refinanced at a rate decrease of 50 basis points. The maturity date will be extended from July 2021 to the earlier of February 2024 or six months prior to the maturity of the second lien term loan, which is currently maturing in 2022. We also expect to use cash on the balance sheet to repay $300 million of the $1 billion second lien term loan. Together these actions and financings will result in annual savings around $36 million a year. We expect to close in Q1, the deal as we said, and we're working with the teams to make changes to enhance the sport and potentially invest in Formula One. We know you are all excited to talk about this, but recall this deal which I said closed in January, so is not consolidated in the Q4 results which we are here to discuss. We do plan to provide the Q4 results as soon as we put them to U.S. GAAP. In the interim we will provide a qualitative discussion in the earnings release, which hopefully you have seen. We expect that we and the Formula One management team will have more to discuss in Q2. We very much look forward to the start of this great season on March 26 in Australia. Onto the operational highlights. At SiriusXM we had another fantastic year. 2016 revenue climbed 10% to $5 billion, net income rose 46%, and adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to $1.88 billion. SiriusXM beat 2016 guidance pretty much across the board. It also generated free cash flow of $1.51 billion, up 15% as of the end of January. Liberty Media's ownership in SiriusXM stood at about 67.1%. The discount to NAV has widened, so if you like Sirius it's 15% or more off at XMA. Live Nation recorded its sixth consecutive year of record results. Revenue was up 15%, operating income up 40% and adjusted operating income up 12% at constant currency rates as compared to 2016. The Live Nation concert attendance of 71 million was up 12%, and ticket sales were up double digits year over year through February 17 of this year. Onto the Braves. The Minor League teams are again among the top ranked, if not the top ranked. Mark will go into more detail, but we are on time and on budget, and set for opening day on April 14. The Braves just received the certificate of occupancy for the new SunTrust Park from Cobb County, - a huge milestone. Over at Liberty Broadband, Charter reported strong results. In 2016 pro forma customer growth, or PSUs, were up nearly 5%, revenue was up 7%, and we experienced double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth. The network passes 49.2 million homes and businesses, currently serves 26.2 million residential and SMB customers. We are on progress - progressing on track for the Time Warner/Bright House integration, confident that we will be able to achieve the milestones that were set forward in the times that were set forward. During 2016 Charter repurchased nearly $1.6 billion of its common stock. With that, let me turn it over to Mark for more financial results. Mark Carleton Thank you, Greg. Let's start with an update of the Braves and the ballpark and the mixed-use project. Very impressive that the group down there remains on time and on budget and on track for the home opener on April 14. As of the end of the year approximately $618 million had been spent on the new ballpark, of which $373 million was provided by Cobb County and some of that, their related entities, and $245 million in debt had been borrowed by the Braves. At that same date we spent approximately $309 million on the mixed-use development, of which $46 million was provided by our joint venture partners. The remaining $256 million was provided by the Braves, of which $188 million was contributed in equity and around $68 million in debt. That project is going very, very well. At year end the Liberty SiriusXM group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $73 million. That excludes the SiriusXM's actual cash on hand. The value of the SiriusXM stock we held at that time as of 2/27 was worth $16.4 billion and has around $250 million in debt against these holdings. The Braves Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $107 million. The Formula One Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $168 million. Formula One Group holds public market securities with a market value of around $2.7 billion as of the end of on February with $2.3 billion of attributed debt. Now, we are referring to this entity as the Formula One Group, but bear in mind we did not close until January so there is no actual financial results in our December 31 2016 financial statements relative to Formula One. At year end the Liberty SiriusXM Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $6.2 billion which includes $5.9 billion of debt at Sirius. The Braves Group had an attributed principal amount of debt of $338 million. The Formula One Group had attributed principal amount of debt of $1.6 billion. In the fourth quarter the Formula One tracking stock incurred about $15 million in SG&A expense, which includes stock-based comp but excludes amounts allocated to Liberty SiriusXM and to the Braves tracking stock. For the quarter about $13 million of SG&A including stock comp was allocated to Liberty SiriusXM and about $2 million allocated over to the Braves Group. And with that, we will go back over to Greg. Greg Maffei Thanks Mark. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Media. We look forward to seeing you at the many upcoming conferences. With that, operator, I'd like to open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Thanks Greg. A couple questions. I know you don't want to talk too much about F1 until we have the results. Just more on the qualitative side, do you guys feel that the agreements you have with the teams is equitable? Some teams take a lot of money and some don't, like some of the other leagues that benefit from success of the broader league in general. Is there a chance that we could have a change in the contractual arrangements under the new leadership? Then just following up on that, obviously it seemed that F1 under Bernie was pretty much a one-man show. Now it's becoming a more professional, that may not be the right word, more corporate-wise, more talent added. How do you see margins tracking relative to the monetization opportunity? Greg Maffei Thanks, Vijay. First on the teams, as you rightly noted until 2020 we're under a Concorde agreement which sets the terms of the payments to the teams. We are hoping that with some inducements, including the stock we're offering, with some incentives around trying to create a more balanced and fair and more competitive race environment that we may see changes, but there are no guarantees of that certainly before 2020. Understandably teams that are being paid particularly well today will be reluctant to give those payments up. But I think all parties understand the need for a competitive race environment, and like the NFL, any given Sunday to see an opportunity to have teams come from behind and win, not have the usual players, not in anybody's interest to have a noncompetitive, non-interesting non-exciting sporting event. We will update you on progress of that as we move forward. On the margin side, I think everything that we thought about this business and the opportunity as we did our due diligence and the time we spent prior to purchasing Formula One has only been confirmed. There is an enormous opportunity in areas like sponsorship. There is enormous - in the short-term. There are longer-term opportunities around digital, including gamification, including virtual reality. There are opportunities in broadcasting. There are opportunities probably to create more segment around events, as I started with, but also more revenue opportunities around those events as we build to the weekend. Some of those will take time. I think in the short term we are unlikely to see margin expansion, because even though there are some near-term wins around things like advertising, over the longer term I think there are - and there's going to be expense to achieve that. Over the longer term I definitely think there's opportunities, and we will pay for that in part through things like smart financial actions like we mentioned on the savings on the refinancing. That's obviously a savings below the line on EBITDA, but those are all important for paying for what were going to do. Over the long term I think everything we thought, as I said, challenges of probably as big or bigger, but the opportunities is big or bigger than we originally thought. Vijay Jayant Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. Jeff Wlodarczak Good morning. Quick follow-up on F1. Greg, I wanted to get your thoughts on the idea of instituting team spending caps which seems, at least to me, like an obvious way to improve the profitability of the teams and maybe encourage other teams to join the series. And then I had have a quick one on Charter. Greg Maffei I think it goes part and parcel with the comments I was making to Vijay about creating a more competitive race environment and creating more excitement and creating a more stable opportunity. I think Chase has said rightly, we want the lesser ranked teams, the less successful teams, to be able to be profitable and the highly successful teams to be very profitable. But some of that is stacked today. Could you create more fairness with a race cap? Certainly something others have talked about. It will be in the execution in that and how to really make it fair, how to make it accountable. People like Ross Brawn are far more articulate on the topic, can be far more effective, I think, than many of the prior attempts. We will see how it goes. Jeff Wlodarczak Thanks. Then on Charter it sounds like the head of the SEC is circulating an order to eliminate Charter's Time Warner cable overbuild requirement concession. Do you think there's opportunities for Charter to re-review some of the other deal concessions that appear to be at odds with the new FCC's thinking, like usage-based pricing? Greg Maffei Thanks, Jeff. Just on that point, it's a fairly nuanced change, as I know you know, but for the full listening audience the change is really the requirement on where the build-out occurs and the lack of requirement that it be, as you rightly said, an overbuild, more opportunity Greenfield, more opportunity to people aren't necessarily cable players. And that is the nature of the change. It's clear that this FCC is evolving. It's clear that there are changes in how many of the doctrines that were adopted under the Wheeler of FCC will be modified. I think all bets are open to being reset in terms of things like usage-based pricing. Obviously some of the definitions of net neutrality have already been moved, and we will see further ones I suspect. Jeff Wlodarczak Thanks, Greg. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. Stepping back a little bit on F1, there was a Journal story that I thought was interesting about this broad sport talking about the pressures of NASCAR. They've had steep declines in ticket sales and viewership up on TV. Does that kind of pressure at NASCAR create an opportunity potentially to over time try and move more F1 into the U.S., or does that kind of argue maybe it's not a very hospitable environment and maybe a warning signal in your opinion? Greg Maffei Thank you, Barton. A couple things there. I think that article rightly pointed out some of the challenges that all sports want to make sure they are fresh, make sure they are differentiated, make sure they are unique product, make sure they are events, but it also suggested there are substantive and substantial differences from what we have at Formula One from NASCAR. The nature of our 21 events in 21 countries suggests far less opportunity for fatigue and overwhelming viewers and overwhelming ticket buyers in any one region because it's not available on that kind of frequency. Our positioning in the marketplace is probably less to the middle income buyer but more to the high income. We do want to broaden that but we sit up at the top of the pyramid with very - a fluent customer base, opportunities to expand that but our reach doesn't need to be nearly as deep into the customer buying public as a sport that is as broad in the United States as NASCAR. I think there are careful lessons to be learned in there, but also points out opportunities in differentiation that we at Formula One have. Barton Crockett Okay. Then on the same tracking business, with Live Nation now basically part of a racing tracking stock, is that the right place for that to sit or do you think over time there might a more appropriate place for the Live Nation stake to sit? Greg Maffei Barton, that's a great leading question. A couple of thoughts on that. First, Live Nation is an amazingly differentiated Company as well. It is both a music company, which has obviously through its management company, enormous relations particularly with artists, music artists. But it really, if you think about it another way, it is a producer of live events. It has had massive success of promoting those events. It actually has already been involved in certain races like in Singapore with helping promote Formula One. There are synergies and potentials you can imagine around what Live Nation can do and what Formula One can do. The Singapore race is considered by many to be one of our couple of three best races in terms of excitement and in terms of the full power of the event in leveraging the full audience potential. So I think there's a lot of synergies that are there that arguably are interesting around the Formula One and Live Nation space as a promoter, and also remember Live Nation is first and foremost the largest ticketing company in the world. We ticket an awful lot of events that are beyond music, NFL, many NBA, many sporting events, many other events which are non-music. Live Nation is an interesting Company. It's differentiated, it's neither a pure music fish nor a live event only fowl, nor - it's a lot of things that are very powerful. Barton Crockett Okay, great. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet Just a question for Mr. Maffei. I think at your Analyst Day in early November you lamented that LSXMA was trading at a discount to Sirius. You said you were very focused on that. You were focused taking steps to close that gap. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what the impediments have been that have prevented you from closing that gap now that four months or so has elapsed? Greg Maffei Jason, thank you for the question. I think we have talked in the past about when is the right time to do that. We have a case, as I've mentioned in the past, where Sirius is reducing the supply of stock at a faster rate than we are reducing LSXMA because frankly we're not reducing any of LSXMA during the past quarter. They have cash flows, $1.51 billion for the year of free cash flow at SXM to go and attack about $7 billion, or now I guess about $8 billion of market cap. We have very limited cash flows at LSXMA. We have quite a lot of balance sheet capacity, but we have a $14 billion or $15 billion underlying value there in stock. So we're attacking with less cash flow a larger problem. The market continues to think we're going to do something to use the LSXMA stock to take in SXM. That's the market's prerogative to think. I think the odds we do that in some way which is highly dilutive are virtually zero. So think away, but it ain't going to happen. You want to bet against us on that, you're welcome to. That's the market's prerogative, but I wouldn't hold my breath unless you've got a hell of a lot of lung capacity. I've talked about the ways we might do that and I've also talked about the impediments to doing that, and then I've talked about when it would make the most sense. While that's all happening, SXM is continuing to increase our ownership in SXM because we are not sellers, we are believers in the business. It's nice to see the endorsement of holders like Berkshire Hathaway buying both LSXMA stock and SXM stock. It's an opportunity for us. It's one we'll take advantage of in the time and place of our choosing Jason Bazinet Can I ask one follow-up? Are there any sort of complexities that arise once your ownership in Sirius gets to 80%? Can you remind us of those, if there are any complexities? Greg Maffei I think the largest complexity, which is not overwhelming, is we need to have some sort of tax-sharing agreement which is fair to the minority holders. That's not an unusual situation. It's one that can be worked out relatively easily. I don't think it's one that will take an enormous amount of debate or contention if we get to that point. Jason Bazinet Okay. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of John Tinker with Gabelli & Company. John Tinker Hi, thank you. Couple of quick questions on the Braves. Could you talk a little more about the timing of the opening of the mixed-use development, some of the real estate, the residential, the commercial? And when you will actually see cash flows from them coming through? Secondly, there was some speculation recently on the Miami Marlins. Could you give us your view as to what valuation of baseball teams is at the moment? Thanks. Greg Maffei I'll comment first a little bit on the Battery and I will let Mark add to that. Then I will comment on the Marlins as well. As I think we said, San Diego Padres on April 14 opening home day, opening day for the new stadium. I expect Battery will be operating in part. Not every retail site will be completely leased, but several and many will, and many of the other parts of the venue, commercial real estate are well underway and leased, I think. The expectation is Comcast I think will take occupancy in November, but Mark Carleton can correct me, or somebody else. While the Battery will be partially open as a retail site there are continuing efforts to expand that, that will be beyond the April 14 opening day for the stadium. On the Marlins valuation, the $1.6 billion, there are scuttlebutt that may be an inflated number, that maybe a nameplate number that doesn't reflect real economic - excuse me, represent real economic value. We will see. Obviously no deal has been announced. It was only rumored, and now there are rumors that it's not happening to that group at that price, so who knows. I would posit to the proud order that the Atlanta Braves, one of the most storied and longest franchises in baseball, frankly in professional sports in the U.S., would be far more valuable than the Marlins given our fan base, given our opportunity, given the new stadium, given the potential TV revenue ahead, given the breadth of the radio coverage, many, many factors, that we would be more valuable than the Marlins whatever price is eventually printed, if it is. Mark Carleton Certainly, Greg, that it is our belief in terms of where our team is right now in terms of payroll, where our prospects are and our minor league system is, the number of pitchers that we have in that system. But those numbers are not surprising to us. The business of baseball is very, very good and there's a lot of value in those teams. We will see where the Marlins end up, but we were not surprised at some of the numbers that were being thrown around. In terms of the Battery, we will have a number of the food and beverage and retail stores open at the end of the month, or at the end of March coming in - and in April. We have intentionally held back some of that space, and not on purpose leased everything out to have some spot market opportunities for what we think is a good growth market. All of this is phased, the residential is in a different phase, some of the other phases of retail and buildings are all in the plans. This will be an ongoing three- to five-year kind of an organization to build it out. The Live Nation music venue will be open. We will have ample food and beverage and retail that will be open. I think they have managed the capacity and the leasing and the contracting quite thoughtfully. John Tinker Thanks. Greg Maffei Thank you John, thank you Mark. Next question please. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Kannan Venkateshwar Thank you. Greg, on Charter essentially there was a speculations around Verizon and Charter sometime back, and obviously reacted to that. How do you think about wireless from your perspective, given the currency that you have in Charter at these levels as well as the scarcity of assets on the wireless side, especially for the incentive auction expectations? If you could walk us through your thoughts on wireless, that would be good. Greg Maffei I think it's a great question. It's an evolving one. First and foremost our belief is that the broadband market and position that cable has in video in broadband is probably fundamentally more attractive than the wireless business where the competition around price, around effectively things like data caps which are just a form of price are all much more vociferous than the competition currently we're expressing in the broadband market. In addition, Charter sees enormous opportunity in just executing on its plan. The plan around Time Warner integration, Bright House integration full digital video, simplified packaging, simplified pricing, upgrades and speeds at broadband, all those we think are a great plan. So when you talk about the currency of Charter, I think one of the things that the shareholders, major shareholders like Bright House and ourself, and I suspect Tom is a major shareholder personally. I think is our currency is going to get more valuable over time, not less, as we execute on that plan. Fundamentally we are in a very good business. Longer term, is it fairly clear there is a consolidation in wireless and wireline and those merge? Yes. The time frames are less than clear, the opportunities continue to open up in new ways. There are other players out there with spectrum, there are other players are rumored into the market all the time, like Google. I think Tom and team are testing our entry into wireless through things like our MBNO and wi-fi first products. Whether ultimately we find the opportunity to do something around a more complete wireless play, we will see. I think that doesn't need to be decided today. I think whatever happens we will be in a stronger position six months, nine months, two years from now than we are now in terms of having a currency that is able to execute on a acquisition with stock, if that's what's necessary. Kannan Venkateshwar All right. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from the line Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Tom Eagan Great, thank you. A follow-up on the FCC question. The current FCC is certainly looking to lighten the load for cable, but the FCC hasn't signaled any interest in getting involved in either retransmission fee hikes or still allowing the programmers to block the broadband access to their sites. Any thoughts on relief on these two issues? Thanks. Greg Maffei Let me just first Tom, if I might, if I can take the liberty of rephrasing your description. Tom Eagan Sure. Greg Maffei I would not - lighten the load, I would say it's leveling the playing field. Things like the work on privacy where the requirements for what the players, Silicon Valley players, Google, Facebook, et cetera, what their privacy requirements were, were considerably less than was being asked of companies like Charter. And the FCC has done things to level that playing field, rather than - it may have the impact of lightening the load, but I think it's a question of basic fairness on how players are treated. As far as things like re-trans, I believe that Commissioner Pai and his brethren are likely to think about free market solutions rather than trying to use their regulatory hammer as much as possible to solve those problems. I wouldn't imagine that re-trans is top order in terms of using - them coming in and using a heavy hand in fixing that. But we will see. Tom Eagan Is it your understanding that programmers could still - they can still block broadband subscribers access to their sites, right? Greg Maffei The latter point I think is a very fair one. The larger re-trans question I think is a thorny one. I think the latter point is - you're excellently very fair. When take programmer X says that a broadband subscriber from a cable company with whom they don't have a video relationship can't visit the online site. I would think that most people, most Americans including our FCC Commissioners would find that pretty offensive. Tom Eagan Right. Okay. Thank you. Greg Maffei That's a fairly narrow case. That was my point. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Ross with BTIG. Brandon Ross Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Greg, on the Sirius call we asked Jim Meyer about the public difference in attitude on a potential Pandora acquisition between yourself and Sirius management, and he responded that there is no disagreement between Liberty and Sirius on that asset. Does that mean that you both want to buy Pandora? I assume you would never buy P at the Liberty level? Greg Maffei I will take the first part - I will take the second part first, rather. I would think there's virtually zero chance that we would do anything at the Liberty level that does not involve Sirius. We work in conjunction with Sirius. I think Jim's comments are right on. Jim and I are - you couldn't put the thinnest wedge between Jim and I on our belief in Pandora. Interesting asset that has not clear that the valuation makes sense, full stop. I think we have been consistent in that. At the right price, interesting. Not clear this is the right price. Frankly I think that whether it's Pandora holders or whomever have hyped that we're going to be there to bid. I wouldn't hold my breath at these levels. Again, my comments are, you can hope all you want. Whether there is a price that meets expectations and whether we're going to execute on it, that's another matter. Brandon Ross Great. Thank you. Operator Your last question comes from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich Securities. Matthew Harrigan Thank you. Riding on the drafting on Vijay's questions to an extent. There's some talk in the European business press about the F1 strategy group having a lot of meetings and being pretty re-energized. I guess there's a little hype down before on some the perspective engineering changes. So without tossing out a lot of acronyms, you see a lot of activity there that could be energizing in the short term. Then there's specific situations on the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and then obviously [indiscernible] in terms of retaining and getting back those races in that latter German track, I guess, is particularly iconic for the sport. Thank you. Greg Maffei I think first there are many players in this, which makes it complicated from the FIA to the teams to the many - you mentioned the F1 strategy group to - there are a lot of players. I think fundamentally Chase and Ross Brawn are at the center of trying to make these races more interesting, more competitive, more exciting. I think there is uniformity about many of the actions that it will take to do that. Whether we can execute on those, how long it will take, that it's still open. But I think there is a lot of consensus around ideas that could make this sport more compelling to the benefit of all players, teams, fans, regulators and the F1 commercial entity. So a lot of alignment on those, execution is not as easy. As we said, or as I said, there are many players in here. But getting agreement, getting consensus on actual action items is not always as easy, but I'm optimistic. On the teams - or rather on the tracks you mentioned like Silverstone and like the German track, one of the things we need to do is make, as I said, the races more compelling and exciting, and more beneficial to promoters. Take best practices, what worked in exciting races like Mexico City, like Singapore, like Abu Dhabi, bring those best practices across the globe to traditional tracks, which may not have had either as much financing capability, but also just don't have as exciting a product at the moment. There are always tracks that go in and out. It is most negative when you have some of our traditional Western European tracks, which are at the heart of the fan base like in Germany, go out. But there is already progress to bring them back, and as you may recall, we added the Ricard track in France, another place where we have been gone for several years, which is the origin of Formula Un is in France and in England. We are big believers in making sure places like Silverstone and the French track and the German track are on the race calendar and are exciting events which are beneficial to all the players. Matthew Harrigan Thanks Greg. Greg Maffei So with that, operator, I think we are good for the morning. Thank you all for your interest in Liberty Media. As I said, we hope to see you over the coming months at the many events that we are speaking at and on the next earnings call a quarter away. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Vijay Jayant Thanks Greg. A couple questions. I know you don't want to talk too much about F1 until we have the results. Just more on the qualitative side, do you guys feel that the agreements you have with the teams is equitable? Some teams take a lot of money and some don't, like some of the other leagues that benefit from success of the broader league in general. Is there a chance that we could have a change in the contractual arrangements under the new leadership? Then just following up on that, obviously it seemed that F1 under Bernie was pretty much a one-man show. Now it's becoming a more professional, that may not be the right word, more corporate-wise, more talent added. How do you see margins tracking relative to the monetization opportunity? Greg Maffei Thanks, Vijay. First on the teams, as you rightly noted until 2020 we're under a Concorde agreement which sets the terms of the payments to the teams. We are hoping that with some inducements, including the stock we're offering, with some incentives around trying to create a more balanced and fair and more competitive race environment that we may see changes, but there are no guarantees of that certainly before 2020. Understandably teams that are being paid particularly well today will be reluctant to give those payments up. But I think all parties understand the need for a competitive race environment, and like the NFL, any given Sunday to see an opportunity to have teams come from behind and win, not have the usual players, not in anybody's interest to have a noncompetitive, non-interesting non-exciting sporting event. We will update you on progress of that as we move forward. On the margin side, I think everything that we thought about this business and the opportunity as we did our due diligence and the time we spent prior to purchasing Formula One has only been confirmed. There is an enormous opportunity in areas like sponsorship. There is enormous - in the short-term. There are longer-term opportunities around digital, including gamification, including virtual reality. There are opportunities in broadcasting. There are opportunities probably to create more segment around events, as I started with, but also more revenue opportunities around those events as we build to the weekend. Some of those will take time. I think in the short term we are unlikely to see margin expansion, because even though there are some near-term wins around things like advertising, over the longer term I think there are - and there's going to be expense to achieve that. Over the longer term I definitely think there's opportunities, and we will pay for that in part through things like smart financial actions like we mentioned on the savings on the refinancing. That's obviously a savings below the line on EBITDA, but those are all important for paying for what were going to do. Over the long term I think everything we thought, as I said, challenges of probably as big or bigger, but the opportunities is big or bigger than we originally thought. Vijay Jayant Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line Jeff Wlodarczak with Pivotal Research. Jeff Wlodarczak Good morning. Quick follow-up on F1. Greg, I wanted to get your thoughts on the idea of instituting team spending caps which seems, at least to me, like an obvious way to improve the profitability of the teams and maybe encourage other teams to join the series. And then I had have a quick one on Charter. Greg Maffei I think it goes part and parcel with the comments I was making to Vijay about creating a more competitive race environment and creating more excitement and creating a more stable opportunity. I think Chase has said rightly, we want the lesser ranked teams, the less successful teams, to be able to be profitable and the highly successful teams to be very profitable. But some of that is stacked today. Could you create more fairness with a race cap? Certainly something others have talked about. It will be in the execution in that and how to really make it fair, how to make it accountable. People like Ross Brawn are far more articulate on the topic, can be far more effective, I think, than many of the prior attempts. We will see how it goes. Jeff Wlodarczak Thanks. Then on Charter it sounds like the head of the SEC is circulating an order to eliminate Charter's Time Warner cable overbuild requirement concession. Do you think there's opportunities for Charter to re-review some of the other deal concessions that appear to be at odds with the new FCC's thinking, like usage-based pricing? Greg Maffei Thanks, Jeff. Just on that point, it's a fairly nuanced change, as I know you know, but for the full listening audience the change is really the requirement on where the build-out occurs and the lack of requirement that it be, as you rightly said, an overbuild, more opportunity Greenfield, more opportunity to people aren't necessarily cable players. And that is the nature of the change. It's clear that this FCC is evolving. It's clear that there are changes in how many of the doctrines that were adopted under the Wheeler of FCC will be modified. I think all bets are open to being reset in terms of things like usage-based pricing. Obviously some of the definitions of net neutrality have already been moved, and we will see further ones I suspect. Jeff Wlodarczak Thanks, Greg. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. Stepping back a little bit on F1, there was a Journal story that I thought was interesting about this broad sport talking about the pressures of NASCAR. They've had steep declines in ticket sales and viewership up on TV. Does that kind of pressure at NASCAR create an opportunity potentially to over time try and move more F1 into the U.S., or does that kind of argue maybe it's not a very hospitable environment and maybe a warning signal in your opinion? Greg Maffei Thank you, Barton. A couple things there. I think that article rightly pointed out some of the challenges that all sports want to make sure they are fresh, make sure they are differentiated, make sure they are unique product, make sure they are events, but it also suggested there are substantive and substantial differences from what we have at Formula One from NASCAR. The nature of our 21 events in 21 countries suggests far less opportunity for fatigue and overwhelming viewers and overwhelming ticket buyers in any one region because it's not available on that kind of frequency. Our positioning in the marketplace is probably less to the middle income buyer but more to the high income. We do want to broaden that but we sit up at the top of the pyramid with very - a fluent customer base, opportunities to expand that but our reach doesn't need to be nearly as deep into the customer buying public as a sport that is as broad in the United States as NASCAR. I think there are careful lessons to be learned in there, but also points out opportunities in differentiation that we at Formula One have. Barton Crockett Okay. Then on the same tracking business, with Live Nation now basically part of a racing tracking stock, is that the right place for that to sit or do you think over time there might a more appropriate place for the Live Nation stake to sit? Greg Maffei Barton, that's a great leading question. A couple of thoughts on that. First, Live Nation is an amazingly differentiated Company as well. It is both a music company, which has obviously through its management company, enormous relations particularly with artists, music artists. But it really, if you think about it another way, it is a producer of live events. It has had massive success of promoting those events. It actually has already been involved in certain races like in Singapore with helping promote Formula One. There are synergies and potentials you can imagine around what Live Nation can do and what Formula One can do. The Singapore race is considered by many to be one of our couple of three best races in terms of excitement and in terms of the full power of the event in leveraging the full audience potential. So I think there's a lot of synergies that are there that arguably are interesting around the Formula One and Live Nation space as a promoter, and also remember Live Nation is first and foremost the largest ticketing company in the world. We ticket an awful lot of events that are beyond music, NFL, many NBA, many sporting events, many other events which are non-music. Live Nation is an interesting Company. It's differentiated, it's neither a pure music fish nor a live event only fowl, nor - it's a lot of things that are very powerful. Barton Crockett Okay, great. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Bazinet Just a question for Mr. Maffei. I think at your Analyst Day in early November you lamented that LSXMA was trading at a discount to Sirius. You said you were very focused on that. You were focused taking steps to close that gap. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a bit on what the impediments have been that have prevented you from closing that gap now that four months or so has elapsed? Greg Maffei Jason, thank you for the question. I think we have talked in the past about when is the right time to do that. We have a case, as I've mentioned in the past, where Sirius is reducing the supply of stock at a faster rate than we are reducing LSXMA because frankly we're not reducing any of LSXMA during the past quarter. They have cash flows, $1.51 billion for the year of free cash flow at SXM to go and attack about $7 billion, or now I guess about $8 billion of market cap. We have very limited cash flows at LSXMA. We have quite a lot of balance sheet capacity, but we have a $14 billion or $15 billion underlying value there in stock. So we're attacking with less cash flow a larger problem. The market continues to think we're going to do something to use the LSXMA stock to take in SXM. That's the market's prerogative to think. I think the odds we do that in some way which is highly dilutive are virtually zero. So think away, but it ain't going to happen. You want to bet against us on that, you're welcome to. That's the market's prerogative, but I wouldn't hold my breath unless you've got a hell of a lot of lung capacity. I've talked about the ways we might do that and I've also talked about the impediments to doing that, and then I've talked about when it would make the most sense. While that's all happening, SXM is continuing to increase our ownership in SXM because we are not sellers, we are believers in the business. It's nice to see the endorsement of holders like Berkshire Hathaway buying both LSXMA stock and SXM stock. It's an opportunity for us. It's one we'll take advantage of in the time and place of our choosing Jason Bazinet Can I ask one follow-up? Are there any sort of complexities that arise once your ownership in Sirius gets to 80%? Can you remind us of those, if there are any complexities? Greg Maffei I think the largest complexity, which is not overwhelming, is we need to have some sort of tax-sharing agreement which is fair to the minority holders. That's not an unusual situation. It's one that can be worked out relatively easily. I don't think it's one that will take an enormous amount of debate or contention if we get to that point. Jason Bazinet Okay. Thank you.

I guess there's a little hype down before on some the perspective engineering changes. So without tossing out a lot of acronyms, you see a lot of activity there that could be energizing in the short term. Then there's specific situations on the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, and then obviously [indiscernible] in terms of retaining and getting back those races in that latter German track, I guess, is particularly iconic for the sport. Thank you. Greg Maffei I think first there are many players in this, which makes it complicated from the FIA to the teams to the many - you mentioned the F1 strategy group to - there are a lot of players. I think fundamentally Chase and Ross Brawn are at the center of trying to make these races more interesting, more competitive, more exciting. I think there is uniformity about many of the actions that it will take to do that. Whether we can execute on those, how long it will take, that it's still open. But I think there is a lot of consensus around ideas that could make this sport more compelling to the benefit of all players, teams, fans, regulators and the F1 commercial entity. So a lot of alignment on those, execution is not as easy. As we said, or as I said, there are many players in here. But getting agreement, getting consensus on actual action items is not always as easy, but I'm optimistic. On the teams - or rather on the tracks you mentioned like Silverstone and like the German track, one of the things we need to do is make, as I said, the races more compelling and exciting, and more beneficial to promoters. Take best practices, what worked in exciting races like Mexico City, like Singapore, like Abu Dhabi, bring those best practices across the globe to traditional tracks, which may not have had either as much financing capability, but also just don't have as exciting a product at the moment. There are always tracks that go in and out. It is most negative when you have some of our traditional Western European tracks, which are at the heart of the fan base like in Germany, go out. But there is already progress to bring them back, and as you may recall, we added the Ricard track in France, another place where we have been gone for several years, which is the origin of Formula Un is in France and in England. We are big believers in making sure places like Silverstone and the French track and the German track are on the race calendar and are exciting events which are beneficial to all the players. Matthew Harrigan Thanks Greg. Greg Maffei So with that, operator, I think we are good for the morning. Thank you all for your interest in Liberty Media. As I said, we hope to see you over the coming months at the many events that we are speaking at and on the next earnings call a quarter away. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines.

And thank you for all of you for joining us today for our conference call. We are going to review the financial results we released last night for the first quarter of 2015 and provide a business update before the Q&A session. The speakers today are Peer Schatz, our Chief Executive Officer; and Roland Sackers, our Chief Financial Officer. On slide two, you will see the customary Safe Harbor Statement explaining that the discussion and responses to your questions on this call today reflect managements view as of today, May 06, 2015. We will be making statements providing responses to your questions that state our intentions, beliefs, expectations and predictions for the future. And these constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provisions. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. QIAGEN disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. For more information, please refer to our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Also during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these figures to GAAP measures is available in the press release and presentation. I would like to now hand over to Peer. Peer Schatz Thank you, John. And welcome to all of you. We are very pleased with our start to the year and have these messages to summarize our performance. First, we achieved our targets for the first quarter. As you saw in the press release, adjusted net sales rose 2% at constant exchange rates while adjusted EPS was $0.24 also constant exchange rates and ahead of our target of $0.22 to $0.23 per share. Reported results were obviously and as respected, impacted by currency headwind but we are currently rather well hedged due to our global cost base and Roland will discuss this shortly. Second, we are moving ahead on transforming QIAGEN. Our results continue to be impacted by the sharp decline in sales of HPV products in the United States. And in this quarter, they were down 54% and created approximately 6 percentage points of headwind. This was in line with expectations. The good news is that sales from the rest of our business rose 8% on a constant exchange rate basis in the quarter. The top seven emerging markets were an important incremental growth contributor, rising 22% constant exchange rate as a group, and led by China and turkey both growing at very double digit growth rates in the quarter. We delivered sales growth in all customer classes. In molecular diagnostics, we saw solid underlying sales gains on the back of contributions from our growth drivers. The applied testing customer class also continued to advance at a high single-digit constant exchange rate pace while academia and pharma showed low single-digit constant exchange rate improvements. One of the highlights was the expansion of our liquid biopsy portfolio, both through the addition of new sample technologies for circulated tumor cells or CTCs and a new co-development collaboration with Tokai for a companying diagnostic in prostate cancer patients, and I will come back to this topic later. We also have a number of important product launches underway in the franchise or our QuantiFERON technology which enables customers to detect very challenging signals not possible with other diagnostic technologies. We have a deep pipeline of tests in development using this QuantiFERON technology that built on the current portfolio to address needs in detecting TB or cytomegalovirus and also QuantiFERON monitor for use in assessing and monitoring the immune system. Third, we are reaffirming our full year guidance and we continue to anticipate higher adjusted net sales and the earnings at constant exchange rates. Based on current exchange rates, we continue to expect an adverse currency impact on full year results. We also have set goals to deliver improved free cash flow and here you see the 40% gain in the first quarter and for operating margin for the full year. And I would like to mention a point not on the slide. Ulrich Schriek, a member of the Executive Committee and the Head of Corporate Business Development for 18 years is moving into a new role as a Senior Advisor. Ulrich played a profound role in shaping QIAGEN and has built a formidable team that has enabled QIAGEN to attract breakthrough technologies in top companies. We are very pleased to announce the internal promotion of Jean-Pascal Viola, who is currently Vice President, Global Head of M&A and Corporate Ventures, to become Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Business Development and Intellectual Property & Litigation, and report directly to me. JP has been with QIAGEN since 2005 and has been responsible to some of our most value creating transactions including the acquisitions of Cellestis for QuantiFERON, the access for our expansion in personalized healthcare and Corbett to gain access to the Rotor-Gene Q for PCR technology. Moving to slide five. On the right hand side, you see a breakdown of the sales performance for the first quarter and the approximately 6 percentage points of headwind from this U.S. HPV franchise. Following the decline over the past few years as well as in this quarter, it is now down to about 4% of total sales. As for 2015, we continue to expect U.S. HPV sales to create about 3 to 4 percentage points of headwind for the full year. As other offerings entered the market, we have been successful in maintaining our leadership position in HPV testing albeit at the substantially reduced price levels induced by these new entrants. What is important here is that we see 2015 as the final year of significant headwinds because most of the contracts now reflect the new pricing and this is being annualized. The revenue contributions are also now down to 4%, so it is reaching a level but even a significant change would not have a material impact on the overall company. At the same time, you see the rising share of sales from our growth drivers and how these products are creating a foundation for the next growth wave. The efforts weve made over the last few years are coming to an inflection point and this is why we changed our strategic framework at the start of 2015, using the sample to insight theme. Helping customers gain insights is ever more critical for QIAGEN and this is at the heart of our portfolio spanning sample technologies, assay technologies, bioinformatics and automation platforms. We want to increasingly offer our customers seamless integrated solutions to go from our raw biological sample to valuable insights that can be utilized for clinical decision making or for scientific breakthroughs. I am now on slide six to provide some highlights on the growth drivers in the first quarter. I want to start with our latent TB test, QuantiFERON. And the European rollout is gaining momentum for the fourth generation version of this modern gold standard test. The U.S. submission is also in preparation. Also of note was the use of QuantiFERON in a groundbreaking clinical trial involving more than 21,000 people in Chain and the results were published in The Lancet. Each person was tested with both the old skin test and QuantiFERON-TB Gold. And the results show that the skin tests significantly overestimated the prevalence of the disease in China. The results with QuantiFERON which is highly accurate, showed the real prevalence and this is at levels where latent screening becomes highly effective compared to just looking for active TB cases. This is why the authors recommended community-based screening using modern blood test technology to detect latent TB with preventive treatment for infective patients were most at risk for developing active TB. The rollout of QuantiFERON is underway in China and these study results will support our campaign. On the QIAsymphony automation platform, we are moving towards our goal of 250 new placements in 2015 which would put us at over 1,500 cumulative placements at the end of the year. We added eight new tests to this portfolio during 2014 including tests for the most common healthcare associated infections, plus new companion diagnostic and were aiming for further submissions this year. In bioinformatics and next generation sequencing, were moving ahead to expand our offering with universal solutions while also preparing for commercialization of the GeneReader NGS workflow later in 2015. As we noted in the release, the integration of the Enzymatics portfolio is moving along very quickly and were pleased with the customer response. Enzymatics has very high brand awareness among these customers, given that these products are used in about 80% of our next generation sequencing workflows. Were also expanding our bioinformatics franchise through new commercialization agreements. One of the recent deals was with GATC, a leading European sequencing service provider. They are now providing full access to the ingenuity variant analysis solution to GATC customers. And you saw that we just announced this week a very important agreement with BGI under which the data generated for their customers will also go through this ingenuity variant analysis solution. These partnerships are very exciting, as they underscore the value of our bioinformatics solutions as a standard for the delivery of valuable molecular insights from sequencing data. I am now on slide seven and would like to provide some deeper insights on the expansion of our position in the liquid biopsies, an area with dynamic potential that is getting a lot of mainstream media attention. As a reminder, liquid biopsies involve taking a body fluid most often in blood to gain access to nucleic acids meaning DNA and/or RNA and making them available for downstream analyses using various technologies including PCR and next gen-sequencing. This is why we talk about liquid biopsies being a type of our logical sample that is opening up new processing techniques. Three main types of targets are found in blood, pre-circulating nucleic acids, exosomes and circulating tumor cells. With solutions addressing all three of these targets which also involve the use of our QIAGEN automation platforms, weve built a substantial market share lead in this fast growing area and this obviously also builds on our overall leading market share in sample technologies. As an example, liquid biopsy solutions are enabling new uses for established biomarkers and here you can think of the therascreen EGFR test used as a companion diagnostic. This test is available for use with tissue samples as well as also for liquid biopsy samples. Another example is enabling new uses from new assays and here you could think of non-invasive prenatal screening and the emergence of new oncology tests. These tests are also offering new ways to expand and improve care along the patient care continuum. Think of caring for a cancer patient and being able to use liquid biopsy starting with disease screening through to diagnosis and then on to recurrence monitoring. Another key advantage of liquid biopsies is that you can get both tumor related and normal DNA from a patient with one blood drop. And furthermore you can also distinguish between somatic or acquired mutations from germline or hereditary mutations based on the Allele frequency obtained through deep sequencing. There are also obviously some disadvantages at this time with this technology such as the need for high sample volumes as well as in terms of the results with current sensitivity levels and also in some cases, specificity but these will be addressed as liquid biopsies develop. On slide eight, you see an overview of the categories for liquid biopsies and our offerings. Personalized healthcare is clearly the hottest area for liquid biopsies and were building on our leadership and the use of our sample technologies for liquid biopsies to set new standards in non-invasive prenatal testing. This is reflected in the fact that we now have five final projects in place based on this new sample technology. During the first quarter, we added the AdnaGen portfolio of sample technologies for use in gaining access to circulating tumor cells. And as part of that agreement, we signed a new company-development collaboration with Tokai for their late stage investigational drug for castration resistant prostate cancer. And as you know in January, we also launched the first ever regulated CE-IVD for liquid biopsy companion diagnostic and lung cancer with AstraZeneca and their therapy IRESSA. One of the most interesting developments was based on data that research is presented at the European Lung Cancer Conference in Geneva in April. The ASSESS study used QIAGEN sample technologies to gain access to 1,162 matched tissue and blood samples from lung cancer patients. The comparison of the EGFR testing of the sample showed an 89% agreement between the blood and the tissue tests. What is remarkable is that this study was not performed in specially selected central labs but instead in local labs that are used to daily clinical routine and show more a real world situation. One of the study also set cell-free DNA detected in the bloodstream of cancer patients represents an excellent tool to examine genetic alternation that are usually found through tissue tumor testing. This represents one of the most astonishing phenomena in biology. As we have said before we see liquid biopsies as very important trend and well further develop this leadership position. As the same, it may take some time to see this technology become more standardized in clinical diagnostics and that will require more studies like these to considerably open up the opportunity. With that, Id like to hand over to Roland. Roland Sackers Thank you, Peer. Good afternoon to everyone in Europe, and good morning to those joining from the U.S. Im now on slide nine and will being with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. In terms of adjusted net sales, we delivered on our goal for 2% growth at constant exchange rates and the currency headwind of about 8 percentage point was more than our estimate in January for 6 to 7 points. This led to the 6% decline in the reported sales compared to the first quarter of 2014. The acquisition of Enzymatics which was completed late December and BIOBASE in our in our bioinformatics franchise, provided about 2 percentage points of growth by the underlying organic growth of about 6% constant exchange rate was essentially offset by headwinds from U.S. HPV franchise. Consumables and related revenues were up 2% constant exchange rate in the quarter and provided 88% of sales and absorbed the lower U.S. HPV sales. Instruments kept up a solid pace with 9% constant exchange rate growth in the quarter and provided 12% of sales. Moving down to income statement, adjusted operating income declined 10% and the adjusted operating margin declined to about 23% of sales from 24% a year ago. As for the cost areas, the adjusted gross margin improved by about 60 basis point due to improving product mix and efficiency gain. At the same time, we increased incremental investments to support the growth driver, in particular next generation sequencing and bioinformatics as we also step up investment in our commercialization activities and e-commerce initiatives. This led to higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales and this was the main reason for the decline in the adjusted operating margin. To address the issue of currencies based, on the rates we saw during the quarter, we actually had a slightly positive impact on the margin from the currency movement. This was due mainly to the weakening of the euro against the dollar and the fact that we have a cost overhang in euros which means more cost and sales in this currency. So, based on the current constellation of currencies, we are not seeing an adverse impact on the operating income margin. For the full year, we have a goal of operating income margin improvement of at least 50 basis points from the 25% margin in 2014 that excludes the restructuring charges taken in the first quarter and this is also at actual FX rate. Adjusted net income fell 4% and this included the benefit of a lower adjusted tax rate of 19% which was a guidance rate we had given for the quarter compared to 22% a year ago. In terms of adjusted EPS which was 20% per share at constant exchange rates, we exceeded our goal by $0.01 and reported results were reduced by about $0.02 due to exchange rates. Weve seen a reduction in the share count of 5.5 million shares compared to the first quarter of 2014 and this included the repurchase of the convertible bond in 2015 as well as impact of the ongoing share repurchase program over the last 12 months. Another metric is cash flow generation and we had a strong quarter with 40% improvement in free cash flow. This shows were generating an increasing level of cash from the business and starting to see more benefits from our efficiency program. Moving to slide 10, I would like to provide you with a quick overview of results for the four customer classes. As noted earlier, the result in these customer classes included contributions from the Enzymatics and BIOBASE acquisitions. Molecular diagnostics continued its growth pace even in the light of U.S. HPV headwind, until you see the core MDx portfolio grew about 14% at constant exchange rate. The biggest contributions came from the growth driver. We saw ongoing double digit constant exchange sales expansion for the QuantiFERON latent TB test and also shipped solid consumer score on our portfolio of assets by infectious disease testing for which the QIAsymphony system plays a critical role. Our personalized healthcare franchise also recorded gain in the quarter on higher sales of the therascreen and ipsogen companion diagnostic kits and the pharma co-development project also generated higher revenues. In the life science, applied testing grew in line with our high single-digit constant exchange rate goal, with the strongest gain coming in human ID and forensics and across all regions. The performance in the pharma customer class has to be seen against the very strong 8% constant exchange rate growth in the first quarter of 2014 but was largely in line with the full year 2014. Academia growth came on the back of improving demand in U.S. and Europe but this quarter we saw some softening of trends in the Asia Pacific region and Japan. For 2015 we expect customer sentiment in the U.S. and Europe could be equal to or better than in 2014 but for funding levels to still be below levels seen a few years ago. Im now on slide 11 to review our adjusted sales in the first quarter on a regional basis. The top seven emerging markets returned to their old stronger form, generating 22% growth at constant exchange rate in the quarter and providing about 12% of total sales. China showed a dynamic performance of growth rate of above 20% constant exchange rate and the same was also seen again in Turkey. On the other hand, Russia continues to be very challenging. In terms of the reason the Europe, Middle East and Africa region continue to deliver robust gains with 9% constant exchange rate growth and contributing about one third of our sales. I already mentioned Turkey but we also saw improving trends in Southern Europe and also some important incremental growth from the Middle East. Molecular diagnostics sales grew at double-digit pace and applied testing aided to the overall regional gains, whilst pharma had softer results. The Americas grew 8% when excluding the headwinds from U.S. HPV sales and this was due to growth in the U.S. and Brazil from the rest of the portfolio. The Asia Pacific and Japan region also had solid performance, the 7% constant exchange rate growth and contributing about one-third of our sales. Even though sales in Japan were stable year-on-year, we again benefitted from this robust performance in China. Moving to slide 12, I would like to briefly touch on our strong financial status and how we are using it support the business expansion while increasing returns to shareholders. On the right side of the slide, you see our leverage has now increased to about 1.5 times net debt to EBITDA which is the target we had given you in January. And we continue to have good liquidity and a manageable net debt position. A key reason for the increased leverage was our decision to repurchase 2024 convertible notes at a cost of $250 million. About $190 million of this was paid in the first quarter and the final payment of about $60 million was made in April. But remember that we have been moved about 10 million shares of dilution risk. Also we plan to soon resume the third $100 million share repurchase program. We still have about $50 million remaining in this tranche. We also intend to ask as usual for the standard shareholder approval at the upcoming annual general meeting in June for authorization on further share repurchases. Im now on slide 13 to provide some comment on the full year guidance which we have reaffirmed. We continue to expect full year sales growth of about 4% at constant exchange rate. This is based on generating about 7% to 8% points of constant exchange rate growth from our core portfolio against the final year of significant headwinds from our U.S. HPV product. We have taken a conservative view with our expectation for about 3 to 4 percentage points of headwinds for the year. For Adjusted EPS, we continue to expect about $1.16 to $1.18 per share on a full year basis at constant exchange rate. These expectations also take into account the contributions from the Enzymatics acquisition and there is still about $20 million of incremental sales in 2015. Moving to slide 14. There you see the details of our guidance for the full year and also for the second quarter. About 2% constant exchange rate growth in the first quarter, our outlook for the second quarter is 4% growth at constant exchange rate. This takes into account about 4 to 5 percentage points of headwinds from the U.S. HPV franchise compared to about 6 points in the first quarter and for the rest of the portfolio to continue growing at about at about 8% constant exchange rates. In terms of adjusted EPS, we are expecting $0.26 to $0.27 per share also at constant exchange rates for the second quarter compared to $0.25 a year-ago. The top question is obviously our view on currency impact. As you have heard from other companies, the headwinds became evident at the end of 2014 and got worse during the first quarter. Given the volatility, this is why were providing constant exchange rate for the quarter along with some FX indications based on currency risk for the period. For the second quarter and based on rates as of April 30, the headwinds are expected to become more severe at above 10 percentage points. So, given the outlook for 4% constant exchange rate growth, it implies about a 6% decline in reported sales. As for adjusted EPS, we noted in the release that exchange rates expected to reduce at constant exchange rate result by about $0.02 per share and no adverse impact on the adjusted operating margin is currently expected. This slide also contains adjustment assumptions for the year and the second quarter and they are largely at the same levels we provided for the first quarter of the year, especially on the adjusted text rate at 19% and about 236 million shares. With that I would like to hand back to Peer. Peer Schatz Thank you, Roland. I am now on slide 15 for a quick summary before we move into Q&A. Let me review what we have announced. First, we delivered a solid overall performance in the first quarter of 2015, having achieved our targets for improvements in adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates by successfully executing on our strategy focused on delivering innovation and growth. We are also moving ahead on initiatives to transform QIAGEN through our growth drivers. Weve had some important new product launches in the quarter, particularly in the QuantiFERON franchise and we are working on a number of new product launches and market expansion opportunities to further strengthen our portfolio. All of this is in line with our ambitious target to offer sample to insight solutions to our customers. The benefits of these efforts will become more apparent during the course of 2015 which is shaping up to be a good year. And as Roland just outlined, were reaffirming our guidance for the higher adjusted net sales and earnings per share at constant exchange rates. As with other companies, reported results will adversely be affected by currency movement. With that I would like to hand back to the operator for the Q&A session. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.  Anne Edelstein This is Anne Edelstein calling in for Derik. Just a few brief questions maybe on some of your growth drivers like the bioinformatics platform is actually in light of the two announcements that you made this quarter. So maybe just -- how do you think about the clinical opportunity as you move the bioinformatics platform from the recent academic setting into the clinic? Peer Schatz This is clearly a big initiative that we currently have underway. We have the phenomenal franchise used by double-digit thousands user base in the research area for tools including real-time PCR and next-gen sequencing. That knowledge base however is universally applicable also into clinical applications. And we therefore have a fantastic opportunity now link that also some of our diagnostic activities. And we have increasingly started to bundle also in the companion diagnostics area but also in routine clinical diagnostics bioinformatics solutions with assays with lab work. This is ultimately part of the package. So, we have a very good access to the user base clearly in topology but also across as the areas of molecular diagnostics. And with such a powerful knowledge base and our new tool emerging, our clinical decision support tool, we have a very unique opportunity to be the first mover with a very widely adopted tool in the research markets into this new merging area of complex genomic interpretation and analysis. So, this is within the bioinformatics area which is one of our five growth drivers. This is one of the most important initiatives for 2015 to continue to roll this out. The preliminary testings have been very positive and feedback has been fantastic. It is something were very much looking forward report on as it further enrolls. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Just two quick ones, if I can. First on QuantiFERON, can you maybe just give us a sense of how we should think about the ramp of the fourth-gen test, any update on timing for the Gold Plus U.S. submission and then QuantiFERON Monitor, you kind of introduced that as a concept last quarter, just wondering if you could kind of talk about timelines. And then bigger picture, just stepping back, I mean kind of trying to get people comfortable to the underlying growth in the business ex-HPV. So Peer, maybe based on what you laid out, do you see a path to kind of sustainable high single-digit organic growth and call it 2016 and beyond, and what in terms of the pipeline is a big swing factor there? Is it sequencing; is it liquid biopsy, Im just trying to get comfortable with the longer-term trajectory beyond the HPV headwinds? Peer Schatz So, the first is, question was around the QuantiFERON launches. We launched fourth-gen in Europe, also some other countries; its been CE marked and the uptake has been very good. It is clearly something that takes time. There is a well established base of QuantiFERON-TB Gold users, the TB Gold Plus features which include easier workflow, include higher specificity, include also features that were currently validating to give indications on risk of progression into active TB. These are very, very unique features and giving us a significant competitive advantage and making it much easier to also convert skin test users into our product. That is something that just takes time, it needs conversion; it needs education on these new feature and further clinical studies and also support by the research and clinical communities. So, this will be an ongoing effort over the next few years and youll see both products partly working in parallel also in the markets for some time. We wouldnt necessarily see that that would something that you would see on the revenue base, creating significant blips or jumps in terms of sales, but youll see this trajectory that we currently have which is good double digit growth and the QuantiFERON franchise which is north of $100 million in sales already, continue for the foreseeable future. Monitor has also been CE marked in Europe. And this is such a fundamentally new concept; its quite revolutionary that weve seen enthusiastic by first key opinion leaders on the capabilities of this product. But this is something that were bundling with our transplant and our immunology targets that include molecular and QuantiFERON assays and that bundle has been working very well. Actually at tradeshow just this week we have received phenomenal support by the transplant community. In terms of sustainable growth going forward, we have been recording high single digit, even double digit growth for the past quite a few quarters already, ex HPV headwind; weve maintained our leadership position in HPV albeit at a lower revenue base. And that headwind from the pricing -- primarily the pricing decline has dissipated. With that the company will have its much higher growth rate on the rest of the franchise exposed. And we believe that the nature of the growth drivers which is very long-term sustainable growth will therefore impact the overall growth rates significantly, meaning yes we are definitely poised to move up the top line growth significantly, doesnt depend on any specific pillar but we have five pillars and they all are long-term trajectories, QuantiFERON; QIAsymphony; personalized healthcare; bioinformatics; and next-gen sequencing, all have a strong contribution to that long-term growth. This is not a one product story but were very well established company that builds insights -- contributes to insights for our customers and this is across different pillars and product areas. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Thanks very much for taking my questions, just two please quickly. Firstly, financial question just relates to the operating margin in the quarter, which is around 23% and probably a little bit weaker than we were anticipating. I appreciate the commentary around 25.5% adjusted operating margin flow for 2015. But I just really wanted to get a feel for how youre thinking about 2016. I think you had some long standing targets out there for around a 27% margin, implying then a 150 basis points expansion on 2015. Im just wondering if you could square some of the comments you made about increasing investments in liquid biopsy clinical trials potentially with such a spot launch costs for next-gen. Second, a quick follow-up was just on the GeneReader platform, pretty encouraging to see you hit some various development milestones. Just wonder whether you could shed some light on when we likely to understand a little bit better about this project and when will you showcase it, how far along are you within the commercial business plan, such that we can start seeing revenue contribution from this product? Roland Sackers Yes, as I said on the call, we thought also during the first quarter that we had a very good start into year and at the same time were quite excited about the pipeline we are having. So we saw at the same time also to prepare ourselves for all the activities once that get our report and things on our ways, so we invested quite significantly in a one hand side in sales and marketing activities and launch activities, but also at the same time especially on bioinformatics, NGS has a lot of additional requirements for example IT infrastructure. So, we are able to accomplish a lot of this in the first quarter. At the same time, I would like to reconfirm that if you are also quite strongly about margin improvement for 2015 for the middle and long term. So given the actual fix environment, we do believe that we should be at least able to improve our overall EBIT margin around 50 basis points, hopefully more and midterm we feel quite comfortable, we can reach up to 100 basis points growth year-over-year. Again this is of course without any currency impact which is always hard to predict. Operational efficiency, we could see not only in the EBIT level, but also in the gross margin level, a lot of the things which we did over the last 18 months are now also trickling through and giving us not only benefits on the P&L side but also on the cash flow side. So, I am pretty quite optimistic that we are able to improve our overall profitability quite nicely going forward. Peer Schatz Your question on the GeneReader, we did say today that the development is progressing as planned were targeting launch later in 2015. This is all reiterating what we previously said. The performance specs in many ways are already a visible kind of today because we have panels already in markets. When these studies that came out in the first quarter that show that or panels hence down beat the current gold standard in the market in terms of ease-of-use and coverage specificity and sensitivity. The goal of our development programs is not develop a sequencer but to make sure that customers who want to use our panels will have a samples inside workflow and the goal is to still make sure that the performance that they are used to seeing on other platforms today can be replicated on our workflow with world-class bioinformatics and the interpretation solutions to create the icing on the cake. And this data is already visible today and what gives you a pretty good hint where we think we will be hope to be later this year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein from William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein I wanted to go back into bioinformatics a little bit. Can you give us some idea about the dollars that that is generating right now and are there other areas that you need to round out? Obviously, youve made a number of acquisitions there, but just any updated thoughts on that? And then, can you talk about within the various product lines there, how youre getting paid today? Peer Schatz Good question, well the easy one is what is the revenue base that we currently have? Its approximately 4% of our sales base and seeing significant growth. The growth is really across all customer classes, very strong base in the research areas, clearly through the legacy products, ITA, also Ingenuity Variant Analysis or the CLC workbenches but were seeing strong adoption and in the mean time the clinical markets and that is driving a lot of the growth and actually across our customer classes but in particular our clinical will be15 strong growth contribution. Its very difficult to assess that we have everything we need in such as dynamic and fast moving environment. But if we look at what were out to do is to create solutions that allow our customers to create valuable insights from complex molecular data, not only with the wet lab but also with the so-called dry lab or bioinformatics solutions. We have a very, very strong pipe already that we can put on to a wet lab solutions to create exactly that experience. So, if we take a very focused or narrowly focused view, yes we have everything underway for what we need now in the near term but as its obviously dynamic market with new potentials emerging and we are settling these opportunities as part of our overall strategy. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan I just wanted to get any commentary on the HPV market internationally and just your outlook there, sort of the opportunities for greater penetration versus how the competitive environment looks and any changes there? Peer Schatz Thanks. Its almost there is -- there are like two heads of the HPV story, one is the story in the Unites States; the other story is against all expectations and I think against everything that you normally would expect. The incumbent product, namely our product, is a very strong market leading solution with a majority of the market and has transitioned this now into a new pricing level which is fairly lower than -- substantially lower than what we saw a few years ago. And its a story very different ex-U.S. We are hands down beating competition in almost every large screening program because were -- if you look at competing products, the specification, the headline specifications just dont live up to the requirements of a primary screening campaign in large populations. And were in the meantime undertaking several national screening programs that we have really announced this. And frankly because there is a lot of emotion around this whole portfolio in the United States, weve refrained from creating a lot of announcements about actually tremendous success that were having outside the U.S. winning and implementing national screening campaigns in very sizable countries where were talking about millions of women being screened. So, this is a continued long and bright future that we have with this portfolio. And were continuing to invest in it. As the leader, we also see the responsibility to do that. Story in the United States will start stabilizing later this year. We have therefore I think an interesting situation next year where were going to be talking about growth rates in HPV and not HPV headwinds that were due to some irrational behaviors in the market. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Peer, on the liquid biopsy portfolio or business, is it your impression that there is basically a large group of companies that are putting together strategies here for liquid biopsy diagnostics or is it at this point are really the big cancer players that are pushing hard here. And maybe as a follow-up to the bioinformatics discussion and as it relates to BGI, is BGI looking to incorporate Ingenuity Clinical or is it pretty much fairly into the research projects at this point? Peer Schatz So, the first question on liquid biopsy, there are pillars of our strategy. The one pillar is that were enabling almost every player in the market with liquid biopsy solutions on the front end. So every time you read about liquid biopsies being used in novel tests and new companies emerging using this new approach to create new types of tests, you will almost always see our sample technologies either the manual solutions on QIAamp, on QIAcube or also now on QIASymphony being used on the front end. They are pretty much ubiquitous. Our market shares on the front and are staggering. And thats something that were investing in heavily actually and you see also the breadth of solutions we have in the meantime. There is no other company that can easily jump between exosomes and circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA, because the battle is not which of the three is better but the ultimate value proposition is where can we create most value per patient and that often depends. And the ability to move to different sample technologies or introduce different approaches continues to be very valuable by our customers. Thats a one strategy, absolute leadership and sample technologies for liquid biopsy. The second strategy is that were selectively integrating that into horizontal workload combining with some of our tests as well and benefiting just like were enabling other customers as well benefitting from this new approach for our own tests. And this includes existing tests like the EGFR portfolio; there are many others that were using in the meantime. They include for instance the compatibility of our next generation sequencing panels are liquid biopsy ready. This is unique. And while others fiddle around with different region combinations and different workflow combinations, weve immediately created compatibilities for both FFPE, primary sample type and liquid biopsy solutions for our GeneReader workflows. And we see a tremendous amount of momentum in this market. I think it will take some time to make sure that we are creating the right performance specifications in this market to really replace some of the existing assays or some of the new promises because early diagnostics very often look good and that proof is in the pudding and extensive validations. And this will be very, very important because were talking about diseases that are in many cases life threatening. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird GmbH. Please go ahead.  Jeff Elliott First one here is on the QIAsymphony. In light of all the assays youve been adding to that over the past couple of years, can you give us an update on where the installed base is at in terms of the mix between molecular diagnostics and applied customers and what they have reported right now on that platform? Peer Schatz Its interesting to hear that Baird just turned into a GmbH; are you inverted into Germany? The QIASymphony portfolio is about two-thirds clinical and a third life sciences. The majority of the life science placements are however in the area of the applied testing, in particular forensic. We have some very interesting solutions for forensic customers. So, almost all from our industrial. Were increasingly seeing a strong uptake in next generation sequencing labs because the QIAsymphony has unique capabilities to do high molecular weight, nucleic acid purifications which is very difficult to do and we have some unique protocols that are in the QIASymphony reflected that purpose. In addition, we have the ability to run also the liquidity biopsy technologies on the platform as well. So, the breadth and the quality of the sample types is very amenable to next generation sequencing and were seeing good uptake there as well. And that is both clinical and life science, but again the majority clinical, two-thirds clinical and the third lifeline, majority of that applied. The menu breadth in Europe is very significant and we are continually upgrading it. We had a big upgrade last year in hospital-acquired infections, have the full menu there actually, some very novel tests that are not available from any other player in this market, and have seen very good traction there are well. In the United States, the menu remains very limited. Well continue to put menu onto the platform, but were more integrating select FDA approved product with broader use in laboratory developed testing where the breadth and the flexibility of the platform is unrivaled and this is giving us good traction in the U.S. And if you look at the placements, there are actually significant approaching 50/50 I guess U.S. and rest of the world and this trend will probably continue that way. The pull-through is something that depends very much on the market. Were seeing very strong growth in consumable and asset pull-through, very high double digit growth in this space. But on the overall franchise, pull-through is still south of 100,000 which considering that there is a big LDT base, its actually very good. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard So Peer, just hoping you could offer some color on what youre seeing in the pharma market. That was the slowest growth of your customer class this quarter, but it seems like many of your peers are talking of pharma as a source of strength, so hoping you could help me reconcile. Peer Schatz Yes, its a good question and to understand that the first part of the answer will be that there are different parts of supplies into pharma, so one is for instance in the area of production and quality control. Were starting to see good ramp up of biologics and also therefore good expansion of the use of these tools. And this is an area that we have some exposure to but not really a lot. Our primary exposure is into the early stage research and/or preclinical research and the other half is in the areas of clinical research. And clinical research is continuing to do very well. Were seeing good growth rate. The preclinical is very, very compressed due to cost saving measures and so that trend that started almost 10 years ago, that is just continuing. In addition, were seeing some lumpiness. There are quarters where you have a big clinical trial and then you have big orders coming through and then that can impact the quarter $1 million or $2 million in sales, from that percentage of revenue will have a big impact. Were very committed to this because of the porosity into the clinical world especially through the companion diagnostics franchise. Its sometime difficult for us to allocate between these two areas, but the expectation is that were going to see lower to mid single digit growth in the pharma market probably over the as a long-term trend. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel I have three, let me just rattle through them real quick. First, I believe you previously guided us to expect 60 basis points to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year, net of 30 basis points to 40 basis points of FX. I believe guidance is now for 50 basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. In your prepared remarks, you indicated there will be no incremental impact of FX on margin, if I have all these observations accurate, whats the change here? Thats the first question. The second question is, on the last quarterly call you indicated that FX would reduce EPS by I think it was about $0.05 to $0.07 on a reported basis for the full year. Based on current rates would the impact on EPS now be about $0.10 to $0.12 on a reported basis? And my third question is constant currency consumables growth was about 2%. As we try to assess the puts and takes, can you breakout what the growth rate was for bioinformatics and M&A. Im just trying to get at organic consumables growth excluding HPV, M&A and bioinformatics. Peer Schatz Let me try the first one and I guess background took my brain and I will do the third one at the same time. On profitability I think at the end of day nothing really has changed if it comes to operating margins, if you look at the final outcome what -- I think what we said earlier this year is of course it is a hard to predict where currency is going to go and therefore we strongly speak to our constant exchange rate guidance in terms of revenue as well as in terms of EPS and what we did is giving all this indication for the next quarter. Having all said, what weve seen on the first quarter at the end of day that on the one hand-side, we actually got some field in terms of impact on our margins and that was mainly driven by the relationship between euro and U.S. dollars on the one hand side as we do have a cost overhang in euro that is actually beneficial for us. At the same time, what we have seen which is clearly a quite significant change for us as well as is that currency relationship between U.S. dollar and Swiss francs [ph] improved which is also important one for us. So that was the reason how we ended on our Q1 results. If you would take now the April currency rates, actual currency rates of April as a given for all through rest of 2015, we do believe that we will have an actual rate probably at 50 basis points improvement for the full year 2015. And therefore I think were in line and what we said also on our mid and long-term guidance. Again we are right now running on full speed and that is driven by couple of this significant launches, Peer described before. On the EPS side, things are even I would say have improved for us compared to what we have seen and said during our January call and guidance. Because what we said today is that we have seen on $0.02 EPS impact for the first quarter on currency and we expect around 0.02 EPS impact for the second quarter. But of course if you look on the currencies and how they move in 2014 and fourth quarter this impact is going to diminish in a larger way. So, the overall impact is probably coming down quite a bit. And again I dont want to get too precisely because nobody knows exactly how currencies are moving. But again using April base, you probably have some around $0.02 for the second six months of 2015 in currency impact. So then on the one hand side if you look at our guidance is somewhere between $1.16 to $1.18 EPS for 2015 on current exchange rate. And Ive given you right now lets say around $0.06 or $0.07 EPS that is clearly better than quantum right now as I see the list. The third question was on the revenue growth rate. As we said on the script at the end of the day, we have an overall growth rate of 2.3% for the quarter and at the end of the day, we had a contribution from the acquisitions of around on 2% as well. Nevertheless it includes of course HPV franchise, so, ex-HPV organic growth rate was around 6% and growing over the course of 2015, we do expect that its going to be incrementally to improve. Bioinformatics has a solid growth rate so far as Peer indicated before and with now being [indiscernible] so we feel quite strongly about that as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of William Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William Quirk Two questions. First one is giving the experience that QIAGEN has in diagnostics and certainly in sample prep, where do you see the greatest uptake in the near-term for liquid biopsy and then what applications do you think will take longer to develop? Peer Schatz Its something were thinking a lot about because there are lot of applications that look kind of interesting but will probably require a lot of validation. And as you well know, there has been  very often take a lot of money and a lot of the time and ultimately not lead to the results that we all expect. We see the market currently by far dominated by prenatal testing. This is the earliest form of high volume liquid biopsy testing that emerged. And that will -- its clearly a growth driver and will continue to be a growth driver for many years. And that will probably be the largest in terms of volume for quite some time. The next set is emerging as -- are not these very complicated fancy new tests but are actually existing tests that have been well validated in controlled clinical trials using primary tissue. And where we can then do a side by side like we did with the ASSESS study with AstraZeneca, where you basically have the tumor and the liquid biopsy sample running parallel and can do concordance studies. That is going to be much strong. I think that is underestimated in the public thats actually where there is a bigger trend right now. And the third area Id say these very complex new tests that are emerging for indications that previously were not testable, only very difficult to do. That is going to take some time to validate and become high volume routine tests over time. So commercially thus far the largest existing test in prenatal moving into liquid biopsy. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff One follow-up question on the liquid biopsy test development. Can you comment on how many developments like percentage-wise which I assume is the broad indication in oncology and what other indications are being pursued? And second question on the QuantiFERON-TB test, on the back of what youve said in the call, would you be comfortable to achieve a more than 20% growth for this test in sales in 2015 again? Peer Schatz The first question is follow-on to what we just talked about before with Bill is again the majority is currently prenatal testing and the various types of tests are emerging out of that and the secondary are the existing tests, very often single marker test but also next-gen sequencing panels in the meantime. And the newer tests will take some time to emerge. So oncology is by the most that were seeing right now but were also starting to see some other indications emerge but its -- the majority is oncology. The QuantiFERON franchise, the revenue base that we have today its over $100 million, its continuing to grow very rapidly into the market with new products are coming. We wouldnt going to put any expectations on prior growth rate but the market is vast. And this is not a market that will suddenly snowball and start accelerating in growth rates. As routine with other similar tests in the past, you will probably see a trajectory, a long-term sustainable trajectory of penetration into the market. Over 50 million skin tests being done a year. The market is just expanded with higher prevalence countries now certainly become economically and clinically very viable areas to implement like TB testing and significantly expands the market size. And with that the growth rates definitely have a lot of support in terms of the environment, the market opportunity to also be able show very strong double-digit growth. I wouldnt want to put out a number right now, were going to do that every year but the long-term trajectory is definitely -- I wouldnt expect this to suddenly decelerate or suddenly accelerate, but very much continue like this.

And our first question today comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.  Anne Edelstein This is Anne Edelstein calling in for Derik. Just a few brief questions maybe on some of your growth drivers like the bioinformatics platform is actually in light of the two announcements that you made this quarter. So maybe just -- how do you think about the clinical opportunity as you move the bioinformatics platform from the recent academic setting into the clinic? Peer Schatz This is clearly a big initiative that we currently have underway. We have the phenomenal franchise used by double-digit thousands user base in the research area for tools including real-time PCR and next-gen sequencing. That knowledge base however is universally applicable also into clinical applications. And we therefore have a fantastic opportunity now link that also some of our diagnostic activities. And we have increasingly started to bundle also in the companion diagnostics area but also in routine clinical diagnostics bioinformatics solutions with assays with lab work. This is ultimately part of the package. So, we have a very good access to the user base clearly in topology but also across as the areas of molecular diagnostics. And with such a powerful knowledge base and our new tool emerging, our clinical decision support tool, we have a very unique opportunity to be the first mover with a very widely adopted tool in the research markets into this new merging area of complex genomic interpretation and analysis. So, this is within the bioinformatics area which is one of our five growth drivers. This is one of the most important initiatives for 2015 to continue to roll this out. The preliminary testings have been very positive and feedback has been fantastic. It is something were very much looking forward report on as it further enrolls. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Tycho Peterson Just two quick ones, if I can. First on QuantiFERON, can you maybe just give us a sense of how we should think about the ramp of the fourth-gen test, any update on timing for the Gold Plus U.S. submission and then QuantiFERON Monitor, you kind of introduced that as a concept last quarter, just wondering if you could kind of talk about timelines. And then bigger picture, just stepping back, I mean kind of trying to get people comfortable to the underlying growth in the business ex-HPV. So Peer, maybe based on what you laid out, do you see a path to kind of sustainable high single-digit organic growth and call it 2016 and beyond, and what in terms of the pipeline is a big swing factor there? Is it sequencing; is it liquid biopsy, Im just trying to get comfortable with the longer-term trajectory beyond the HPV headwinds? Peer Schatz So, the first is, question was around the QuantiFERON launches. We launched fourth-gen in Europe, also some other countries; its been CE marked and the uptake has been very good. It is clearly something that takes time. There is a well established base of QuantiFERON-TB Gold users, the TB Gold Plus features which include easier workflow, include higher specificity, include also features that were currently validating to give indications on risk of progression into active TB. These are very, very unique features and giving us a significant competitive advantage and making it much easier to also convert skin test users into our product. That is something that just takes time, it needs conversion; it needs education on these new feature and further clinical studies and also support by the research and clinical communities. So, this will be an ongoing effort over the next few years and youll see both products partly working in parallel also in the markets for some time. We wouldnt necessarily see that that would something that you would see on the revenue base, creating significant blips or jumps in terms of sales, but youll see this trajectory that we currently have which is good double digit growth and the QuantiFERON franchise which is north of $100 million in sales already, continue for the foreseeable future. Monitor has also been CE marked in Europe. And this is such a fundamentally new concept; its quite revolutionary that weve seen enthusiastic by first key opinion leaders on the capabilities of this product. But this is something that were bundling with our transplant and our immunology targets that include molecular and QuantiFERON assays and that bundle has been working very well. Actually at tradeshow just this week we have received phenomenal support by the transplant community. In terms of sustainable growth going forward, we have been recording high single digit, even double digit growth for the past quite a few quarters already, ex HPV headwind; weve maintained our leadership position in HPV albeit at a lower revenue base. And that headwind from the pricing -- primarily the pricing decline has dissipated. With that the company will have its much higher growth rate on the rest of the franchise exposed. And we believe that the nature of the growth drivers which is very long-term sustainable growth will therefore impact the overall growth rates significantly, meaning yes we are definitely poised to move up the top line growth significantly, doesnt depend on any specific pillar but we have five pillars and they all are long-term trajectories, QuantiFERON; QIAsymphony; personalized healthcare; bioinformatics; and next-gen sequencing, all have a strong contribution to that long-term growth. This is not a one product story but were very well established company that builds insights -- contributes to insights for our customers and this is across different pillars and product areas. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Bardo of Berenberg. Please go ahead. Scott Bardo Thanks very much for taking my questions, just two please quickly.

So, I am pretty quite optimistic that we are able to improve our overall profitability quite nicely going forward. Peer Schatz Your question on the GeneReader, we did say today that the development is progressing as planned were targeting launch later in 2015. This is all reiterating what we previously said. The performance specs in many ways are already a visible kind of today because we have panels already in markets. When these studies that came out in the first quarter that show that or panels hence down beat the current gold standard in the market in terms of ease-of-use and coverage specificity and sensitivity.

And this data is already visible today and what gives you a pretty good hint where we think we will be hope to be later this year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Brian Weinstein from William Blair. Please go ahead. Brian Weinstein I wanted to go back into bioinformatics a little bit. Can you give us some idea about the dollars that that is generating right now and are there other areas that you need to round out? Obviously, youve made a number of acquisitions there, but just any updated thoughts on that? And then, can you talk about within the various product lines there, how youre getting paid today? Peer Schatz Good question, well the easy one is what is the revenue base that we currently have? Its approximately 4% of our sales base and seeing significant growth. The growth is really across all customer classes, very strong base in the research areas, clearly through the legacy products, ITA, also Ingenuity Variant Analysis or the CLC workbenches but were seeing strong adoption and in the mean time the clinical markets and that is driving a lot of the growth and actually across our customer classes but in particular our clinical will be15 strong growth contribution. Its very difficult to assess that we have everything we need in such as dynamic and fast moving environment. But if we look at what were out to do is to create solutions that allow our customers to create valuable insights from complex molecular data, not only with the wet lab but also with the so-called dry lab or bioinformatics solutions. We have a very, very strong pipe already that we can put on to a wet lab solutions to create exactly that experience. So, if we take a very focused or narrowly focused view, yes we have everything underway for what we need now in the near term but as its obviously dynamic market with new potentials emerging and we are settling these opportunities as part of our overall strategy. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Jack Meehan I just wanted to get any commentary on the HPV market internationally and just your outlook there, sort of the opportunities for greater penetration versus how the competitive environment looks and any changes there? Peer Schatz Thanks. Its almost there is -- there are like two heads of the HPV story, one is the story in the Unites States; the other story is against all expectations and I think against everything that you normally would expect. The incumbent product, namely our product, is a very strong market leading solution with a majority of the market and has transitioned this now into a new pricing level which is fairly lower than -- substantially lower than what we saw a few years ago. And its a story very different ex-U.S. We are hands down beating competition in almost every large screening program because were -- if you look at competing products, the specification, the headline specifications just dont live up to the requirements of a primary screening campaign in large populations. And were in the meantime undertaking several national screening programs that we have really announced this. And frankly because there is a lot of emotion around this whole portfolio in the United States, weve refrained from creating a lot of announcements about actually tremendous success that were having outside the U.S. winning and implementing national screening campaigns in very sizable countries where were talking about millions of women being screened. So, this is a continued long and bright future that we have with this portfolio. And were continuing to invest in it. As the leader, we also see the responsibility to do that. Story in the United States will start stabilizing later this year. We have therefore I think an interesting situation next year where were going to be talking about growth rates in HPV and not HPV headwinds that were due to some irrational behaviors in the market. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citigroup. Please go ahead. Dan Arias Peer, on the liquid biopsy portfolio or business, is it your impression that there is basically a large group of companies that are putting together strategies here for liquid biopsy diagnostics or is it at this point are really the big cancer players that are pushing hard here. And maybe as a follow-up to the bioinformatics discussion and as it relates to BGI, is BGI looking to incorporate Ingenuity Clinical or is it pretty much fairly into the research projects at this point? Peer Schatz So, the first question on liquid biopsy, there are pillars of our strategy. The one pillar is that were enabling almost every player in the market with liquid biopsy solutions on the front end. So every time you read about liquid biopsies being used in novel tests and new companies emerging using this new approach to create new types of tests, you will almost always see our sample technologies either the manual solutions on QIAamp, on QIAcube or also now on QIASymphony being used on the front end. They are pretty much ubiquitous. Our market shares on the front and are staggering. And thats something that were investing in heavily actually and you see also the breadth of solutions we have in the meantime. There is no other company that can easily jump between exosomes and circulating tumor cells and cell-free DNA, because the battle is not which of the three is better but the ultimate value proposition is where can we create most value per patient and that often depends. And the ability to move to different sample technologies or introduce different approaches continues to be very valuable by our customers. Thats a one strategy, absolute leadership and sample technologies for liquid biopsy. The second strategy is that were selectively integrating that into horizontal workload combining with some of our tests as well and benefiting just like were enabling other customers as well benefitting from this new approach for our own tests. And this includes existing tests like the EGFR portfolio; there are many others that were using in the meantime. They include for instance the compatibility of our next generation sequencing panels are liquid biopsy ready. This is unique. And while others fiddle around with different region combinations and different workflow combinations, weve immediately created compatibilities for both FFPE, primary sample type and liquid biopsy solutions for our GeneReader workflows. And we see a tremendous amount of momentum in this market. I think it will take some time to make sure that we are creating the right performance specifications in this market to really replace some of the existing assays or some of the new promises because early diagnostics very often look good and that proof is in the pudding and extensive validations. And this will be very, very important because were talking about diseases that are in many cases life threatening. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird GmbH. Please go ahead.  Jeff Elliott First one here is on the QIAsymphony. In light of all the assays youve been adding to that over the past couple of years, can you give us an update on where the installed base is at in terms of the mix between molecular diagnostics and applied customers and what they have reported right now on that platform? Peer Schatz Its interesting to hear that Baird just turned into a GmbH; are you inverted into Germany? The QIASymphony portfolio is about two-thirds clinical and a third life sciences. The majority of the life science placements are however in the area of the applied testing, in particular forensic. We have some very interesting solutions for forensic customers. So, almost all from our industrial. Were increasingly seeing a strong uptake in next generation sequencing labs because the QIAsymphony has unique capabilities to do high molecular weight, nucleic acid purifications which is very difficult to do and we have some unique protocols that are in the QIASymphony reflected that purpose. In addition, we have the ability to run also the liquidity biopsy technologies on the platform as well. So, the breadth and the quality of the sample types is very amenable to next generation sequencing and were seeing good uptake there as well. And that is both clinical and life science, but again the majority clinical, two-thirds clinical and the third lifeline, majority of that applied. The menu breadth in Europe is very significant and we are continually upgrading it. We had a big upgrade last year in hospital-acquired infections, have the full menu there actually, some very novel tests that are not available from any other player in this market, and have seen very good traction there are well. In the United States, the menu remains very limited. Well continue to put menu onto the platform, but were more integrating select FDA approved product with broader use in laboratory developed testing where the breadth and the flexibility of the platform is unrivaled and this is giving us good traction in the U.S. And if you look at the placements, there are actually significant approaching 50/50 I guess U.S. and rest of the world and this trend will probably continue that way. The pull-through is something that depends very much on the market. Were seeing very strong growth in consumable and asset pull-through, very high double digit growth in this space. But on the overall franchise, pull-through is still south of 100,000 which considering that there is a big LDT base, its actually very good. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. Dan Leonard So Peer, just hoping you could offer some color on what youre seeing in the pharma market. That was the slowest growth of your customer class this quarter, but it seems like many of your peers are talking of pharma as a source of strength, so hoping you could help me reconcile. Peer Schatz Yes, its a good question and to understand that the first part of the answer will be that there are different parts of supplies into pharma, so one is for instance in the area of production and quality control. Were starting to see good ramp up of biologics and also therefore good expansion of the use of these tools. And this is an area that we have some exposure to but not really a lot. Our primary exposure is into the early stage research and/or preclinical research and the other half is in the areas of clinical research. And clinical research is continuing to do very well. Were seeing good growth rate. The preclinical is very, very compressed due to cost saving measures and so that trend that started almost 10 years ago, that is just continuing. In addition, were seeing some lumpiness. There are quarters where you have a big clinical trial and then you have big orders coming through and then that can impact the quarter $1 million or $2 million in sales, from that percentage of revenue will have a big impact. Were very committed to this because of the porosity into the clinical world especially through the companion diagnostics franchise. Its sometime difficult for us to allocate between these two areas, but the expectation is that were going to see lower to mid single digit growth in the pharma market probably over the as a long-term trend. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead. Doug Schenkel I have three, let me just rattle through them real quick. First, I believe you previously guided us to expect 60 basis points to 70 basis points of operating margin expansion for the full year, net of 30 basis points to 40 basis points of FX. I believe guidance is now for 50 basis points of operating margin expansion for the year. In your prepared remarks, you indicated there will be no incremental impact of FX on margin, if I have all these observations accurate, whats the change here? Thats the first question. The second question is, on the last quarterly call you indicated that FX would reduce EPS by I think it was about $0.05 to $0.07 on a reported basis for the full year. Based on current rates would the impact on EPS now be about $0.10 to $0.12 on a reported basis? And my third question is constant currency consumables growth was about 2%. As we try to assess the puts and takes, can you breakout what the growth rate was for bioinformatics and M&A. Im just trying to get at organic consumables growth excluding HPV, M&A and bioinformatics. Peer Schatz Let me try the first one and I guess background took my brain and I will do the third one at the same time. On profitability I think at the end of day nothing really has changed if it comes to operating margins, if you look at the final outcome what -- I think what we said earlier this year is of course it is a hard to predict where currency is going to go and therefore we strongly speak to our constant exchange rate guidance in terms of revenue as well as in terms of EPS and what we did is giving all this indication for the next quarter. Having all said, what weve seen on the first quarter at the end of day that on the one hand-side, we actually got some field in terms of impact on our margins and that was mainly driven by the relationship between euro and U.S. dollars on the one hand side as we do have a cost overhang in euro that is actually beneficial for us. At the same time, what we have seen which is clearly a quite significant change for us as well as is that currency relationship between U.S. dollar and Swiss francs [ph] improved which is also important one for us. So that was the reason how we ended on our Q1 results. If you would take now the April currency rates, actual currency rates of April as a given for all through rest of 2015, we do believe that we will have an actual rate probably at 50 basis points improvement for the full year 2015. And therefore I think were in line and what we said also on our mid and long-term guidance. Again we are right now running on full speed and that is driven by couple of this significant launches, Peer described before. On the EPS side, things are even I would say have improved for us compared to what we have seen and said during our January call and guidance. Because what we said today is that we have seen on $0.02 EPS impact for the first quarter on currency and we expect around 0.02 EPS impact for the second quarter. But of course if you look on the currencies and how they move in 2014 and fourth quarter this impact is going to diminish in a larger way. So, the overall impact is probably coming down quite a bit. And again I dont want to get too precisely because nobody knows exactly how currencies are moving. But again using April base, you probably have some around $0.02 for the second six months of 2015 in currency impact. So then on the one hand side if you look at our guidance is somewhere between $1.16 to $1.18 EPS for 2015 on current exchange rate. And Ive given you right now lets say around $0.06 or $0.07 EPS that is clearly better than quantum right now as I see the list. The third question was on the revenue growth rate. As we said on the script at the end of the day, we have an overall growth rate of 2.3% for the quarter and at the end of the day, we had a contribution from the acquisitions of around on 2% as well. Nevertheless it includes of course HPV franchise, so, ex-HPV organic growth rate was around 6% and growing over the course of 2015, we do expect that its going to be incrementally to improve. Bioinformatics has a solid growth rate so far as Peer indicated before and with now being [indiscernible] so we feel quite strongly about that as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of William Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. William Quirk Two questions. First one is giving the experience that QIAGEN has in diagnostics and certainly in sample prep, where do you see the greatest uptake in the near-term for liquid biopsy and then what applications do you think will take longer to develop? Peer Schatz Its something were thinking a lot about because there are lot of applications that look kind of interesting but will probably require a lot of validation. And as you well know, there has been  very often take a lot of money and a lot of the time and ultimately not lead to the results that we all expect. We see the market currently by far dominated by prenatal testing. This is the earliest form of high volume liquid biopsy testing that emerged. And that will -- its clearly a growth driver and will continue to be a growth driver for many years. And that will probably be the largest in terms of volume for quite some time. The next set is emerging as -- are not these very complicated fancy new tests but are actually existing tests that have been well validated in controlled clinical trials using primary tissue. And where we can then do a side by side like we did with the ASSESS study with AstraZeneca, where you basically have the tumor and the liquid biopsy sample running parallel and can do concordance studies. That is going to be much strong. I think that is underestimated in the public thats actually where there is a bigger trend right now. And the third area Id say these very complex new tests that are emerging for indications that previously were not testable, only very difficult to do. That is going to take some time to validate and become high volume routine tests over time. So commercially thus far the largest existing test in prenatal moving into liquid biopsy. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Wendorff of Commerzbank. Please go ahead. Daniel Wendorff One follow-up question on the liquid biopsy test development. Can you comment on how many developments like percentage-wise which I assume is the broad indication in oncology and what other indications are being pursued? And second question on the QuantiFERON-TB test, on the back of what youve said in the call, would you be comfortable to achieve a more than 20% growth for this test in sales in 2015 again? Peer Schatz The first question is follow-on to what we just talked about before with Bill is again the majority is currently prenatal testing and the various types of tests are emerging out of that and the secondary are the existing tests, very often single marker test but also next-gen sequencing panels in the meantime. And the newer tests will take some time to emerge. So oncology is by the most that were seeing right now but were also starting to see some other indications emerge but its -- the majority is oncology. The QuantiFERON franchise, the revenue base that we have today its over $100 million, its continuing to grow very rapidly into the market with new products are coming. We wouldnt going to put any expectations on prior growth rate but the market is vast. And this is not a market that will suddenly snowball and start accelerating in growth rates. As routine with other similar tests in the past, you will probably see a trajectory, a long-term sustainable trajectory of penetration into the market. Over 50 million skin tests being done a year. The market is just expanded with higher prevalence countries now certainly become economically and clinically very viable areas to implement like TB testing and significantly expands the market size. And with that the growth rates definitely have a lot of support in terms of the environment, the market opportunity to also be able show very strong double-digit growth. I wouldnt want to put out a number right now, were going to do that every year but the long-term trajectory is definitely -- I wouldnt expect this to suddenly decelerate or suddenly accelerate, but very much continue like this.
