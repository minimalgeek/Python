All lines have been placed in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect. I would now like to turn the call over to Ben Bier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co. Thank you, and good morning. With me today are Tim Wentworth, CEO and President, and Eric Slusser, EVP and CFO. Before we begin, I need to read the following safe harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in the company's most-recent form 10K and form 10Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update or otherwise release publically any revisions to our forward-looking statements. For clarity purposes, all financial numbers, except where indicated, that we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis and are attributable to Express Scripts excluding non-controlling interest representing the share allocated to members of our consolidated affiliates. This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with the footnotes and the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com. At this point, I will turn the call over to Tim. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Thank you, Ben and good morning everyone. This morning, I want to address our recent disclosure related to Anthem. We will discuss the contribution that Anthem along with our transitioning clients, namely Coventry and Catamaran, have on our business and how the core PBM is performing excluding them. We'll also discuss why we are excited about the outlook for our core PBM and how we are well-positioned to achieve strong results as a focused, independent PBM in 2017 and well beyond. Our discussion will also include an update on 2017 selling season. Then Eric will review our financial results for the first quarter and updated 2017 full-year outlook. As you saw in our release yesterday, Anthem recently told us that they intended to move their business when our contract with them expires at the end of 2019. Although we are under no obligation to do so, we disclosed the financial contribution of the Anthem business to Express Scripts. We did so voluntarily to bring greater visibility to our core business and remove uncertainty that has existed about Anthem's business. As we have stated and is now clearly evidence, we do not have $3 billion in savings to give Anthem from pricing concessions alone. This is the point we've made since the figure was first stated by Anthem in January of 2016, at a time when we actually had earned less than $2 billion on Anthem's business the prior year. Though Anthem has made continuous demands for price concessions, they ignore completely the $4.7 billion of value they received in 2009 when Express Scripts purchased Anthem's then government-sanctioned PBM, NextRX. They also ignore the unique which accompanied it Despite Express Scripts recommendation in 2009 to enter into a more traditional pricing arrangement with less up front dollars, Anthem's management at the time elected to take and use these funds to buy back shares instead of accepting more competitive pricing and contract terms. The decision to accept the pricing and contract terms they currently have, and the $4.7 billion up-front payment was their choice, and we believe it is worth mentioning that at the time, Anthem publically stated that their pharmacy costs were going down as a result of entering into the 10-year agreement with Express Scripts. Now, with each passing day, Anthem is foregoing additional price concessions of as much as $1 billion annually that we are willing to provide. And as it should be clear today the annual rate relief of $3 billion which they have been so adamant to receive simply isn't something we can offer. That said, we are the only PBM that can provide Anthem with pharmacy savings between now and 2020. We are also the only solution that avoids the need to transition Anthem's clients and members to an in-house PBM or another PBM, a significant undertaking, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and creating unnecessary risk and some level of disruption for patients and clients. As some of you may know, it took three years to bring Anthem's business on to Express Scripts platform starting in 2009. With or without Anthem, our strategy, independent business model, and unique solutions collectively position us for a strong future. Our national preferred formulary, the nation's largest with 25 million members, none of whom are from Anthem, give us unrivalled supply chain leverage. Excluding Anthem, our diverse client base represents over 65 million members, and we will have a volume of more than 1 billion prescriptions annually. Over the next two and a half years or longer, while we continue to serve Anthem and its members, we will focus on using the value that we are willing to give them to thoughtfully position our core business for the future. As you saw in our earnings press release, we've elected to provide information as to the financial performance of our business with and without Anthem and the other transitioning clients in order to demonstrate that the company's core PBM business excluding Anthem is well-positioned for future growth. In 2016, the core PBM business processed nearly 1.2 billion adjusted claims, representing growth of 2.2% excluding Anthem and our transitioning clients, and earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA representing growth of 6.2% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. Our core PBM growth in 2016 was largely attributable to the rapid adoption of our SafeGuardRX suite of solutions, patent expirations on several drugs with significant branded revenue, a renegotiated agreement with Walgreens and lower SG&A spending. As you may recall, in 2016, we reduced our clients' drug trend from 5.2% to 3.8%, or 27%, saving clients billions of dollars. Our 2016 core results clearly demonstrate that in years when we have the opportunity to create competition to drive down costs and ensure patient access, we also benefit, highlighting the power of our model of alignment. In addition to the growth in our core PBM, a large portion of the reduction in EBITDA from our transitioning clients was offset by growth in EBITDA attributable to Anthem business. Anthem's EBITDA growth in 2016 was largely driven by the addition of Amerigroup lives onto the ESI platform and incremental volume from their healthcare exchange business. Notably, the $1.9 billion in EBITDA attributable to Anthem is obviously quite a bit lower than the $3 billion figure they publically claimed in January 2016 that they should be paid. Eric will provide more detail on the company's consolidated results in a few moments, but I want to highlight that based on our prior guidance, we're targeting consolidated Express Scripts EBITDA growth of 1% to 3% in 2017. Turning to the longer-term, our independent model uniquely positions us to grow our core business over the long-term. Our flexibility, agility and laser focus on pharmacy makes us the only PBM fully aligned with our clients' best interests as we protect them against the impact of skyrocketing drug prices. When you look at the dynamics in the health care market, over the next five to 10 years, our role will be more important than ever. Our market-leading assets, relentless innovation, and unique alignment with clients make us an attractive option for payers who truly want to change the dynamics of medicine affordability and access. Our unmatched expertise and focus on supply chain management, specialty pharmacy and member experience, particularly in the 90-day retail and mail channels, will drive to lower unit cost at a time when payers need solutions more than ever. In specialty in particular, we not only rein in costs, but greatly improve care, making sure that every patient gets the most out of their medicine. Our Accredo specialized care model sets us apart and puts us well ahead of our competition. And beyond specialty, for those patients who may be challenged because they are uninsured, underinsured or in high deductible health plans, we have new solutions coming soon to address those specific needs and will generate value beyond what is already available. The future holds significant new opportunities for all of our levers to drive solid growth. For example, we believe there will be a more active FDA which will approve more medicines and generate greater competition in the marketplace and no one leverages competition better than we do. Beyond unit cost management, our focused clinical tools, including our TRC powered SafeGuardRx suite of solutions, position us to create value-based opportunities to deliver great value to patients and clients. We can generate additional value as new drugs are approved, as biosimilars come to market, and as manufacturers increasingly step-up to deliver value beyond purchase price reduction. As I have said before, we are bringing value-based care to life and we will continue to drive this trend. In fact, just last week on CNBC, the head of PhRMA pointed to working with PBMs as the way his members were looking to bring value-based arrangements to the marketplace. I couldn't agree more. Finally, a strong core is built not just on creating and making the most of external opportunities but also by managing internal costs and investments to ensure a highly efficient lean approach. We have proven over the years that we can do this. It is a hallmark of Express Scripts. We have several significant initiatives underway to increase efficiency, further reduce our cost base and generate more opportunities to invest in further automation and technology solutions. Areas which will transform our company and what we offer to patients and our clients. As I noted earlier, our SafeGuardRx solutions, along with our broader TRC-powered clinical toolset, help patients and clients manage pharmacy with a focus on optimal health outcomes at the lowest possible cost. While 2016 was a banner year for launching these programs and enrolling our clients in these powerful solutions, we continue to evolve them and add additional approaches this year and going forward. These solutions not only drive outcomes – look no further, frankly, than our drug trend results for that – but create significant reason for clients to stay with us and prospects to consider us. As I look out at the landscape, it is clear our patients, clients and prospects need a partner who is relentlessly focused on health outcomes and cost containment. Our innovation will serve to protect them against tomorrow's health care challenges and create opportunities for them to benefit as the market evolves. In that context, we are very pleased with our client retention thus far during the selling and renewal season. While it is still somewhat early, we anticipate another strong year, with a 2018 retention rate of 95% to 98% of Coventry scripts that are rolling off due to acquisition. Our renewals are balanced across both our health plan and commercial books. Now from a selling perspective, this is a somewhat lighter than average year due to a number of meaningful opportunities being pushed into 2019, given the uncertainty of health care reform. However, we are actively engaged with prospects who are interested in the strength of our innovative aligned model. I will now turn it over to Eric to discuss our first quarter 2017 results. Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Yesterday, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33, which represents an increase of 9% over last year. Our adjusted claims for the quarter were $351.7 million, above the midpoint of our guidance range. We also generated $1.5 billion of EBITDA, resulting in EBITDA per adjusted claim of $4.25, up 4% from the prior year. In the first quarter, there were also approximately $24 million of one-time items that impacted our adjusted SG&A expense, primarily attributable to severance and legal fees. Excluding the impact from Anthem and our transitioning clients, our core PBM EBITDA grew 50 basis points in the first quarter. We expect growth in our core PBM to ramp up in the remainder of the year as we realize higher utilization of our SafeGuardRx programs throughout the year, and increased penetration of generics in our book of business, as well as the timing of supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design and reinsurance payments from the government. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion of net cash flow from operations. We also repurchased 13.3 million shares for approximately $900 million during the quarter. Share repurchases were made through a combination of open market purchases and a 10b5-1 plan. Now let's turn to 2017. We continue to expect 2017 adjusted claims to come in at the midpoint of $1.4 billion, generating an expected EBITDA in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion, up 2% at the midpoint over 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.82 to $7.02, to $6.90 to $7.04, representing growth of 8% to 10% at the midpoint of the range. The increase in guidance is attributed to our focus on tax planning strategies and the management of our capital structure. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 575 million to 595 million. Our diluted share range reflects that our 10b-5 plan will end in July. With respect to the second quarter of 2017, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.74, up 8% to 11% year-over-year. Consistent with recent years, we expect to receive certain revenues related to the structure of our Anthem contract to be realized in the second quarter. We expect this amount to be approximately 50% less than the 2016 payment of approximately $107 million. Finally, I want to touch on how we're focusing on our long-term financial framework. Although we're not prepared to provide specific long-term adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance, based on internal assumptions regarding healthcare trends, industry positioning, and the overall environment, we are excited about the future of our core PBM. For the period from 2017 through 2020, we're targeting a compounded annual EBITDA growth rate of 2% to 4% for the core PBM. In addition, this earnings growth should continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. Aside from gradually paying down debt, our capital deployment strategies remain the same, funding internal growth, making strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to our shareholders. To achieve our targeted leverage targets, we anticipate we will use approximately 30% of our annual cash flow from operations between now and 2020 for debt reduction. We remain committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade rating. Finally, the healthcare landscape is fraught with inefficiencies, and we continue to search for strategic acquisitions that will enhance our core, as well as provide additional services to payers, patients, and our clients. I'll now turn the call back over to Tim. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Thanks, Eric. Briefly, before we begin Q&A, I simply want to reinforce four important things. First, in 2009, we offered Anthem lower rates, but instead they chose more value upfront. The Anthem truly represents a one-of-a-kind client and contract. Second, Anthem has demanded $3 billion per year in price concessions, and as you have seen today, that type of savings is simply not available. Third, we are the only PBM that can provide rate relief to Anthem before 2020, and then give them market-leading rates post 2020, and we are frankly surprised they are uninterested in capturing that value. Finally, and most importantly, our solutions are in demand, and our work has never been more important. With or without Anthem, we remain well-positioned for future growth and to lead the way to more affordable access to medicine. Thank you. And, operator, we'll now open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Thanks very much, and good morning. Tim, let me start with my first question which would be around client flight risk. In talking to investors last night and this morning, it appears that people are thinking back to when Medco lost some clients, and then you obviously announced you were going to merge with Express Scripts. I viewed that as more of the merger versus the loss of clients, but can you maybe just spend a couple of minutes talking about how you're thinking about potential loss of any client, or any changes in the negotiation with your current client base? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure, Lisa, and good morning. Thanks for the question. So let me start with, our clients understand that the contract we have with Anthem, as I just said, is dramatically different. The up-front money that they demanded in 2009 and the contract that also followed it, specifically the market check language in that contract, which is very different, or the periodic market review language, as it's called in the contract. So our clients understand that. As you can imagine, we haven't just started talking to them about this this year. Anthem has been out for quite a period of time. They filed a lawsuit a year ago now. And we have a strong playbook in terms of how we talk with clients. And I can tell you very quickly, the conversation pivots to, okay, let's talk about what you can do for me in terms of drug trend, in terms of programs, and so forth. I think the Medco situation was very different due to a few things that I won't detail now, but suffice it to say we have a strong relationship with our clients. The feedback I've had, and I've obviously spoken with a few already, has been extraordinarily supportive. And you know, quite frankly, if Anthem isn't interested in receiving $3 billion over the next three years that would be tremendously valuable to them, we're going to invest that as well into the core of this business and drive our solutions even further and faster. And I think our clients are going to benefit directly from that, and that's what I'm sharing with them. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan And then if I can just, maybe just a couple points of clarification here. When we talk about the EBITDA attributable to Anthem, I just want to make sure that we understand that EBITDA is all-inclusive of all the benefit that you're getting around – for example, I know they're not on your national formulary, but you're probably purchasing on their behalf or negotiating on their behalf, right? And so there's probably some benefit within the EBITDA there. And so as we think about that, number one, I'd want to confirm that. And then secondly, how do we think about the run-rate over the next couple of years? There was a nice jump from 2015 to 2016, and I think that was, again, due to the incremental contracting of what you're doing out in the marketplace around pharmaceutical costs. But I just want to understand those two factors; all-inclusive on the EBITDA line, and then secondly, as we think about the run-rate over the next couple of years, should we see an incremental step-up in 2017, 2018, 2019? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So let me start, and I'll let Eric add any color. First of all, let me say this as simply as I know how to. If Anthem were to leave today, the EBITDA that we've showed you – we would have work to do, first of all, obviously, which is the work we're doing, as I talked about, costs. But we would not see the EBITDA attributable to the core decrease because of some lost leverage that we would be gaining by virtue today, by virtue of having Anthem. Let me say it a different way, and you kind of said it. They don't participate in our national preferred formulary. We will have 25 million members who we take to the table when we negotiate with pharma. Not one of those is an Anthem member. That will continue. So they've gone, you know, we've supported them, they've gained our scale and our ability to contract at scale. They've gained from that, but I can tell you from the broad book of business, that's not the case. And so our EBITDA on the core is very much what you would expect going forward. As it relates to – and by the way, the other piece is obviously in our mail service and GPO leverage, Anthem is not particularly high mail, and our ability to negotiate with generic manufacturers, remember, we're still at over 1.2 billion prescriptions overall, we still have a strong mail service franchise and 90-day franchise generally, our ability to negotiate there will not be diminished by virtue of Anthem's 200 million claims. As it relates to the run-rate, what I would just say is, listen, Anthem, as you saw, and I assume you mean the run-rate for Anthem, Anthem has grown. And I would expect over the next three years as they put in programs that we've – they've been working with us to put in programs to drive down pharmacy costs, we benefit when those programs are put in and so do they. So I would expect to and I frankly hope to grow Anthem's profitability and EBITDA over the next three years as we put solutions in and as we continue to use our their behalf, separately from our book of business. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Quickly, do you expect that that's going to grow materially? You're talking about 1% to 3% this year, kind of 2% to 4% on a core run rate basis. When we think about the Anthem business and the 14% growth you saw last year, would you think that that's kind of growth or would you say it's probably going to be more in line with the Express overall growth? I think that from an investment perspective, people are just trying to get an idea of where this will be when you exit the relationship in 2019? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure. I would expect that what you should see is kind of what you've seen with our core, which is it will be more in line with – you know, the EBITDA any given year is a function of, even in this contract, a function of how much opportunity does the supply chain sort of have in terms of creating competition? Whether that's going and renegotiated rebates because new products come out, whether that's putting in programs, whether that's new generics, et cetera. And so, I would anticipate, while we aren't going to give forward-looking guidance on just Anthem, it's probably going to perform similar to what we've said for the core. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Okay, I'll stop there, thank you. Operator Thank you, the next question comes from Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, Tim and Eric, can you speak to the 2% to 4% EBITDA CAGR that you're throwing out there? What are assumptions around new business in terms of a driver of that? And then just secondarily, I think the story is more predicated on you getting the capital deployed productively over the next few years on deals. Can you help us, Tim, I know you've had some kind of high level guidelines for kinds of things that are interesting, but isn't it more critical now to offer a bit more granularity on the kinds of capabilities that might help you fill any Anthem hole that does materialize. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure, so I'll take first – the contribution of new business is, is a component, but I would not say it's the driving component, Robert. As you know, when we win new business, it's typically, you know, less-penetrated than the things that are valuable to us and over a series of years we penetrate it better. Now I will tell you, retention continues to be a key goal of ours, and in making sure we invest in solutions that maintain the value we create for clients. And so – but we also do target winning new business. And we think over the next three years we anticipate that we will add materially to our client base, but I would also tell you that winning at all costs is not only not required, it's not the strategy. And so we intend to compete well in the new sales space. We think our solutions differentiate us meaningfully. We get that feedback from the marketplace. In this selling season we continue to see good response to that, but it's not the core driver. As it relates to deals, you know, listen, I, we're not going to tell you what we're looking at. I can tell you, we're extraordinarily engaged in things. We're going to deploy our cash really carefully though. It's not to say that we will or won't do a deal, it's to say we are going to be really thoughtful about how we invest in ourselves, how we, both through technology, investments and other internal investments, deploy it back to shareholders, and then we do look at M&A. We do like cost containment and payer services sorts of opportunities. We like niche opportunities in areas like worker's compensation and specialty, we are interested in healthcare analytics or medical management. Those are some of the areas that we're looking at out across the broader market as things that will potentially diversify and help our EBIT beyond the core grow. And so we are very, very intentional in those areas. And I think if you were to talk to, you know, pick your fiddler, talk to – pick your favorite three investment bankers, they would tell you that we're – we read everything, but we're engaging very, very meaningfully. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC And just a clarification, Tim, just the magnitude of the pipeline of opportunities. Would it be realist to assume something could get done this year that would be noteworthy, or is it just impossible to predict and it could be year three before we see anything additive? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. You know, I don't want to predict. I don't think you should expect – I'm not going to give you any timelines. As much as we're holding ourselves to doing the right deal. And that timing will then ripen however it manifests itself. I would love to see us make sure that we take good care of our cash. And I'll tell you, depending on where things are at right now, buying our stock back is not going to be a bad use until such time as we find something that's also terribly strategically interesting, not just from a cash perspective. The other thing I'd say, Bob is you know, beyond just deals, I think this core business is built to engage differently with the healthcare supply chain and the – and the health, and the broadly-defined healthcare services piece. And whether you look at what we've done with blank and Lilly, with Mango, with value-based manufacture agreements, with the diabetes program with Walgreens, with what we did for a major health plan in California as it relates to performance-based retail network, etc. etc. We actually see a pipeline of very interesting opportunities there that don't require us to invest billions of dollars, but actually can leverage innovation and our natural core in very unique ways, and you should expect to hear more about that over the next six months to eighteen months as much as anything else around a more traditional deal flow. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Could you speak to your methodology with allocation of fixed and corporate expense relative to the three, I guess three segmentations, but really what I'm interested also is how you arrived at, or whether any intention to drive down the total EBITDA associated with Anthem, and what we will be left with at core Express Scripts? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes, Eric. So as to our allocation methodology, as we presented in the press release, we're showing adjusted EBITDA from the pieces of the business. So included in there below the margin is a portion of the variable costs. And as it relates to Anthem, if and when it goes, we'd expect those costs to ratably come out as the business goes out. We also allocate a portion of fixed costs. I will tell you that's at a level that's less than their revenue. But on a fixed cost basis, we look department by department, person by person. We've had a very, very refined methodology that we've used over time that looks across the organization, and anything that can be specifically identified to a client is done that way. And then from there, we look at various factors including prescriptions, lives and revenue to allocate remaining costs. Now to that basis, as Tim talked about in his prepared remarks, we have always been and will continue to be very, very cost-focused. We have three more years before this contract is up, and we have a mind and an eye to cost reduction between now and then. We know what those fixed costs are that have been allocated, and we know what has to be taken out as we approach 2020. So hopefully, that addresses your question. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. And history would suggest that these type of contracts tend to roll off over multiple years. How do you think about, or what have you seen, in terms of your ability to reduce costs and how that rolls over the one, two, three years that takes to ramp down? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes. So we are – obviously have been planning for this and are very laser-focused on that. As to that roll-off, what we do know is the contract goes through the end of 2019. So the roll-off couldn't begin until after that date. And then that's entirely up to them. But as we have seen, whether it be through our united contracts, through the Coventry, Catamaran, these things typically take years, not a year. So – but we can't predict that, but we will be lined up to take the costs out accordingly, with whatever timing the roll-off is. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. And, Tim, you've always stated a commitment to serving the customer. If they – if Anthem comes to you and says, we want three years as we build it out ourselves. Is there a point at which you turn off the key? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Well – so, I'd start by reminding you that we have a one-year obligation. And after that, quite frankly, it's a negotiable item. And what I would tell you is listen, we're never going to put patients in the middle. We're never going to be in a situation where there's a member who is an Anthem member who can't get what they need. But I can also tell you that, from our perspective, we've got – we're moving on. That's the message you should get today is, we have a strong core. We've been trying for a year to find a way forward here. We still – the door is always open here. I'd be much more open for an extension of this contract that we've been trying to get done at market rates in exchange for some up-front money that nobody else can give them. So, the conversations that we will have as it relates to what happens after 2020 haven't started, and we, quite frankly, will be in a situation where, what we'll have to do is make sure we're taking care of all the rest of our long-term clients, while at the same time not putting their patients in the middle. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you for that. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Dave MacDonald of SunTrust. Your line is open. David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Guys, look, I just have one question left. I was wondering, Tim, can you provide just a bit more detail? You talk a little bit about exception pricing, how often this happens, how key you think that is to helping them win. And when you guys have these – have had these conversations about trying to renew the contract, how often does a topic like that come up? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. It's – over the years, it's come up a lot. I mean, and it's come up in different ways. As you would recall in the beginning of this contract, you may recall, Anthem underperformed wickedly the script volume that was initially built into the business. It was one of the risks, frankly, that George and the team at the time were taking, was on volume. And so, from our standpoint, we've worked hard over the years to help them grow by giving them exception pricing on something like 400 individual accounts, mostly on larger national accounts, as you can appreciate, which was not contractually obligated, but we felt it was the right thing to do. We would clearly benefit, and they would clearly benefit from being able to win and grow their national account business. In addition, when they bought Amerigroup, we constantly updated their pricing on the Medicaid business, and that's why they moved Amerigroup's lives to us early. That was not contractually required, but we thought it was important to do. We've helped them on Medicare Part D, not only operationally, getting them off sanctions, but also actually in continuing to improve their rates there. And so – and it's all been just, you know, listen, we are aligned to grow Anthem. We're aligned to grow them, you know, we've been aligned to grow them since 2009. And so, we have been very strategic about working with them to help them win in various marketplaces. And so, as we look forward obviously, you know, the exception pricing process is not contractually required, and it's something that will probably be less critical in the future, but it has been something that we've worked very well with them on, leading up to now. David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Garen Sarafian of Citi Research. Your line is open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good morning, Tim and Eric. So first, a follow-up on a prior question regarding the long-term EBITDA growth, 2% to 4%. So you mentioned there's a little bit of a contribution from new client wins, but not much. So, could you just break it down a little bit more? If volume is growing, the data that we're seeing is maybe 1% to 2%, and there's a little bit of new client wins baked into that 2% to 4%. So wondering, just how you guys are thinking about it? If you can give a little bit more clarity. And sort of what the margin is on a per-script basis with no additions? Are you assuming it to be flat? Even down? Up? If you can offer more? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So I'll give you a – my first crack at it. If we didn't grow volume at all, to us, and if I look at the – let's take the 2% to 4% range that we gave you, and just dissect that sort of at a macro level. If we get a headwind on volume, whether that's new wins or utilization, we see that as plus or minus a half a basis point in that overall – 50 basis points, rather – in that sort of total 2% to 4% equation. You probably have a couple of percent of growth that sits in our product programs, our management of pricing effectively, so that can be a negative, but that's factored in there. When we look at supply chain management and the opportunities when we look out, and as you can imagine, we aren't just projecting sort of blindly here. We underwrite every day and take risk three years out. And so, we looked at that as we looked at the contribution existing clients over the next three years would have. We look at inflation, both brand and generic inflation, and factor that in. Again, when you take all of that, the product program, supply chain management, inflation, that has the potential to contribute, I would say, at least 1% to 2% EBITDA growth a year, on average, CAGR. From a standpoint of then, you've got specialty which, independent from that, we see specialty being a significant growth driver for us. We're having very great success on the pharma side getting access to limited medications. And then obviously, we've won several of the larger independent freestanding specialty bids that were out there over the last year or so. So we're competing well in specialty. And then finally expenses, which again, can be half a point to a point for us in terms of this. So, when you break it all down, and I'm not going to get more discrete than that, because obviously the world gives us opportunities that we can't even envision sitting here, and our job is to take advantage of them and drive client savings and keep a little bit for ourselves. But that's generally broadly the way to think about it. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. No, fair enough. And then, you mentioned here in this response now, as well as Eric in, I think, the prepared responses, regarding supply chain initiatives in the back-half of the year. So sort of piggybacking on that, last year, you used up your last extension of the contract you have with your current distributor. So maybe last year could have been due to uncertainty with where you were going to be with Anthem. So, given yesterday and today's news, how does your current assumption of Anthem influence your procurement strategy, both near term for this year, the back half of the year what's going on other than just the renewal and also just longer term? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. It really doesn't change it materially. I mean our job is to make sure that we have a relationship with our distributor that is both from a unit cost standpoint and a strategy standpoint well aligned with our growth of our core in the future. Anthem, quite frankly, again, they're – they obviously are a significant part of our EBITDA, as we've shown you. As a percentage of our claims that we manage though, and as a percentage of mail specifically, they're actually much lower percentage than they are of the EBITDA. And so I believe if you were to ask our current distributor, they would say they very much want to retain our business and be a strategic partner to us. And we will end the process this year with a strategic partner that is delivering real value to us. And I can tell you, ABC has done a great job for us, and my preference is to make sure that what we do for the next three years works as well as the last three years, whether that's with ABC or anybody else. And I can tell you that again, that's a process we're going through. And we'll – probably we or they will have more to report out to you shortly. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is open. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks very much. Tim, looking beyond Anthem, can you remind us what your rough client mix would be across the book of business? And how do you feel about that? Do you view it as balanced or you think there's work to do there? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. If you take Anthem out, we have a really nicely-balanced book. I would tell you that taking care of our – particularly – if you look at health plans, because obviously Anthem's a large health plan – and they're in multiple lines of business, we're really, really pleased with the relationship we have with major regional players who need what we do at scale. And so our health plan book to business, both the big national or the big blues names that you would recognize as well as other regional players or niche players that play in just one particular line, whether that's Medicaid or Medicare, is a very strong book of business that are trying to compete with the big national players and need a partner like us. From an employer standpoint, that's sort of a legacy book for us and we're pleased with it. We think some of the dynamics in the United States today lend themselves to tighter labor markets, and therefore employers looking to continue to have terrific employment conditions, including benefits for their folks, but do it affordably. And so we think that, that strong book is good. And then the middle market continues to be – what defines the middle market anymore for us, and what it would be self-insured in that market continues to grow as the costs have grown. And we have a unique set of solutions for that marketplace as well that again, that book is a strong book that we continue to grow very nicely. So I really – if I look across the piece, I think that we have a terrific blended book of business. Obviously, the – if you look at the DoD and the federal part, we're very proud of not only our footprint with the DoD but a number of other federal clients. And we see opportunities to grow that book fairly significantly over the next two to three years. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. And one last thing. You mentioned value-based pricing a few times. Can you just expand a bit on what your strategy is? How broadly is that being adopted by your clients? And do you see it continuing to be sort of indication-specific, or do you see maybe an opportunity to broaden it out across, perhaps, a full population utilization? Thanks. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So I'll start, and I'm actually going to – I've got Dr. Steve Miller here who can expand a little bit more on the – sort of how what we're thinking about it in the future. What I would say is this: our enrollment in these programs is amazing. Steve stood up at our Outcomes conference just a couple of years ago and basically asked the crowd, is there anybody that's going to stand with us if we approach some manufacturers in oncology for some value-based arrangements in a couple of places? And hundreds of clients immediately texted their support because they didn't have any partner that was able to do this for them. Their health plans were struggling with this. And we stepped forward. And now when you look at these programs, we have enrollment and inflation protection, for example, of almost 30 million lives. But if you get into the cardiovascular and others, there are over 20 million lives. The newer ones are anywhere from 6 million to 15 million lives. And so – and we've got several more in the chamber as well. So we see this as a long-term chassis to continue to not only innovate but also to optimize over time. And so if you look at cardiovascular, which started with the PCSK9 launch, we've now been able to evolve that program as the PCSK9s have expanded their indications to make sure that we provide patient access where it appropriate but also make sure that we do the management of those patients, and then the cost management in the class. But looking forward, we think that is a tremendous chassis. And, Steve, I'll let you provide any additional color to the question. Steven B. Miller - Express Scripts Holding Co. Only briefly add a couple comments, and that is this has been incredibly popular. When we introduced it to the marketplace, very few people could do it. To this day, very few companies can actually do it. They talk about doing value-based contracting. We've actually been in the business for several years. As Tim already mentioned, we have over 20 million patients participating every day in our SafeGuardRx programs. Those programs continue to expand. Glen Stettin in the product area and others continue to add new modules to it. In the coming year, you're going to see additional modules in multiple sclerosis, in respiratory diseases, two huge categories. And so we think the popularity of this will continue to grow. And when you look at our Drug Trend Report, you can actually see the real impact it's having on employers' expenses. So we're very excited about this area. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Yes. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, just want to go back to some of your comments around Anthem here. The way you kind of make it sound is that you're still open to dialogue here. Can you give a sense – but from what you're hearing from Anthem, would you say that this is sort of a closed-and-done decision? Or do you think there's still room for further discussion? And secondly, how often is it that a client doesn't give an incumbent a look at the RFP? Thanks. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure. When you're servicing a client as well – I'll answer the second part of your question – when you're servicing a client as well as we're servicing Anthem, it's unheard of to not have the chance to renew the client, quite frankly. Even when they go out and look at the market, which they're – which they do. So from that standpoint, to me it's very unusual. But this is an unusual contract, so I started my remarks with that. What I would say is – I don't want to be glib and say go ask Anthem, because I have to take their statements at face value. I mean, obviously, this decision to disclose not only what we make on Anthem but gives you visibility to the core, was not taken lightly. It was taken in the context of a number of conversations that have occurred over the last 90 days, and the last conversation being one where it was very clear that – the last conversation where they reached out to us where it was very clear that they said they were moving on. So let me be clear about that. So I have to take that at face value. Do I hope – are we going to continue to service their members? Yes. Do I hope that we are – ultimately that they rethink their – at least what they told us? Absolutely. I mean we represent the best choice for them. I frankly cannot imagine how their shareholders can withstand not looking at $3 billion worth of value that nobody else can give them. And I just don't understand it, and so we remain absolutely committed to serving them, serving their patients. And my door is always going to be open and my phone will always be in my pocket, hoping that I get that call. But you know what? As of this day, it was our responsibility to provide this visibility. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That's helpful and thanks. And then you talked about – you've talked earlier here about the long-term growth, and you talked about 2% to 4% on EBITDA here. When we think down then to EPS, can you give us any sense on where you think sort of the long-term earnings power is here, obviously, with deploying capital, et cetera? Do you think we can maintain sort of a – at least a double-digit earnings growth trajectory? Thanks. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes. Obviously, we aren't giving you EPS guidance today. But I can – anyone that knows me or knows our board knows that we're very aligned on setting and achieving high targets. And we – listen, it's obvious. You can model it out. Over the next three years, we're going to produce a tremendous amount of cash which we will deploy very thoughtfully. And from where I'm sitting, I'll leave it to you to model. But we would be targeting something that is in the double digits. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the first one, can you help us frame the opportunity to achieve cost savings into context of the Anthem contract? So how should we think about SG&A cost associated with it? What percent of total company SG&A are you allocating? I mean should we assume SG&A's allocated equally across all your customers, or is the SG&A spend towards the Anthem contract is lower because they don't use mail, or they don't use your national formulary as much? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So, Ricky, I'm going to let Eric answer, but I want to actually remind everyone, because I recognize cost allocation is pretty important to us. We've got the DoD as a client, and they have a very detailed requirement around cost accounting that we have implemented a number of years ago. It was right when I joined here that we actually kind of took that to the next level. So I'll let Eric actually answer your question, but I think it's important to note that we have a great team in our finance group here and our legal group that's spent untold hours making sure that we've thoughtfully allocated our cost as best as possible so that what we gave you was a reliable set of numbers that we could then begin quarter-to-quarter to share with you. But in terms of your specific question, I'll turn it over to Eric to talk about the specific kind of proportionality. Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes, and so we're not going to get into the exact percentage. As Tim mentioned, and I mentioned before, this is a very sophisticated process we go through. Nothing was changed. It's been reviewed, and again, as Tim mentioned, when you have government clients, anybody that has ever contracted with them, you know what you have to go through in cost allocation. So all of that has been reviewed in the past. I will tell you that their allocation per RX is slightly under our core allocation. And then as it comes to cost reduction, we have various programs that we have begun to look at our costs over the next three years with a mind of reducing SG&A. We will keep you updated as we progress throughout the year. We're not yet ready to roll-out exactly what our commitments are going to be, but as we progress, it is our intent to do that. So again, very, very cost-focused. Focused on theirs, and again, with the mind-set when we get out to 2020 and 2021, subject to what happens, we know we have some fixed cost absorption that we have to be prepared to absorb. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And then, Tim, the health plan business obviously is an important strategic business for you. Recently you highlighted also that Part D is an important growth area for Express. If you do end up losing Anthem, how do you rebuild your managed care presence and your commitment to growing that Part D business? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure. Well we start with the fact that, again, as I said, we've got a terrific group of clients beyond Anthem, and we've been focused on helping the m grow in their markets. And they would expect to continue to see us do that, and we will double-down on helping those clients grow in their markets. That's the most important thing. But secondly, listen, there are a number of large and fairly large health plans that need first-class PBM services. Not going to speculate how things are going to shake out over the next couple of years, but we see a number of opportunities to be a valued partner for national or regional health plans, either as a full-service PBM or again, we have seen great success in being able to sell to the marketplace key aspects of our overall scale to help them then achieve their objectives. And so I think what you would expect is that over time we're going to be looking at all of those opportunities. I mean, our Blues plans, we've got decades of experience with some of our Blues plans and we have built an entire organization around understanding their brand, enhancing their brand, helping them build their brand. And I think there is more opportunity there as, again, we look at helping them grow in their marketplaces, particularly as health care reform evolves. I can't imagine the challenge today of running a health plan, and having a partner like us that can at least take the evolving pharmacy component to providing care to the folks that are today in the marketplace, but as that marketplace changes, positions us really, really well. Our technology, our single platform, all those things we think makes us a very attractive partner. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And then, just a last clarification on the retention rates. I think you talked about 95% to 98%. So if you can just remind us of the methodology? Is it retention rates as a percent of revenue? If so, does that also include Anthem, or is it a percent of scripts? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. It's a percent of scripts. And it's a – we've had the same methodology for years. Yes, it is a percent of scripts. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And it includes Anthem in it? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. That's correct. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. I guess, just to get kind of back to thinking about the core business, Tim, in a world beyond Anthem. It looks like core profitability ex-Anthem still screens a bit higher than your closest peers. So I guess, as we try to think about the absorption of these fixed costs that won't be able to be eliminated, if and when Anthem does roll off, could you maybe just give us some context around – looks like the core business, ex-Anthem, what you're providing today, looks like it's around $4.10 EBITDA per claim. Is there anything directionally you can help us think through as far as what that number would look like once you're fully exited from Anthem? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Well, I mean, we've shown you what the core is without Anthem. And what I would say about our – let me say this about our core EBITDA per script. First of all, we have a long history that predates me as a CEO here of managing costs extraordinarily well. And so, one component of being better than the other guys at EBITDA per script is managing costs really, really well. I said that, when we had a competitor that no longer exists, that was out there talking about how they could do it for – they were making $2 a script to our, at the time, I think $3.50. And the answer then, which proved out to be correct was, they're making $2 a script not because they're selling themselves cheaper, but because their cost structure is more. And that we could beat their price points and actually have better EBITDA because of our efficiency. That continues, and that will continue to be a hallmark of our company. But I think the other thing that's important – and you saw it in the 2015 to 2016 jump in profitability of the core – is that in 2016, we had a great number of levers in our hands that we told you, in 2017, some of those are not in our hands. But when we look forward the next three to four years, they come back into our hands. Retail, big negotiations. We had a Walgreens negotiations last year. Our SafeGuardRx programs, last year was a banner year for launching those. We don't have quite as many we're launching this year, and we pulled a lot of enrollment into last year by virtue of client interest. And so what you saw in 2016 was that the EBIT grew over 6% in the core. To me – and by the way, clients' drug spends – or drug trends, surprisingly to some, but not to us, dropped 27%. And we saved our clients billions and added a couple hundred million to incremental EBITDA, particularly if you factor out cost savings that also contributed to our EBIT growth in 2016. So, when I look at that, that says, wow, your core model performs particularly well when you align with clients, you drive down their costs, you launch the kind of programs that get the kind of enrollments we saw. And when we look forward, we see tremendous opportunities to do that. And so I fully expect that you will see moderate growth in EBITDA per script in the core as a result of us continuing to innovate, do the things Steve and Glen are doing, and that clients need. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. That's fair. And then I guess, just, Tim, I know you're not giving EPS guidance, but obviously having the goal of double-digit. Just to be clear, that would be reflective of the company in its entirety over the next three years, including any residual profit you'll be getting from Anthem. Is that right? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. I would say that's right. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Hey, Tim. Just to follow up on that last question from Bob on pricing and EBITDA per script. So how do you address investor concerns about what's seemingly becoming a more competitive environment, with Prime and Optum emerging as more aggressive players? And tying that with EBITDA per script visibility that you just provided to the Street and to your clients today. So, if I'm a client sitting on the sidelines seeing this EBITDA per script, how do you calm those clients down and say that we're not over-earning on your book? And how do you address investor concerns about that? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So, first of all, even the core EBITDA per script we showed you, I need to point out, includes some significant services business that our – through our DFO (58:07) formulary business, similar to what we have with Catamaran. And so again, some of that backs out. But I can tell you, clients, by and large – I don't think I've ever had a consultant say to me, your EBITDA per script is too high compared to somebody else's. They look at their clients' pricing compared to the marketplace. They look at their clients' pricing and outcomes based on commitments we make, risks we take, programs we enroll them in, drug trend results. That's the stuff, quite frankly, that either causes you to win or lose a client. Now that being said, from my perspective, we always have to continue to drive at our cost structure and so forth. And I think there was a study that came out from Dezante (58:44) just a couple months ago that showed a six to one return on PBM services to payers, if you looked at what they were paying all in. I can tell you that our clients are seeing that or better, and our job is going to be to continue to demonstrate our value. And as long as we demonstrate our value, I'm not concerned about what our EBITDA per script is. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC No, I appreciate that. And just a follow-up for Eric. So if you're committing 30% of operating cash to debt pay-down over the next three years, I mean the math just basically says we should expect a lower level of buybacks over that same period, right? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes, based on that, it takes on average of about that 30% to get us down to around a two times leverage in 2020. So, that's the math. It may be a little more or less in any one year, but on average, that's what it will take. And the remainder, as I said in my prepared notes, subject to internal investment and M&A, the rest will be committed to share buybacks. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Hey. Eric, any levers you can pull to push the cash flow generation up a little bit near-term? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Materially, probably not. We continue to work, from a working capital perspective, to maximize the working capital aspect. But absent that, it's growth in the business, growth in EBITDA, that will be the main driver. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Operator, we'll take one more call, but I know we're at the bottom of the hour. Operator Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the beginning of a contract with a new client. And if you want to talk about Anthem, that'd be helpful. But obviously in the beginning, there's a lot of up-front costs, which you alluded to in your written comments on the release last night. So I know that $2.2 billion is the adjusted EBITDA number for Anthem in 2016. But can you talk about the first couple of years? Was it negative in the first year? Or what was that number? And then, in the second year? And when did it officially become profitable for you? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Well, so it underperformed right out of the chute in terms of the volume they delivered. I can tell you I wasn't here at that time, so I can't speak to the – some of the conversations that would have been had with them, but I know it underperformed. They began in effect for the first probably until after the Medco acquisition, this thing underperformed the financial assumptions that the board and the leadership team of this company committed to in order to write the $4.7 billion check, which turned out to be a very good investment for them and their stock. Our investment looked a little more risky in those early years because of the poor volume and the poor growth. What I would tell you is, after getting the Medco deal done, it allowed us to rationalize our infrastructure aggressively, which we did. It also allowed us to go back out to the supply chain, and even in the non-tightly managed business gain additional leverage. And the way that their contract was written, we were able to gain share as rebates increased and so forth in a way that finally began to turn this thing around just in the last couple of years. And so from that standpoint, again, and this is very different. Let me just, again, reemphasize. I can't – there's no other contract we have that's remotely similar as it relates to those dynamics, because we typically, you know, from that standpoint, don't give up front money at all. We don't buy a functioning, or in this case a sanctioned pharmacy to operate it. We typically come in and provide services. So this was very, very different. And so, again, the management team at the time at Anthem, again, I can't speak for them, but I believe they didn't see the generic discounts increasing as aggressively as they have in the market because of us and others doing our job. I believe they didn't see brand inflation being as high as it was in the outer years. And so I believe that, you know, there's certainly some sound bites that they thought they took some pretty good risk on this deal and they were going to be winners. You know what? I think they were winners. We got them back in business. We gave them a great pharmacy product. We're aligned like heck with them. We've taken great care of their members. We've done that without them enrolling in some of our most tightly-managed programs, some of those they are now more recently enrolling in, such as tightly-managed formularies. And in the end now, we've got a snapshot, but when you see the movie, you see that this thing, you know, required a lot of work on our part to get to the point where it is today. And obviously, I'd love nothing more than to have them call me back and give us the chance to service their patients over the long-term, but that's not my decision to make. Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC It seems like certainly that would at least make sense for them to consider. Okay. Thank you very much. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. I want to thank everybody for your interest and for your support today. Obviously it's been a long year and a bit. We've talked a lot about trying to improve our disclosure to you. Hopefully what you see today and moving forward is a real commitment to our shareholders to growing our core and to making you look really smart by being investors in our company. So thank you.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Thanks very much, and good morning. Tim, let me start with my first question which would be around client flight risk. In talking to investors last night and this morning, it appears that people are thinking back to when Medco lost some clients, and then you obviously announced you were going to merge with Express Scripts. I viewed that as more of the merger versus the loss of clients, but can you maybe just spend a couple of minutes talking about how you're thinking about potential loss of any client, or any changes in the negotiation with your current client base? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure, Lisa, and good morning. Thanks for the question. So let me start with, our clients understand that the contract we have with Anthem, as I just said, is dramatically different. The up-front money that they demanded in 2009 and the contract that also followed it, specifically the market check language in that contract, which is very different, or the periodic market review language, as it's called in the contract. So our clients understand that. As you can imagine, we haven't just started talking to them about this this year. Anthem has been out for quite a period of time. They filed a lawsuit a year ago now. And we have a strong playbook in terms of how we talk with clients. And I can tell you very quickly, the conversation pivots to, okay, let's talk about what you can do for me in terms of drug trend, in terms of programs, and so forth. I think the Medco situation was very different due to a few things that I won't detail now, but suffice it to say we have a strong relationship with our clients. The feedback I've had, and I've obviously spoken with a few already, has been extraordinarily supportive. And you know, quite frankly, if Anthem isn't interested in receiving $3 billion over the next three years that would be tremendously valuable to them, we're going to invest that as well into the core of this business and drive our solutions even further and faster. And I think our clients are going to benefit directly from that, and that's what I'm sharing with them. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan And then if I can just, maybe just a couple points of clarification here. When we talk about the EBITDA attributable to Anthem, I just want to make sure that we understand that EBITDA is all-inclusive of all the benefit that you're getting around – for example, I know they're not on your national formulary, but you're probably purchasing on their behalf or negotiating on their behalf, right? And so there's probably some benefit within the EBITDA there. And so as we think about that, number one, I'd want to confirm that. And then secondly, how do we think about the run-rate over the next couple of years? There was a nice jump from 2015 to 2016, and I think that was, again, due to the incremental contracting of what you're doing out in the marketplace around pharmaceutical costs. But I just want to understand those two factors; all-inclusive on the EBITDA line, and then secondly, as we think about the run-rate over the next couple of years, should we see an incremental step-up in 2017, 2018, 2019? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So let me start, and I'll let Eric add any color. First of all, let me say this as simply as I know how to. If Anthem were to leave today, the EBITDA that we've showed you – we would have work to do, first of all, obviously, which is the work we're doing, as I talked about, costs. But we would not see the EBITDA attributable to the core decrease because of some lost leverage that we would be gaining by virtue today, by virtue of having Anthem. Let me say it a different way, and you kind of said it. They don't participate in our national preferred formulary. We will have 25 million members who we take to the table when we negotiate with pharma. Not one of those is an Anthem member. That will continue. So they've gone, you know, we've supported them, they've gained our scale and our ability to contract at scale. They've gained from that, but I can tell you from the broad book of business, that's not the case. And so our EBITDA on the core is very much what you would expect going forward. As it relates to – and by the way, the other piece is obviously in our mail service and GPO leverage, Anthem is not particularly high mail, and our ability to negotiate with generic manufacturers, remember, we're still at over 1.2 billion prescriptions overall, we still have a strong mail service franchise and 90-day franchise generally, our ability to negotiate there will not be diminished by virtue of Anthem's 200 million claims. As it relates to the run-rate, what I would just say is, listen, Anthem, as you saw, and I assume you mean the run-rate for Anthem, Anthem has grown. And I would expect over the next three years as they put in programs that we've – they've been working with us to put in programs to drive down pharmacy costs, we benefit when those programs are put in and so do they. So I would expect to and I frankly hope to grow Anthem's profitability and EBITDA over the next three years as we put solutions in and as we continue to use our their behalf, separately from our book of business. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Quickly, do you expect that that's going to grow materially? You're talking about 1% to 3% this year, kind of 2% to 4% on a core run rate basis. When we think about the Anthem business and the 14% growth you saw last year, would you think that that's kind of growth or would you say it's probably going to be more in line with the Express overall growth? I think that from an investment perspective, people are just trying to get an idea of where this will be when you exit the relationship in 2019? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure. I would expect that what you should see is kind of what you've seen with our core, which is it will be more in line with – you know, the EBITDA any given year is a function of, even in this contract, a function of how much opportunity does the supply chain sort of have in terms of creating competition? Whether that's going and renegotiated rebates because new products come out, whether that's putting in programs, whether that's new generics, et cetera. And so, I would anticipate, while we aren't going to give forward-looking guidance on just Anthem, it's probably going to perform similar to what we've said for the core. Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Okay, I'll stop there, thank you. Operator Thank you, the next question comes from Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Hey, Tim and Eric, can you speak to the 2% to 4% EBITDA CAGR that you're throwing out there? What are assumptions around new business in terms of a driver of that? And then just secondarily, I think the story is more predicated on you getting the capital deployed productively over the next few years on deals. Can you help us, Tim, I know you've had some kind of high level guidelines for kinds of things that are interesting, but isn't it more critical now to offer a bit more granularity on the kinds of capabilities that might help you fill any Anthem hole that does materialize. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure, so I'll take first – the contribution of new business is, is a component, but I would not say it's the driving component, Robert. As you know, when we win new business, it's typically, you know, less-penetrated than the things that are valuable to us and over a series of years we penetrate it better. Now I will tell you, retention continues to be a key goal of ours, and in making sure we invest in solutions that maintain the value we create for clients. And so – but we also do target winning new business. And we think over the next three years we anticipate that we will add materially to our client base, but I would also tell you that winning at all costs is not only not required, it's not the strategy. And so we intend to compete well in the new sales space. We think our solutions differentiate us meaningfully. We get that feedback from the marketplace. In this selling season we continue to see good response to that, but it's not the core driver. As it relates to deals, you know, listen, I, we're not going to tell you what we're looking at. I can tell you, we're extraordinarily engaged in things. We're going to deploy our cash really carefully though. It's not to say that we will or won't do a deal, it's to say we are going to be really thoughtful about how we invest in ourselves, how we, both through technology, investments and other internal investments, deploy it back to shareholders, and then we do look at M&A. We do like cost containment and payer services sorts of opportunities. We like niche opportunities in areas like worker's compensation and specialty, we are interested in healthcare analytics or medical management. Those are some of the areas that we're looking at out across the broader market as things that will potentially diversify and help our EBIT beyond the core grow. And so we are very, very intentional in those areas. And I think if you were to talk to, you know, pick your fiddler, talk to – pick your favorite three investment bankers, they would tell you that we're – we read everything, but we're engaging very, very meaningfully. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC And just a clarification, Tim, just the magnitude of the pipeline of opportunities. Would it be realist to assume something could get done this year that would be noteworthy, or is it just impossible to predict and it could be year three before we see anything additive? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. You know, I don't want to predict. I don't think you should expect – I'm not going to give you any timelines. As much as we're holding ourselves to doing the right deal. And that timing will then ripen however it manifests itself. I would love to see us make sure that we take good care of our cash. And I'll tell you, depending on where things are at right now, buying our stock back is not going to be a bad use until such time as we find something that's also terribly strategically interesting, not just from a cash perspective. The other thing I'd say, Bob is you know, beyond just deals, I think this core business is built to engage differently with the healthcare supply chain and the – and the health, and the broadly-defined healthcare services piece. And whether you look at what we've done with blank and Lilly, with Mango, with value-based manufacture agreements, with the diabetes program with Walgreens, with what we did for a major health plan in California as it relates to performance-based retail network, etc. etc. We actually see a pipeline of very interesting opportunities there that don't require us to invest billions of dollars, but actually can leverage innovation and our natural core in very unique ways, and you should expect to hear more about that over the next six months to eighteen months as much as anything else around a more traditional deal flow. Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is open. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you. Could you speak to your methodology with allocation of fixed and corporate expense relative to the three, I guess three segmentations, but really what I'm interested also is how you arrived at, or whether any intention to drive down the total EBITDA associated with Anthem, and what we will be left with at core Express Scripts? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes, Eric. So as to our allocation methodology, as we presented in the press release, we're showing adjusted EBITDA from the pieces of the business. So included in there below the margin is a portion of the variable costs. And as it relates to Anthem, if and when it goes, we'd expect those costs to ratably come out as the business goes out. We also allocate a portion of fixed costs. I will tell you that's at a level that's less than their revenue. But on a fixed cost basis, we look department by department, person by person. We've had a very, very refined methodology that we've used over time that looks across the organization, and anything that can be specifically identified to a client is done that way. And then from there, we look at various factors including prescriptions, lives and revenue to allocate remaining costs. Now to that basis, as Tim talked about in his prepared remarks, we have always been and will continue to be very, very cost-focused. We have three more years before this contract is up, and we have a mind and an eye to cost reduction between now and then. We know what those fixed costs are that have been allocated, and we know what has to be taken out as we approach 2020. So hopefully, that addresses your question. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. And history would suggest that these type of contracts tend to roll off over multiple years. How do you think about, or what have you seen, in terms of your ability to reduce costs and how that rolls over the one, two, three years that takes to ramp down? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes. So we are – obviously have been planning for this and are very laser-focused on that. As to that roll-off, what we do know is the contract goes through the end of 2019. So the roll-off couldn't begin until after that date. And then that's entirely up to them. But as we have seen, whether it be through our united contracts, through the Coventry, Catamaran, these things typically take years, not a year. So – but we can't predict that, but we will be lined up to take the costs out accordingly, with whatever timing the roll-off is. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. And, Tim, you've always stated a commitment to serving the customer. If they – if Anthem comes to you and says, we want three years as we build it out ourselves. Is there a point at which you turn off the key? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Well – so, I'd start by reminding you that we have a one-year obligation. And after that, quite frankly, it's a negotiable item. And what I would tell you is listen, we're never going to put patients in the middle. We're never going to be in a situation where there's a member who is an Anthem member who can't get what they need. But I can also tell you that, from our perspective, we've got – we're moving on. That's the message you should get today is, we have a strong core. We've been trying for a year to find a way forward here. We still – the door is always open here. I'd be much more open for an extension of this contract that we've been trying to get done at market rates in exchange for some up-front money that nobody else can give them. So, the conversations that we will have as it relates to what happens after 2020 haven't started, and we, quite frankly, will be in a situation where, what we'll have to do is make sure we're taking care of all the rest of our long-term clients, while at the same time not putting their patients in the middle. Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you for that. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Dave MacDonald of SunTrust. Your line is open. David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Guys, look, I just have one question left. I was wondering, Tim, can you provide just a bit more detail? You talk a little bit about exception pricing, how often this happens, how key you think that is to helping them win. And when you guys have these – have had these conversations about trying to renew the contract, how often does a topic like that come up? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. It's – over the years, it's come up a lot. I mean, and it's come up in different ways. As you would recall in the beginning of this contract, you may recall, Anthem underperformed wickedly the script volume that was initially built into the business. It was one of the risks, frankly, that George and the team at the time were taking, was on volume. And so, from our standpoint, we've worked hard over the years to help them grow by giving them exception pricing on something like 400 individual accounts, mostly on larger national accounts, as you can appreciate, which was not contractually obligated, but we felt it was the right thing to do. We would clearly benefit, and they would clearly benefit from being able to win and grow their national account business. In addition, when they bought Amerigroup, we constantly updated their pricing on the Medicaid business, and that's why they moved Amerigroup's lives to us early. That was not contractually required, but we thought it was important to do. We've helped them on Medicare Part D, not only operationally, getting them off sanctions, but also actually in continuing to improve their rates there. And so – and it's all been just, you know, listen, we are aligned to grow Anthem. We're aligned to grow them, you know, we've been aligned to grow them since 2009. And so, we have been very strategic about working with them to help them win in various marketplaces. And so, as we look forward obviously, you know, the exception pricing process is not contractually required, and it's something that will probably be less critical in the future, but it has been something that we've worked very well with them on, leading up to now. David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Garen Sarafian of Citi Research. Your line is open. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Good morning, Tim and Eric. So first, a follow-up on a prior question regarding the long-term EBITDA growth, 2% to 4%. So you mentioned there's a little bit of a contribution from new client wins, but not much. So, could you just break it down a little bit more? If volume is growing, the data that we're seeing is maybe 1% to 2%, and there's a little bit of new client wins baked into that 2% to 4%. So wondering, just how you guys are thinking about it? If you can give a little bit more clarity. And sort of what the margin is on a per-script basis with no additions? Are you assuming it to be flat? Even down? Up? If you can offer more? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So I'll give you a – my first crack at it. If we didn't grow volume at all, to us, and if I look at the – let's take the 2% to 4% range that we gave you, and just dissect that sort of at a macro level. If we get a headwind on volume, whether that's new wins or utilization, we see that as plus or minus a half a basis point in that overall – 50 basis points, rather – in that sort of total 2% to 4% equation. You probably have a couple of percent of growth that sits in our product programs, our management of pricing effectively, so that can be a negative, but that's factored in there. When we look at supply chain management and the opportunities when we look out, and as you can imagine, we aren't just projecting sort of blindly here. We underwrite every day and take risk three years out. And so, we looked at that as we looked at the contribution existing clients over the next three years would have. We look at inflation, both brand and generic inflation, and factor that in. Again, when you take all of that, the product program, supply chain management, inflation, that has the potential to contribute, I would say, at least 1% to 2% EBITDA growth a year, on average, CAGR. From a standpoint of then, you've got specialty which, independent from that, we see specialty being a significant growth driver for us. We're having very great success on the pharma side getting access to limited medications. And then obviously, we've won several of the larger independent freestanding specialty bids that were out there over the last year or so. So we're competing well in specialty. And then finally expenses, which again, can be half a point to a point for us in terms of this. So, when you break it all down, and I'm not going to get more discrete than that, because obviously the world gives us opportunities that we can't even envision sitting here, and our job is to take advantage of them and drive client savings and keep a little bit for ourselves. But that's generally broadly the way to think about it. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. No, fair enough. And then, you mentioned here in this response now, as well as Eric in, I think, the prepared responses, regarding supply chain initiatives in the back-half of the year. So sort of piggybacking on that, last year, you used up your last extension of the contract you have with your current distributor. So maybe last year could have been due to uncertainty with where you were going to be with Anthem. So, given yesterday and today's news, how does your current assumption of Anthem influence your procurement strategy, both near term for this year, the back half of the year what's going on other than just the renewal and also just longer term? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. It really doesn't change it materially. I mean our job is to make sure that we have a relationship with our distributor that is both from a unit cost standpoint and a strategy standpoint well aligned with our growth of our core in the future. Anthem, quite frankly, again, they're – they obviously are a significant part of our EBITDA, as we've shown you. As a percentage of our claims that we manage though, and as a percentage of mail specifically, they're actually much lower percentage than they are of the EBITDA. And so I believe if you were to ask our current distributor, they would say they very much want to retain our business and be a strategic partner to us. And we will end the process this year with a strategic partner that is delivering real value to us. And I can tell you, ABC has done a great job for us, and my preference is to make sure that what we do for the next three years works as well as the last three years, whether that's with ABC or anybody else. And I can tell you that again, that's a process we're going through. And we'll – probably we or they will have more to report out to you shortly. Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is open. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Hi. Thanks very much. Tim, looking beyond Anthem, can you remind us what your rough client mix would be across the book of business? And how do you feel about that? Do you view it as balanced or you think there's work to do there? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. If you take Anthem out, we have a really nicely-balanced book. I would tell you that taking care of our – particularly – if you look at health plans, because obviously Anthem's a large health plan – and they're in multiple lines of business, we're really, really pleased with the relationship we have with major regional players who need what we do at scale. And so our health plan book to business, both the big national or the big blues names that you would recognize as well as other regional players or niche players that play in just one particular line, whether that's Medicaid or Medicare, is a very strong book of business that are trying to compete with the big national players and need a partner like us. From an employer standpoint, that's sort of a legacy book for us and we're pleased with it. We think some of the dynamics in the United States today lend themselves to tighter labor markets, and therefore employers looking to continue to have terrific employment conditions, including benefits for their folks, but do it affordably. And so we think that, that strong book is good. And then the middle market continues to be – what defines the middle market anymore for us, and what it would be self-insured in that market continues to grow as the costs have grown. And we have a unique set of solutions for that marketplace as well that again, that book is a strong book that we continue to grow very nicely. So I really – if I look across the piece, I think that we have a terrific blended book of business. Obviously, the – if you look at the DoD and the federal part, we're very proud of not only our footprint with the DoD but a number of other federal clients. And we see opportunities to grow that book fairly significantly over the next two to three years. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. And one last thing. You mentioned value-based pricing a few times. Can you just expand a bit on what your strategy is? How broadly is that being adopted by your clients? And do you see it continuing to be sort of indication-specific, or do you see maybe an opportunity to broaden it out across, perhaps, a full population utilization? Thanks. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So I'll start, and I'm actually going to – I've got Dr. Steve Miller here who can expand a little bit more on the – sort of how what we're thinking about it in the future. What I would say is this: our enrollment in these programs is amazing. Steve stood up at our Outcomes conference just a couple of years ago and basically asked the crowd, is there anybody that's going to stand with us if we approach some manufacturers in oncology for some value-based arrangements in a couple of places? And hundreds of clients immediately texted their support because they didn't have any partner that was able to do this for them. Their health plans were struggling with this. And we stepped forward. And now when you look at these programs, we have enrollment and inflation protection, for example, of almost 30 million lives. But if you get into the cardiovascular and others, there are over 20 million lives. The newer ones are anywhere from 6 million to 15 million lives. And so – and we've got several more in the chamber as well. So we see this as a long-term chassis to continue to not only innovate but also to optimize over time. And so if you look at cardiovascular, which started with the PCSK9 launch, we've now been able to evolve that program as the PCSK9s have expanded their indications to make sure that we provide patient access where it appropriate but also make sure that we do the management of those patients, and then the cost management in the class. But looking forward, we think that is a tremendous chassis. And, Steve, I'll let you provide any additional color to the question. Steven B. Miller - Express Scripts Holding Co. Only briefly add a couple comments, and that is this has been incredibly popular. When we introduced it to the marketplace, very few people could do it. To this day, very few companies can actually do it. They talk about doing value-based contracting. We've actually been in the business for several years. As Tim already mentioned, we have over 20 million patients participating every day in our SafeGuardRx programs. Those programs continue to expand. Glen Stettin in the product area and others continue to add new modules to it. In the coming year, you're going to see additional modules in multiple sclerosis, in respiratory diseases, two huge categories. And so we think the popularity of this will continue to grow. And when you look at our Drug Trend Report, you can actually see the real impact it's having on employers' expenses. So we're very excited about this area. John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC Thanks very much. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Yes. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, just want to go back to some of your comments around Anthem here. The way you kind of make it sound is that you're still open to dialogue here. Can you give a sense – but from what you're hearing from Anthem, would you say that this is sort of a closed-and-done decision? Or do you think there's still room for further discussion? And secondly, how often is it that a client doesn't give an incumbent a look at the RFP? Thanks. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure. When you're servicing a client as well – I'll answer the second part of your question – when you're servicing a client as well as we're servicing Anthem, it's unheard of to not have the chance to renew the client, quite frankly. Even when they go out and look at the market, which they're – which they do. So from that standpoint, to me it's very unusual. But this is an unusual contract, so I started my remarks with that. What I would say is – I don't want to be glib and say go ask Anthem, because I have to take their statements at face value. I mean, obviously, this decision to disclose not only what we make on Anthem but gives you visibility to the core, was not taken lightly. It was taken in the context of a number of conversations that have occurred over the last 90 days, and the last conversation being one where it was very clear that – the last conversation where they reached out to us where it was very clear that they said they were moving on. So let me be clear about that. So I have to take that at face value. Do I hope – are we going to continue to service their members? Yes. Do I hope that we are – ultimately that they rethink their – at least what they told us? Absolutely. I mean we represent the best choice for them. I frankly cannot imagine how their shareholders can withstand not looking at $3 billion worth of value that nobody else can give them. And I just don't understand it, and so we remain absolutely committed to serving them, serving their patients. And my door is always going to be open and my phone will always be in my pocket, hoping that I get that call. But you know what? As of this day, it was our responsibility to provide this visibility. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC That's helpful and thanks. And then you talked about – you've talked earlier here about the long-term growth, and you talked about 2% to 4% on EBITDA here. When we think down then to EPS, can you give us any sense on where you think sort of the long-term earnings power is here, obviously, with deploying capital, et cetera? Do you think we can maintain sort of a – at least a double-digit earnings growth trajectory? Thanks. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes. Obviously, we aren't giving you EPS guidance today. But I can – anyone that knows me or knows our board knows that we're very aligned on setting and achieving high targets. And we – listen, it's obvious. You can model it out. Over the next three years, we're going to produce a tremendous amount of cash which we will deploy very thoughtfully. And from where I'm sitting, I'll leave it to you to model. But we would be targeting something that is in the double digits. Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Thanks a lot. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yes. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the first one, can you help us frame the opportunity to achieve cost savings into context of the Anthem contract? So how should we think about SG&A cost associated with it? What percent of total company SG&A are you allocating? I mean should we assume SG&A's allocated equally across all your customers, or is the SG&A spend towards the Anthem contract is lower because they don't use mail, or they don't use your national formulary as much? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So, Ricky, I'm going to let Eric answer, but I want to actually remind everyone, because I recognize cost allocation is pretty important to us. We've got the DoD as a client, and they have a very detailed requirement around cost accounting that we have implemented a number of years ago. It was right when I joined here that we actually kind of took that to the next level. So I'll let Eric actually answer your question, but I think it's important to note that we have a great team in our finance group here and our legal group that's spent untold hours making sure that we've thoughtfully allocated our cost as best as possible so that what we gave you was a reliable set of numbers that we could then begin quarter-to-quarter to share with you. But in terms of your specific question, I'll turn it over to Eric to talk about the specific kind of proportionality. Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes, and so we're not going to get into the exact percentage. As Tim mentioned, and I mentioned before, this is a very sophisticated process we go through. Nothing was changed. It's been reviewed, and again, as Tim mentioned, when you have government clients, anybody that has ever contracted with them, you know what you have to go through in cost allocation. So all of that has been reviewed in the past. I will tell you that their allocation per RX is slightly under our core allocation. And then as it comes to cost reduction, we have various programs that we have begun to look at our costs over the next three years with a mind of reducing SG&A. We will keep you updated as we progress throughout the year. We're not yet ready to roll-out exactly what our commitments are going to be, but as we progress, it is our intent to do that. So again, very, very cost-focused. Focused on theirs, and again, with the mind-set when we get out to 2020 and 2021, subject to what happens, we know we have some fixed cost absorption that we have to be prepared to absorb. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And then, Tim, the health plan business obviously is an important strategic business for you. Recently you highlighted also that Part D is an important growth area for Express. If you do end up losing Anthem, how do you rebuild your managed care presence and your commitment to growing that Part D business? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Sure. Well we start with the fact that, again, as I said, we've got a terrific group of clients beyond Anthem, and we've been focused on helping the m grow in their markets. And they would expect to continue to see us do that, and we will double-down on helping those clients grow in their markets. That's the most important thing. But secondly, listen, there are a number of large and fairly large health plans that need first-class PBM services. Not going to speculate how things are going to shake out over the next couple of years, but we see a number of opportunities to be a valued partner for national or regional health plans, either as a full-service PBM or again, we have seen great success in being able to sell to the marketplace key aspects of our overall scale to help them then achieve their objectives. And so I think what you would expect is that over time we're going to be looking at all of those opportunities. I mean, our Blues plans, we've got decades of experience with some of our Blues plans and we have built an entire organization around understanding their brand, enhancing their brand, helping them build their brand. And I think there is more opportunity there as, again, we look at helping them grow in their marketplaces, particularly as health care reform evolves. I can't imagine the challenge today of running a health plan, and having a partner like us that can at least take the evolving pharmacy component to providing care to the folks that are today in the marketplace, but as that marketplace changes, positions us really, really well. Our technology, our single platform, all those things we think makes us a very attractive partner. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And then, just a last clarification on the retention rates. I think you talked about 95% to 98%. So if you can just remind us of the methodology? Is it retention rates as a percent of revenue? If so, does that also include Anthem, or is it a percent of scripts? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. It's a percent of scripts. And it's a – we've had the same methodology for years. Yes, it is a percent of scripts. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC And it includes Anthem in it? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. That's correct. Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for the question. I guess, just to get kind of back to thinking about the core business, Tim, in a world beyond Anthem. It looks like core profitability ex-Anthem still screens a bit higher than your closest peers. So I guess, as we try to think about the absorption of these fixed costs that won't be able to be eliminated, if and when Anthem does roll off, could you maybe just give us some context around – looks like the core business, ex-Anthem, what you're providing today, looks like it's around $4.10 EBITDA per claim. Is there anything directionally you can help us think through as far as what that number would look like once you're fully exited from Anthem? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Well, I mean, we've shown you what the core is without Anthem. And what I would say about our – let me say this about our core EBITDA per script. First of all, we have a long history that predates me as a CEO here of managing costs extraordinarily well. And so, one component of being better than the other guys at EBITDA per script is managing costs really, really well. I said that, when we had a competitor that no longer exists, that was out there talking about how they could do it for – they were making $2 a script to our, at the time, I think $3.50. And the answer then, which proved out to be correct was, they're making $2 a script not because they're selling themselves cheaper, but because their cost structure is more. And that we could beat their price points and actually have better EBITDA because of our efficiency. That continues, and that will continue to be a hallmark of our company. But I think the other thing that's important – and you saw it in the 2015 to 2016 jump in profitability of the core – is that in 2016, we had a great number of levers in our hands that we told you, in 2017, some of those are not in our hands. But when we look forward the next three to four years, they come back into our hands. Retail, big negotiations. We had a Walgreens negotiations last year. Our SafeGuardRx programs, last year was a banner year for launching those. We don't have quite as many we're launching this year, and we pulled a lot of enrollment into last year by virtue of client interest. And so what you saw in 2016 was that the EBIT grew over 6% in the core. To me – and by the way, clients' drug spends – or drug trends, surprisingly to some, but not to us, dropped 27%. And we saved our clients billions and added a couple hundred million to incremental EBITDA, particularly if you factor out cost savings that also contributed to our EBIT growth in 2016. So, when I look at that, that says, wow, your core model performs particularly well when you align with clients, you drive down their costs, you launch the kind of programs that get the kind of enrollments we saw. And when we look forward, we see tremendous opportunities to do that. And so I fully expect that you will see moderate growth in EBITDA per script in the core as a result of us continuing to innovate, do the things Steve and Glen are doing, and that clients need. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. That's fair. And then I guess, just, Tim, I know you're not giving EPS guidance, but obviously having the goal of double-digit. Just to be clear, that would be reflective of the company in its entirety over the next three years, including any residual profit you'll be getting from Anthem. Is that right? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. I would say that's right. Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks so much. Operator Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Hey, Tim. Just to follow up on that last question from Bob on pricing and EBITDA per script. So how do you address investor concerns about what's seemingly becoming a more competitive environment, with Prime and Optum emerging as more aggressive players? And tying that with EBITDA per script visibility that you just provided to the Street and to your clients today. So, if I'm a client sitting on the sidelines seeing this EBITDA per script, how do you calm those clients down and say that we're not over-earning on your book? And how do you address investor concerns about that? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. So, first of all, even the core EBITDA per script we showed you, I need to point out, includes some significant services business that our – through our DFO (58:07) formulary business, similar to what we have with Catamaran. And so again, some of that backs out. But I can tell you, clients, by and large – I don't think I've ever had a consultant say to me, your EBITDA per script is too high compared to somebody else's. They look at their clients' pricing compared to the marketplace. They look at their clients' pricing and outcomes based on commitments we make, risks we take, programs we enroll them in, drug trend results. That's the stuff, quite frankly, that either causes you to win or lose a client. Now that being said, from my perspective, we always have to continue to drive at our cost structure and so forth. And I think there was a study that came out from Dezante (58:44) just a couple months ago that showed a six to one return on PBM services to payers, if you looked at what they were paying all in. I can tell you that our clients are seeing that or better, and our job is going to be to continue to demonstrate our value. And as long as we demonstrate our value, I'm not concerned about what our EBITDA per script is. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC No, I appreciate that. And just a follow-up for Eric. So if you're committing 30% of operating cash to debt pay-down over the next three years, I mean the math just basically says we should expect a lower level of buybacks over that same period, right? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Yes, based on that, it takes on average of about that 30% to get us down to around a two times leverage in 2020. So, that's the math. It may be a little more or less in any one year, but on average, that's what it will take. And the remainder, as I said in my prepared notes, subject to internal investment and M&A, the rest will be committed to share buybacks. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Hey. Eric, any levers you can pull to push the cash flow generation up a little bit near-term? Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co. Materially, probably not. We continue to work, from a working capital perspective, to maximize the working capital aspect. But absent that, it's growth in the business, growth in EBITDA, that will be the main driver. Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Operator, we'll take one more call, but I know we're at the bottom of the hour. Operator Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the beginning of a contract with a new client. And if you want to talk about Anthem, that'd be helpful. But obviously in the beginning, there's a lot of up-front costs, which you alluded to in your written comments on the release last night. So I know that $2.2 billion is the adjusted EBITDA number for Anthem in 2016. But can you talk about the first couple of years? Was it negative in the first year? Or what was that number? And then, in the second year? And when did it officially become profitable for you? Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. Well, so it underperformed right out of the chute in terms of the volume they delivered. I can tell you I wasn't here at that time, so I can't speak to the – some of the conversations that would have been had with them, but I know it underperformed. They began in effect for the first probably until after the Medco acquisition, this thing underperformed the financial assumptions that the board and the leadership team of this company committed to in order to write the $4.7 billion check, which turned out to be a very good investment for them and their stock. Our investment looked a little more risky in those early years because of the poor volume and the poor growth. What I would tell you is, after getting the Medco deal done, it allowed us to rationalize our infrastructure aggressively, which we did. It also allowed us to go back out to the supply chain, and even in the non-tightly managed business gain additional leverage. And the way that their contract was written, we were able to gain share as rebates increased and so forth in a way that finally began to turn this thing around just in the last couple of years. And so from that standpoint, again, and this is very different. Let me just, again, reemphasize. I can't – there's no other contract we have that's remotely similar as it relates to those dynamics, because we typically, you know, from that standpoint, don't give up front money at all. We don't buy a functioning, or in this case a sanctioned pharmacy to operate it. We typically come in and provide services. So this was very, very different. And so, again, the management team at the time at Anthem, again, I can't speak for them, but I believe they didn't see the generic discounts increasing as aggressively as they have in the market because of us and others doing our job. I believe they didn't see brand inflation being as high as it was in the outer years. And so I believe that, you know, there's certainly some sound bites that they thought they took some pretty good risk on this deal and they were going to be winners. You know what? I think they were winners. We got them back in business. We gave them a great pharmacy product. We're aligned like heck with them. We've taken great care of their members. We've done that without them enrolling in some of our most tightly-managed programs, some of those they are now more recently enrolling in, such as tightly-managed formularies. And in the end now, we've got a snapshot, but when you see the movie, you see that this thing, you know, required a lot of work on our part to get to the point where it is today. And obviously, I'd love nothing more than to have them call me back and give us the chance to service their patients over the long-term, but that's not my decision to make. Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC It seems like certainly that would at least make sense for them to consider. Okay. Thank you very much. Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co. I want to thank everybody for your interest and for your support today. Obviously it's been a long year and a bit. We've talked a lot about trying to improve our disclosure to you. Hopefully what you see today and moving forward is a real commitment to our shareholders to growing our core and to making you look really smart by being investors in our company. So thank you.

For fiscal Q2 2017, Micron posted total revenue of $4.65 billion with non-GAAP gross margin of 38.5% and net income of $1.03 billion or $0.90 per share. Revenue was at the top of our guidance while gross margin, operating income and earnings per share exceeded projections. Operating cash flow was $1.8 billion. Last quarter, we provided detailed insight on industry pricing dynamics, explaining how the significant increases over trough pricing for PC DRAM far exceeded what we had seen in other segments which typically react more slowly. This quarter, we saw continued gains in client DRAM pricing but also benefited from increases in mobile, cloud and enterprise pricing as well. All of these segments showed meaningful quarter-over quarter increases. These gains, combined with outstanding progress on cost reductions, led to a significant increase in our DRAM margins. In NAND, we were able to capitalize on an increasing percentage of low-cost 3D TLC NAND by more fully participating in the SSD market. As a result, while blended ASPs were down slightly due to a higher density product mix, our NAND margins improved substantially over last quarter. As we noted in our February analyst conference, we continue to see broad industry trends placing increasing value on the memory and storage technologies we develop and the features those product -- those technologies can provide. In the most recent quarter, you can see that reflected in significant increases in cloud and enterprise businesses, both in bits shipped and value of products going to those segments and in an ongoing preference for SSDs over HDDs in storage platforms. We'll comment more on this when we walk through the specific business details in a moment. From a supply and demand perspective, we continue to be comfortable with market dynamics given the capacity plans we're aware of today. I'll now provide a high-level overview of each of the business units and Ernie will follow on with more details on our financial performance. In the compute and networking business unit, we experienced continued revenue growth as a result of strength across all market segments with particular strength in cloud and enterprise. We began enablement of our 1X nanometer products and extended our lead in graphics technology with the announcement of our next generation GDDR5X product which is the fastest discrete memory available. In our mobile business, as in other segments, broad market tightness has resulted in increased ASPs across all types of mobile memory. Our customers continue to be focused on increased memory and storage density for smartphones which nicely plays to Micron strategy to focus on MCP markets. We plan to introduce more than 20 new MCP designs over the next 12 months to address the highest growth mobile applications. Customers prefer these solutions because they simplify design, validation and supply chain processes. MCPs also provide Micron with an opportunity to strengthen our relationship with key market enablers, providing a path to increased market share. Our embedded business grew revenues this quarter through increased DRAM shipments in automotive as well as consumer and connected home applications and we achieved record automotive revenues for the fourth quarter in a row. Increased NAND shipments to industrial multi-market customers helped offset this quarter's anticipated decline in NOR shipments to Japanese gaming applications. Design and activity continues to be strong for our 20 nanometer DDR and LP DDR products in automotive, consumer, connected home and Internet of Things gateway applications. In addition, design-in activity for our latest generation of automotive grade managed NAND continues to increase with new design wins up significantly over the prior quarter. Our storage business performance this quarter was driven by continued shift to cost-effective 3D NAND TLC products and increased traction for our SSD portfolio across the OEM cloud and enterprise markets. Wins with OEM customers enabled a record number of SSD shipments during the quarter. Customer focus on larger capacity and tailored storage solutions led to a dramatic growth in our enterprise and cloud segments which were our fastest-growing part of our SSD portfolio. The trend toward tailored solution drives greater opportunities for Micron to engage end customers on future IT investment planning. As we pursue these opportunities, our flexible, feature-oriented portfolio has been well received by our customers. The storage market has broadly adopted 3D TLC products and we're well-positioned to take advantage of this trend. We're seeing the ongoing demand for high-performance, reliable, power efficient storage driving greater SSD adoption across multiple markets. We anticipate to grow our overall storage bit output as our Fab 10X expansion continues to ramp. Our technology transitions are on track and will continue to provide benefit to the Company over the next several quarters. We're driving deployment of 1X DRAM with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. We expect 1X nanometer DRAM to build on our success with 20 nanometer DRAM which is deployed throughout our portfolio and rated number one in quality by multiple enterprise OEM customers. Likewise, we're aggressively proliferating 32 layer 3D NAND through our product lines while also driving the deployment of 64 layer 3D NAND with meaningful output expected by the end of the fiscal year. Micron's unique integration of CMOS circuitry under the array will enable the industry's smallest die size on our 64 layer designs. As we look toward the end of our fiscal year, we're currently on track to have more than 75% of our NAND bits on 3D. Of course, certain segments require legacy NAND technologies and will transition much more slowly, embedded markets for example. As we previewed for you at our analyst day, we believe our NAND bit growth in fiscal 2018 will approximate the aggregate market growth. This will take 3D NAND to 90% of our total bit output for fiscal 2018. We continue to work on developing new memory technologies and are enabling our 3D XPoint technology. We will be shipping 3D XPoint memory for revenue later in 2017. We believe these innovative solutions offer unique value to enterprise customers and will be an important contributor to Micron's future success. Now, I'll turn it over to Ernie. Ernie Maddock Thank you Mark. The business environments in fiscal Q2 continued to be positive with our results favorably impacted by product mix, progress on our cost improvement and the sustained positive pricing environment. I'll begin my remarks today with an overview of the fiscal Q2 results by technology and business unit followed by our corporate financial performance and guidance for fiscal Q3. DRAM represented 64% of our total revenue with the following segmentation, mobile was in the high 20% range; PC represented 25%; server also represented 25%, up from the high teens of the prior quarter; and specialty DRAM which includes networking, graphics, auto and other embedded technologies, was in the low 20% range. In our nonvolatile memory business, trade NAND represented 30% of our revenue with the following segmentation, consumer which includes memory cards, U.S.B and components, represented approximately 40%; mobile represented 20%; and as a reminder, EMCPs are primarily in the mobile segment. SSDs were in the mid-20% range, up from the mid-teens percent last quarter. And the automotive, industrial multi-market and other embedded applications were in the high teens percent range. Turning to performance by business unit, the compute and networking business units reported fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.92 billion, up 30% sequentially due to firm demand in a robust pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $736 million or 36% of revenue, up from 14% the prior quarter, enhanced by the pricing environment and better performance on costs. We saw good growth in the cloud and enterprise segments driven by shipments of our first generation 20 nanometer DDR4 products. Additionally, we're beginning shipments of our second generation product optimized for the industry's newest service -- server platform. Graphics saw modest revenue growth despite what is traditionally a seasonally weak period and we began shipments of our next generation G5X to Nvidia for the new GeForce 1080Ti, further solidifying Micron's technology leadership in the high-performance graphics memory segment. Networking saw increased shipments and revenue driven by the continued growth  of 20 nanometer 4 gigabit DDR3 and 8 gigabit DDR4 products at key OEMs, especially in Asia and client revenue growth was primarily driven by the continued strong pricing environment. The mobile business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.08 billion, up 5% sequentially, driven by a stronger pricing environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $170 million or 16% of revenue, as pricing strength combined with improved costs. The embedded business unit delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $590 million, up 2% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $193 million or 33% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by increased automotive unit shipments and increased average selling prices of DDR3 and NAND on a like-for-like basis in our consumer and connected home segments. The storage business delivered fiscal Q2 revenue of $1.04 billion, up 21% sequentially. Non-GAAP operating income was $71 million or 7% of revenue. The results were primarily driven by strong growth in client and cloud SSD shipments and lower costs. Our 5100 cloud drive which was introduced in December, continues to be well received and is in the process of additional calls on a large number of customer platforms. Moving on to overall Company results, revenue for the fiscal second quarter was $4.65 billion, up 17% sequentially and driven primarily by DRAM pricing strength and increased NAND volume shipments in a stable to rising pricing environment. Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 38.5%, up from 26% in the prior quarter, driven by product mix, cost reductions and the strong pricing environment. Non-GAAP net income was $1.03 billion or $0.90 per share. Turning to results by product line, DRAM revenue increased 22% compared to the prior quarter as the result of a 1% increase in bit shipments and a 21% increase in ASPs. DRAM gross margins for the second quarter increased 16 percentage points sequentially to 44% driven primarily by the strong pricing environment and cost declines. As we look at the next couple of quarters, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 10%. Our nonvolatile trade revenue, NAND revenue, increased 11% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting an 18% increase in bit shipments. ASPs were down 6% from the prior quarter on a blended basis, primarily as a result of a higher density product mix. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points sequentially to 31% as cost per bit was down 15%. We're seeing like-for-like price increases across nearly all segments and, looking forward, we expect that second-half fiscal year 2017 bits out will exceed first-half fiscal year 2017 bits out by about 30%, occurring primarily in FQ3. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $612 million, at the midpoint of the guidance range. The Company generated operating cash flow of $1.77 billion, representing an increase of $628 million over last quarter. To conform to GAAP reporting relative to the Inotera acquisition, we reflected approximately $350 million of the Inotera purchase price as a reduction to operating cash flows. As a result, our financial statements reflect operating cash flow of $1.41 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, marketable investments and restricted cash of approximately $4.6 billion. In the second fiscal quarter, capital expenditures net of partner contributions were approximately $1.2 billion. Moving now to our guidance for the third quarter, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect the following, revenue in the range of $5.2 billion to $5.6 billion; gross margin in the range of 44% to 48%; operating expenses between $560 million and $610 million; operating income ranging between $1.8 billion and $2 billion; and EPS ranging between $1.43 and $1.57 per share based on 1.155 billion diluted shares. In closing, we remain focused on achieving the technology transition and cost reduction targets we outlined at our analyst day. Currently, we're tracking to deliver free cash flow in excess of the $1.5 billion we shared with you at that event and continue to view delevering as an important priority. With that, I'll turn it back over to Mark. Mark Durcan Thanks Ernie. In summary, we're heading into the third quarter with a strong market environment and steady progress on our technology initiatives. I'm preleased with our execution and we continue to press forward together on technology, operational and product enablement targets. Our continued progress towards these goals will enable us -- will enable further cost reductions and the opportunity to address higher value-added market segments. Looking to the market as a whole, we see increasing customer interest in Micron playing a more collaborative role in solving design challenges and plan to use this environment to strengthen our relationships with industry partners and customers. As you all know, at our analyst conference in February, I announced my retirement. While the board and I work to identify my successor, I remain fully committed and engaged in leading Micron through this exciting and dynamic period. We will provide further updates on our CEO search as appropriate. Operator, we're now ready to begin Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your question please.  Harlan Sur Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong outlook. Despite the very optimistic and positive pricing environment, there's been some growing concern around the notion of demand destruction given the strong pricing environment and availability of both DRAM and NAND to a point where I think there is a view forming that there's potential for PC and server destocking on the DRAM side, less DRAM per box, on the mobile side, less DRAM per smartphone and on the NAND side, less uptake of SSDs and more uptake of HDDs. I guess the question is do you see this happening and how does it impact the dynamics of the supply-demand environment going forward? Mark Durcan This is Mark. To date, we've seen no indication of that at all really in any segment. It's true that, in cycles, from time to time, that does happen late in a cycle, but, today, we see continued strong bit growth across almost every end market segment and no real indication of that occurring anywhere, in particular not in specialty, not in mobile, certainly not in the enterprise and server area. Harlan Sur Great, thank you for that. And then solid results in the NAND business with your margins up I think it's 800 basis points in the quarter. As we think about the cost curve on a go-forward basis and the ramp of your 64 layer 3D, can you just give us an idea on how your yields and performance of the products are doing either relative to your internal targets or relative to the same time last year in the ramp of your 32 layer products? Mark Durcan This is Mark. A year ago, Harlan, I can't catch that I even recall where we were on 3D NAND yields, but I will tell you we're very happy with where they are for 32 layer MLC and TLC. And again, TLC is the big piece of that. We're where we thought we ought to be and at very mature yields. 64 layer, as we talked about, is a material piece of our bid output late in the year and we're very happy with the progress we're making there and the yields we're seeing on that technology as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please. Steven Fox Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. First of all, if you could talk a little bit more color around this -- I believe you talked about bit growth of about 30% half-over-half. Maybe qualify or quantify as much as you want to the growth drivers, how much from SSDs versus mobile, etc. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the auto growth in the quarter and what's driving that and how that looks into the second half as well and what's the key contributors there? Thank you. Mark Durcan Sure. So relative to bit growth with NAND, that was more statement around what our output profile is going to look like. And of course, we will deploy that output to the end markets that we feel will provide the best opportunity for the Company here as we see the back half of the year unfold. Relative to automotive, it's very similar to what we've been consistently talking about -- driver assist systems, infotainment, a lot of what is required as we move up that autonomous driving food chain and as what are today considered to be advanced features in automotive, the automotive business penetrates mid and lower end cars. So that -- there's nothing particularly unique about what continues to drive that. It's the same unfolding story relative to memory deployment in the automotive sector. Ernie Maddock I think, if the question is do we participate in all of the various pieces of automotive end demand, the answer is yes. We're in the drivetrain. We're in the ADAS systems. We're in the infotainment systems and continue to maintain strong market share in all those pieces. Steven Fox Thanks very much for that. Just real quick on the first comments, on the -- just as it applies to cloud SSDs, your own cloud SSDs that you're launching, can you give a little more color on how broadly we should see those deployed maybe during the fall of this year? Mark Durcan Yes. I think you're going to see them very broadly deployed. As we noted, the initial uptakes of that SSD was announced in the early part of December of last year. The uptake has been very strong and we continue to see that growing at a significant rate here as we progress through the calendar year, along with some new features. We have a 5100 SATA drive with PCIE and NVMe coming soon as well, so we think that will help with the proliferation and the expansion of the demand. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen. Your question please. Timothy Arcuri Thank you very much. I guess, Mark, I'm just looking at the guidance and you guys are guiding to a quarterly earnings number that's like 50% higher than you guys did in the last cycle, yet your stock is still $5.00 below where it peaked last time. And I know there are some changes in the cap structure and whatnot. But I guess the question really is what's the concern you hear from investors when you've been out there on the conference circuit this quarter? Are people worried about the sustainability of the cycle and like what is the big concern from your point of you and is that valid? Mark Durcan It's a good question. I think people are looking at the cycle and wondering are we getting long in the tooth, etc.? We start to read stuff about that. We're not seeing that at all. As mentioned, we're not seeing -- really what's driving this cycle when you think about it is broad-based demand across multiple market segments and in particular it's content growth in all of those segments as opposed to particularly strong unit growth in one segment or the other. And so as we look at the market today, it looks very robust from an end market demand and maybe much broader and less unit-driven than we've seen in the past. We also see that the supply, as best we can tell, seems in control relative to demand. And I think, if you think about this cycle versus last cycle, what you saw -- what you saw last cycle was a big chunk of supply come off with the Hynix fire and the reaction with more supply to replace it and so maybe a little less stability than we're seeing this time around. So that's all on the DRAM side. On the NAND side, this HDD replacement cycle is big. We're well into it in client. It's not going to stop in the cloud and enterprise. Mobile storage demand continues to accelerate. And so, again, it's broad-based content growth in all of those end applications and it's supply on the NAND side that's relatively capital-intensive to put in place with complex technology. And so there, again, that all seems like it's in pretty good shape. Timothy Arcuri Okay. I guess just to follow onto that, so it looks like, based upon the guidance, that the gross margin in DRAM is going to be in excess of 50%. Usually, that doesn't last very long and people are obviously worried about Samsung adding a bunch of wafers. Why would that not happen this time? Based upon what you know, why would that not happen? And sort of what's your -- obviously, they have to add some wafers. But what's your base assumption for what the competition will do sort of in terms of bit growth this year? Thanks. Mark Durcan Again, I think the last cycle was a little different with that instability in supply created by the Hynix fire. I don't know why they would intentionally repeat the mistake from last cycle. They probably are enjoying making good margins. And our view is we just go out and we look at what information is available relative to all the various additions people are making and might be making and what the timeframe that might occur in and then we give you -- you know, what we think that bit growth looks like. And that looks like it's probably actually -- Samsung is actually probably on the low end over the next couple of years relative to what's going on in the industry as a whole. And the industry as a whole is probably a little bit south of where we think demand growth is. So, could it happen? Yes. Why would it happen? I can't forecast that for you. Ernie Maddock This is Ernie. I think the important thing to bear in mind is, in the estimates that we've provided for supply growth this year of 15% to 20%, you would have to add some wafers to get into that range. Absent those wafer additions, you would be below the low end of that range, based on everything that we know. So, it is not a surprise that wafers are being added, given the forecast that we believe exists from the supply side. Mark Durcan And again, the other thing to keep in mind here is there are some natural impediments. The technology is getting more expensive to deploy. It's getting more difficult. And as we look to the future, we do see trends towards new technologies that might come into place out in time and that may be somewhat of an impediment to people as they think about do I really want to add incremental, significant new wafers to use supply when there may be competing technologies coming. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citi. Your question please. Chris Danely I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian. Anyway, congrats. It feels like we have stepped into a time machine and got off in 1995. Can you just go through your price assumptions for the gross margin guide and then also maybe list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for beyond the May quarter? Ernie Maddock This is Ernie. You and I have been around each other long enough to know you're not going to get an answer to your first question. We don't give underlying pricing assumptions to derive our gross margin guidance. Our gross margin guidance stands on its own for what it is. Relative -- can you repeat the second piece, half, of your question please? Chris Danely Sure, just list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for wait for beyond the make order? Ernie Maddock Yes. So, to do that would be predicting a pricing curve which I also think is troublesome business. As we've talked about, right now, the pricing curve is much flatter than you typically see it and the normal sort of rules of thumb as you look at segments continue to be a little bit inverted as we experience this environment that we're in. So, we have -- we never predict that things go up and to the right for an infinite period of time. You would expect that we would be thinking cautiously as we do our internal business planning which we do. We do apply a very consistent methodology to how we look at things, but we'ren't in a position to tell you when we think that the pricing curve would return to any sort of more normalized perspective that we would have from historical reference. Chris Danely That's fine. Since I whiffed on my first question, maybe you'll allow me another follow-up. You talked about delevering now that cash flow is pretty good. Maybe give us any insight into what would be or what would trigger you to start raising capital or restructure the debt? What would be the options out there? Ernie Maddock I think we're pretty consistent with what we said at our analyst day. We talked about 50% to 75% of a $1.5 billion number. We're on track for that. We'll do that at a time and a pace of our choosing based upon a wide variety of business circumstances, but we do, as I said in my script, remain committed to this and think that it's an important priority for us. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Mark Delaney The first question was a follow-up on just the broader pricing environment. I'm not looking for any absolute number, but just hoping you could help us understand if the contract prices that Micron has seen are still below spot prices. Obviously spot prices rallied pretty significantly, but there's some time maybe before contract can catch up. And just, with what you're guiding at, do you think contract pricing is still below spot in your assumptions? Ernie Maddock Certainly, that's the case today. And don't forget we've also talked in the past about how some of our other segments have contracts of longer duration, so you would get the impact of a renewal of those contracts and, generally speaking, that those renewal -- that renewal pricing environment would continue to be favorable as well. Mark Delaney That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, I know the Company talked a bit in the prepared remarks about certain mix shifts that it has been executing on, doing more in areas like SSDs and moving more towards server DRAM and creation. I was hoping you could help us understand how much more you think you can achieve in those areas through the rest of this fiscal year. Ernie Maddock Sure. So, on the SSD side of the house, as we mentioned I think in response to an earlier question, we think we're at the early days of what we're seeing in terms of penetration on our cloud and enterprise SSDs. I think we do have fairly good momentum and traction in clients in OEM. So that is how we're looking at or thinking about what the opportunities are on the SSD side of the house. And then you also saw an increase in the percentage of the DRAM output that went into the server and cloud segment and we see those continuing to increase here or the demand side of it continuing to increase here, with all of the new data center deployments and a pretty strong demand environment for those. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Baird. Your question please. Tristan Gerra You mentioned that you 3D mix would exceed 75% by year-end in NAND. Could you remind me? Are you decommissioning 2D capacity or is that 3D capacity all incremental? And what kind of longer term ratio should we expect between 3D and 2D beyond this year? Mark Durcan It's a transition primarily from planar to 3D. If it were 100% transition which it's not, that ratio on a square footage basis might be something north of 2-to-1. But we have incremental space as well, so it's not exactly like that. Tristan Gerra Okay. And then could you also remind me, as you transition from 2D to 3D, for the same wafer capacity, what type of bit growth do you get with 64 layer? Mark Durcan From a 2D planar NAND, from a planar NAND wafer to a 64 layer 3D NAND wafer? Tristan Gerra Correct, yes. Mark Durcan It might be -- it's north of 300%, closer to 4X. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone. Your question please. Jagadish Iyer Thanks for taking my question, two questions. First, in terms of the DRAM bit supply, given that you have had Inotera under your belt, I'm curious why your bit shipments were only in the low single digits. And then I have follow-up. Ernie Maddock Inotera has always been part of our output and measured in our bit shipments, so the transaction -- the formal closing of the transaction really did not represent an incremental addition to the Company's bit supply. Jagadish Iyer Okay, fair enough. Then on the pricing environment for DRAM, what contributed to the 21% increase? Was there any specific subsegment of DRAM that you saw strength? And do you think that this is a one-time event or how should we think about it? I know you would not give more clarity on pricing going forward, but any color specifically on the 21% increase would be helpful. Ernie Maddock We've all been able to read every week about what's happened to DRAM exchange with respect to spot pricing and certainly that trend as influenced every single other segment. So I think, as Mark mentioned in his script, while last quarter the pricing was more focused around what was happening in the client and OEM markets, this quarter, the impact of that having extended over time and consistent with our earlier comments been subject to some of these contract renewals, are starting to manifest themselves across mobile, across enterprise and really the full breadth of the DRAM product portfolio. Operator Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please. John Pitzer Ernie, I know you're not going to talk about kind of forward pricing assumptions in the May guide, but when you look at the May guide and just how significantly above investor expectations it were, I was wondering if you could help us quantify or qualify a little bit to what extent is this being driven by cyclical leverage, like-for-like pricing, versus things that might have a little bit more longevity like your ability to mix into better end markets or your ability to cost-down or just operational efficiencies. And as you answer the question, I'd be curious just to see your view on whether or not you believe you are starting to close that cost cap with some of your peers out there. Ernie Maddock I think, one, to reiterate something we said earlier, but it is very important, we're really consistent quarter to quarter with how we think about our guidance. So there was no dramatic change from a methodology point of view in that. And I think, John, you actually hit on many of the points that are contributing to that nice uptick in margin. So, first, we do have a broad profile and that allows us to move between segments and really maximize the opportunity between those segments. And as you saw this quarter, we're tilting more to cloud and enterprise which we think represents some good, long term opportunity for the Company. We have system-level solutions that utilize the breadth of the Company's product portfolio in things like MCPs and builds on the capabilities of the Company with things like SSDs. You have a better technology execution or strong technology execution, in terms of where we have been in the past, so the gap is closing. We've been consistently telling you that we think it will close and we're going to continue to make progress in that regard. And then you do have leverage that comes from the scale that we have achieved over the course of the last two or three years as we've made these technology transitions. So, really, I think, to the point you are making, this is not only about pricing. It's about pricing and everything else that we've been working on collectively as a team to deliver broad operational capability into all of our end markets. John Pitzer Then maybe as my follow-up, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about having meaningful 1X volume by the end of this fiscal year. I'm wondering if you could quantify what you mean by meaningful. And I guess, from my perspective, it seems like a little bit earlier than I would have expected. Is that true? And if so, are you just finding it an easier ramp? And can you remind us of sort of the cost-downs you expect to get with the move to 1X? Mark Durcan I don't want to put too much specificity around exactly where we will end up at the end of the year on a bit mix, but I will tell you that you will recall, at the analyst day, we shared with you that we believe we were making very good progress on our 1X nanometer yield ramp at that time and that continues to go really very smoothly with a good progress in both Taiwan and Japan. So, we're very happy with the way it's going and we will continue to monitor that and drive it appropriately. I will say also that there's a pretty good suite of products that penetrate a number of different end market segments and those qualifications are going well and those products are looking very robust. And I'm happy with the way that's coming along. From a cost perspective, I think greater than 20% is what we've indicated in the past and that's probably a good place to leave it for now. At the end of the day, it will depend on mix. We've got a lot of different products going in a lot of different segments. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Joe Moore I'm wondering if you could touch on the NAND prices being down sequentially. I was little surprised to see that relative to what we're hearing. Mark Durcan It's primarily around mix. We're shipping a lot of high density TLC 3D product versus, previously, we had some lower density products hanging out in some pretty small niches as our volume has gone up and as we've begun to drive more towards some of these higher density cloud type applications. We're doing more those types of products and all of the pricing is down. They are driving some pretty significant cost improvements for us as well. And so, from a margin perspective, that's definitely where we want to be moving through time here. Joe Moore Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then your inventory picked up a little bit and I was surprised to see that because I know how much customers want product. Can you just talk about, that and did that sort of -- is that the ramp in NAND or what are we seeing there? Ernie Maddock Consistent with sort of the ambitious plans we have around the SSD market, I would say the majority of that was attributable to that build-up. And in addition to that, if you are doing a quarter-on quarter compare, Inotera on the DRAM side was not considered part of the inventory in the December quarter -- or sorry, in the prior quarter -- whereas it's currently part of our inventory. So that was really a significant part of the increase on the DRAM side. So, it's those two things. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your question please. Unidentified Analyst This is Kristen Shak [ph] in for Romit Shah. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the great quarter, guys. My first question, you gave some helpful commentary about the bit growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 versus the first half of fiscal 2017. I was just wondering if you could give some color about how we should think about the cost declines for the second half versus the first half. I'm not looking for anything, really concrete numbers, just anything qualitative would be great. Ernie Maddock I think the best way I would guide you do there is we have actually provided what we thought was going to be a fiscal year -- a fiscal year cost-down target for both technologies and we've now given you all of the pieces that you need to compute that. So, that's how I would guide you to come up with your estimate of what you think our cost-downs are going to be. Unidentified Analyst And then we're still seeing a lot of the spec-ing uptrends for Chinese smartphones, especially in DRAM. With the strong pricing that we've seen in DRAM over the past few months, do you see that trend changing or do you see that trend continuing? Any color there would be great. Mark Durcan Sorry, the question around Chinese phones was content or -- Unidentified Analyst Yes, content, mainly in DRAM content. Mark Durcan We continue to see, in the lower-end and midtier phones, we continue to see pretty good content growth. Yes, there is more of a concern at the high end in terms of what eventually will people stop taking densities up there, but even at the high end, I think we anticipate some continued growth with 6 to 8 gigabits at the top. But in the lower-tier and mid-tier smartphones, we still see pretty robust growth and so, in aggregate, when we look at mobile, we're thinking in terms of 30% bit growth there this year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your question please. David Ryzhik This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just two if I can. Just how can we think about contract discussions with customers? Are you seeing more long term type of duration negotiations? And I just had a quick follow-up. Thanks. Mark Durcan It's very different segment to segment, customer to customer. So, I wouldn't say that there is a huge sea change, although clearly there are some customers in this kind of environment that are interested in lengthier relationships. David Ryzhik Great. And for 3D NAND, any update on timing of QLC introduction and would you introduce it at the 64 layer density? Thanks. Mark Durcan Yes, we're not going to be too specific yet about our QLC plans, but we will confirm that we're happy with the way that technology is progressing. And that's probably all we've got to say for now. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Robert Mertens of Needham & Company. Your question please. Robert Mertens Just two quick questions on behalf of Raji Gill. You spoke a little bit towards the yields with 3D NAND on the 32 layer. Could you just talk a little bit about your competitive advantage going forward on the 3D NAND side and then also just give a little bit more color on your gross margin trajectory and how we should think about that throughout the year? Thank you. Mark Durcan We're not going to give you gross margins, as Ernie already indicated unfortunately. We're just not going to go there. But relative to our competitive position on 3D NAND, we feel very good about it. I would direct you back to the comments we made in the slides we showed at the analyst conference a couple of months ago. We're very happy with our 32 layer yields. We're very happy with how we're progressing on our 64 layer spec. And we think we're in the lead position relative to our cost effectiveness and our density and our ability to deliver products at all the [indiscernible]. Operator Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question please. C.J. Muse Can you guys -- first question -- update us on your thoughts in terms of DRAM supply demand for this year? And are we to assume that tightening shortages should continue through the calendar year? And then assuming the wafers that you already have baked into that 15% to 20% supply, if we don't see new wafers next year and we just think about a world that shrinks, how should we think about supply into calendar 2018? Mark Durcan We really don't have an update for you. It's still, in our view, it's 15% to 20% supply growth this year, could actually be less than that if there's less new wafers than we have in our plan. Demand is still 20% plus. Next year, we would be in the teens if we don't get the new wafers. C.J. Muse Great. And as a follow-up, you talked about second-half DRAM bits being 10% higher than first-half. I'm assuming that's production. Can you hit that on a sales basis or should we assume slightly less, given the timing of 1X? Ernie Maddock No, that was representative of what we think will ultimately be reflected in our financial statements. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your question please. Stephen Chin I had a question on, first of all, for the NAND flash business with mobile being only 20% of the sales there. I was wondering. Just given the relatively low exposure there currently relative to the overall market, is that implying that, for the second half of the year, you are expecting you'll see a lot of seasonality that's helping to drive some of the second-half 30% half-on-half growth? Ernie Maddock Again, the 30% was a function of our output and we would direct that output into the various outlets that we have, whether it be the SSD business, the mobile business, etc. So, we will sort of wait and see how that plays out here as we get to the back half of the year. Stephen Chin Okay, that's fair. As my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin guidance, can you talk a bit about the implied cost reductions on both DRAM and NAND flash for this quarter's guidance? Just given the relatively high output for your 20 nanometer DRAM and also I guess the ramping nature of 32 layer 3D, is there still a lot of cost reduction in the current quarter from both of those technologies? Ernie Maddock Again, I'd kind of refer you back to the full-year guidance that we provided which was rather specific. We have now completed two quarters of that year and we've given you a view of the back-half bit growth. So I think we've given you all the building blocks that you need to derive a gross margin profile and that's not something that we typically share. And operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator We have a question from Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Newman I have a question around your supply growth, given there is such strong pricing out there in the market. So, firstly, can you talk about what the underlying wafer capacity trend is doing for Micron in both DRAM and NAND this year? And related to that, how much flexibility, given how strong pricing is today, how much flexibility does Micron have to add more either this calendar year or next year? I'm not saying that you will. Just how much flexibility do you have to add more if, for whatever economic means reasons, you could make the calculation that it does make sense to add more? Thanks. Mark Durcan I think the best way -- as best as we going to characterize wafers would be to say it's pretty stable. We're very focused on technology transitions. We're not focused on adding more supply, so we're just utilizing the existing capacity and transitioning it through advanced nodes. We do have white space in both our Fab 16 in Taichung as well as Fab 10X, but we're not planning any capacity additions this year. And if we were to decide we wanted to which I think is unlikely, for us, as for our competitors, there is significant leadtime at the moment for equipment and it would take quite a while to bring that on in the marketplace. Mark Newman Is it possible to quantify how much it would be in terms of wafers? Again, not saying you're going to add it, but just how much capacity you have the ability -- and how much do you have the ability to add in both DRAM and NAND? Mark Durcan No and, again, it's kind of moot. So, thanks for the questions. Ernie Maddock This is Ernie. Before we close, I wanted to share with everyone that Ivan is going to be transitioning out of his IR role into another role here at Micron and I wanted to personally express my appreciation to him for his support of the Company during his tenure in IR, including bringing me up to speed which was quite challenging, I'm sure. We will miss him very, very much. We're in the process of determining how best to fill his shoes, but in the interim, Liz Morali will be the primary IR contact point. And with that, we will say thanks again for your participation and we'll talk to you next quarter. Mark Durcan Thank you everyone. Operator Thank you.

Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your question please.  Harlan Sur Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the solid quarterly execution and strong outlook. Despite the very optimistic and positive pricing environment, there's been some growing concern around the notion of demand destruction given the strong pricing environment and availability of both DRAM and NAND to a point where I think there is a view forming that there's potential for PC and server destocking on the DRAM side, less DRAM per box, on the mobile side, less DRAM per smartphone and on the NAND side, less uptake of SSDs and more uptake of HDDs. I guess the question is do you see this happening and how does it impact the dynamics of the supply-demand environment going forward? Mark Durcan This is Mark. To date, we've seen no indication of that at all really in any segment. It's true that, in cycles, from time to time, that does happen late in a cycle, but, today, we see continued strong bit growth across almost every end market segment and no real indication of that occurring anywhere, in particular not in specialty, not in mobile, certainly not in the enterprise and server area. Harlan Sur Great, thank you for that. And then solid results in the NAND business with your margins up I think it's 800 basis points in the quarter. As we think about the cost curve on a go-forward basis and the ramp of your 64 layer 3D, can you just give us an idea on how your yields and performance of the products are doing either relative to your internal targets or relative to the same time last year in the ramp of your 32 layer products? Mark Durcan This is Mark. A year ago, Harlan, I can't catch that I even recall where we were on 3D NAND yields, but I will tell you we're very happy with where they are for 32 layer MLC and TLC. And again, TLC is the big piece of that. We're where we thought we ought to be and at very mature yields. 64 layer, as we talked about, is a material piece of our bid output late in the year and we're very happy with the progress we're making there and the yields we're seeing on that technology as well. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please. Steven Fox Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two questions from me. First of all, if you could talk a little bit more color around this -- I believe you talked about bit growth of about 30% half-over-half. Maybe qualify or quantify as much as you want to the growth drivers, how much from SSDs versus mobile, etc. And then secondly, can you talk a little bit about the auto growth in the quarter and what's driving that and how that looks into the second half as well and what's the key contributors there? Thank you. Mark Durcan Sure. So relative to bit growth with NAND, that was more statement around what our output profile is going to look like. And of course, we will deploy that output to the end markets that we feel will provide the best opportunity for the Company here as we see the back half of the year unfold. Relative to automotive, it's very similar to what we've been consistently talking about -- driver assist systems, infotainment, a lot of what is required as we move up that autonomous driving food chain and as what are today considered to be advanced features in automotive, the automotive business penetrates mid and lower end cars. So that -- there's nothing particularly unique about what continues to drive that. It's the same unfolding story relative to memory deployment in the automotive sector. Ernie Maddock I think, if the question is do we participate in all of the various pieces of automotive end demand, the answer is yes. We're in the drivetrain. We're in the ADAS systems. We're in the infotainment systems and continue to maintain strong market share in all those pieces. Steven Fox Thanks very much for that. Just real quick on the first comments, on the -- just as it applies to cloud SSDs, your own cloud SSDs that you're launching, can you give a little more color on how broadly we should see those deployed maybe during the fall of this year? Mark Durcan Yes. I think you're going to see them very broadly deployed. As we noted, the initial uptakes of that SSD was announced in the early part of December of last year. The uptake has been very strong and we continue to see that growing at a significant rate here as we progress through the calendar year, along with some new features. We have a 5100 SATA drive with PCIE and NVMe coming soon as well, so we think that will help with the proliferation and the expansion of the demand. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen. Your question please. Timothy Arcuri Thank you very much. I guess, Mark, I'm just looking at the guidance and you guys are guiding to a quarterly earnings number that's like 50% higher than you guys did in the last cycle, yet your stock is still $5.00 below where it peaked last time. And I know there are some changes in the cap structure and whatnot. But I guess the question really is what's the concern you hear from investors when you've been out there on the conference circuit this quarter? Are people worried about the sustainability of the cycle and like what is the big concern from your point of you and is that valid? Mark Durcan It's a good question. I think people are looking at the cycle and wondering are we getting long in the tooth, etc.? We start to read stuff about that. We're not seeing that at all. As mentioned, we're not seeing -- really what's driving this cycle when you think about it is broad-based demand across multiple market segments and in particular it's content growth in all of those segments as opposed to particularly strong unit growth in one segment or the other. And so as we look at the market today, it looks very robust from an end market demand and maybe much broader and less unit-driven than we've seen in the past. We also see that the supply, as best we can tell, seems in control relative to demand. And I think, if you think about this cycle versus last cycle, what you saw -- what you saw last cycle was a big chunk of supply come off with the Hynix fire and the reaction with more supply to replace it and so maybe a little less stability than we're seeing this time around. So that's all on the DRAM side. On the NAND side, this HDD replacement cycle is big. We're well into it in client. It's not going to stop in the cloud and enterprise. Mobile storage demand continues to accelerate. And so, again, it's broad-based content growth in all of those end applications and it's supply on the NAND side that's relatively capital-intensive to put in place with complex technology. And so there, again, that all seems like it's in pretty good shape. Timothy Arcuri Okay. I guess just to follow onto that, so it looks like, based upon the guidance, that the gross margin in DRAM is going to be in excess of 50%. Usually, that doesn't last very long and people are obviously worried about Samsung adding a bunch of wafers. Why would that not happen this time? Based upon what you know, why would that not happen? And sort of what's your -- obviously, they have to add some wafers. But what's your base assumption for what the competition will do sort of in terms of bit growth this year? Thanks. Mark Durcan Again, I think the last cycle was a little different with that instability in supply created by the Hynix fire. I don't know why they would intentionally repeat the mistake from last cycle. They probably are enjoying making good margins. And our view is we just go out and we look at what information is available relative to all the various additions people are making and might be making and what the timeframe that might occur in and then we give you -- you know, what we think that bit growth looks like. And that looks like it's probably actually -- Samsung is actually probably on the low end over the next couple of years relative to what's going on in the industry as a whole. And the industry as a whole is probably a little bit south of where we think demand growth is. So, could it happen? Yes. Why would it happen? I can't forecast that for you. Ernie Maddock This is Ernie. I think the important thing to bear in mind is, in the estimates that we've provided for supply growth this year of 15% to 20%, you would have to add some wafers to get into that range. Absent those wafer additions, you would be below the low end of that range, based on everything that we know. So, it is not a surprise that wafers are being added, given the forecast that we believe exists from the supply side. Mark Durcan And again, the other thing to keep in mind here is there are some natural impediments. The technology is getting more expensive to deploy. It's getting more difficult. And as we look to the future, we do see trends towards new technologies that might come into place out in time and that may be somewhat of an impediment to people as they think about do I really want to add incremental, significant new wafers to use supply when there may be competing technologies coming. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citi. Your question please. Chris Danely I didn't know I went from Jewish to Italian. Anyway, congrats. It feels like we have stepped into a time machine and got off in 1995. Can you just go through your price assumptions for the gross margin guide and then also maybe list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for beyond the May quarter? Ernie Maddock This is Ernie. You and I have been around each other long enough to know you're not going to get an answer to your first question. We don't give underlying pricing assumptions to derive our gross margin guidance. Our gross margin guidance stands on its own for what it is. Relative -- can you repeat the second piece, half, of your question please? Chris Danely Sure, just list the gross margin drivers in order of importance for wait for beyond the make order? Ernie Maddock Yes. So, to do that would be predicting a pricing curve which I also think is troublesome business. As we've talked about, right now, the pricing curve is much flatter than you typically see it and the normal sort of rules of thumb as you look at segments continue to be a little bit inverted as we experience this environment that we're in. So, we have -- we never predict that things go up and to the right for an infinite period of time. You would expect that we would be thinking cautiously as we do our internal business planning which we do. We do apply a very consistent methodology to how we look at things, but we'ren't in a position to tell you when we think that the pricing curve would return to any sort of more normalized perspective that we would have from historical reference. Chris Danely That's fine. Since I whiffed on my first question, maybe you'll allow me another follow-up. You talked about delevering now that cash flow is pretty good. Maybe give us any insight into what would be or what would trigger you to start raising capital or restructure the debt? What would be the options out there? Ernie Maddock I think we're pretty consistent with what we said at our analyst day. We talked about 50% to 75% of a $1.5 billion number. We're on track for that. We'll do that at a time and a pace of our choosing based upon a wide variety of business circumstances, but we do, as I said in my script, remain committed to this and think that it's an important priority for us. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Mark Delaney The first question was a follow-up on just the broader pricing environment. I'm not looking for any absolute number, but just hoping you could help us understand if the contract prices that Micron has seen are still below spot prices. Obviously spot prices rallied pretty significantly, but there's some time maybe before contract can catch up. And just, with what you're guiding at, do you think contract pricing is still below spot in your assumptions? Ernie Maddock Certainly, that's the case today. And don't forget we've also talked in the past about how some of our other segments have contracts of longer duration, so you would get the impact of a renewal of those contracts and, generally speaking, that those renewal -- that renewal pricing environment would continue to be favorable as well. Mark Delaney That's helpful. And then for a follow-up question, I know the Company talked a bit in the prepared remarks about certain mix shifts that it has been executing on, doing more in areas like SSDs and moving more towards server DRAM and creation. I was hoping you could help us understand how much more you think you can achieve in those areas through the rest of this fiscal year. Ernie Maddock Sure. So, on the SSD side of the house, as we mentioned I think in response to an earlier question, we think we're at the early days of what we're seeing in terms of penetration on our cloud and enterprise SSDs. I think we do have fairly good momentum and traction in clients in OEM. So that is how we're looking at or thinking about what the opportunities are on the SSD side of the house. And then you also saw an increase in the percentage of the DRAM output that went into the server and cloud segment and we see those continuing to increase here or the demand side of it continuing to increase here, with all of the new data center deployments and a pretty strong demand environment for those. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Baird. Your question please. Tristan Gerra You mentioned that you 3D mix would exceed 75% by year-end in NAND. Could you remind me? Are you decommissioning 2D capacity or is that 3D capacity all incremental? And what kind of longer term ratio should we expect between 3D and 2D beyond this year? Mark Durcan It's a transition primarily from planar to 3D. If it were 100% transition which it's not, that ratio on a square footage basis might be something north of 2-to-1. But we have incremental space as well, so it's not exactly like that. Tristan Gerra Okay. And then could you also remind me, as you transition from 2D to 3D, for the same wafer capacity, what type of bit growth do you get with 64 layer? Mark Durcan From a 2D planar NAND, from a planar NAND wafer to a 64 layer 3D NAND wafer? Tristan Gerra Correct, yes. Mark Durcan It might be -- it's north of 300%, closer to 4X. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Jagadish Iyer of Summit Redstone. Your question please. Jagadish Iyer Thanks for taking my question, two questions. First, in terms of the DRAM bit supply, given that you have had Inotera under your belt, I'm curious why your bit shipments were only in the low single digits. And then I have follow-up. Ernie Maddock Inotera has always been part of our output and measured in our bit shipments, so the transaction -- the formal closing of the transaction really did not represent an incremental addition to the Company's bit supply. Jagadish Iyer Okay, fair enough. Then on the pricing environment for DRAM, what contributed to the 21% increase? Was there any specific subsegment of DRAM that you saw strength? And do you think that this is a one-time event or how should we think about it? I know you would not give more clarity on pricing going forward, but any color specifically on the 21% increase would be helpful. Ernie Maddock We've all been able to read every week about what's happened to DRAM exchange with respect to spot pricing and certainly that trend as influenced every single other segment. So I think, as Mark mentioned in his script, while last quarter the pricing was more focused around what was happening in the client and OEM markets, this quarter, the impact of that having extended over time and consistent with our earlier comments been subject to some of these contract renewals, are starting to manifest themselves across mobile, across enterprise and really the full breadth of the DRAM product portfolio. Operator Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your question please. John Pitzer Ernie, I know you're not going to talk about kind of forward pricing assumptions in the May guide, but when you look at the May guide and just how significantly above investor expectations it were, I was wondering if you could help us quantify or qualify a little bit to what extent is this being driven by cyclical leverage, like-for-like pricing, versus things that might have a little bit more longevity like your ability to mix into better end markets or your ability to cost-down or just operational efficiencies. And as you answer the question, I'd be curious just to see your view on whether or not you believe you are starting to close that cost cap with some of your peers out there. Ernie Maddock I think, one, to reiterate something we said earlier, but it is very important, we're really consistent quarter to quarter with how we think about our guidance. So there was no dramatic change from a methodology point of view in that. And I think, John, you actually hit on many of the points that are contributing to that nice uptick in margin. So, first, we do have a broad profile and that allows us to move between segments and really maximize the opportunity between those segments. And as you saw this quarter, we're tilting more to cloud and enterprise which we think represents some good, long term opportunity for the Company. We have system-level solutions that utilize the breadth of the Company's product portfolio in things like MCPs and builds on the capabilities of the Company with things like SSDs. You have a better technology execution or strong technology execution, in terms of where we have been in the past, so the gap is closing. We've been consistently telling you that we think it will close and we're going to continue to make progress in that regard. And then you do have leverage that comes from the scale that we have achieved over the course of the last two or three years as we've made these technology transitions. So, really, I think, to the point you are making, this is not only about pricing. It's about pricing and everything else that we've been working on collectively as a team to deliver broad operational capability into all of our end markets. John Pitzer Then maybe as my follow-up, Mark, in your prepared comments, you talked about having meaningful 1X volume by the end of this fiscal year. I'm wondering if you could quantify what you mean by meaningful. And I guess, from my perspective, it seems like a little bit earlier than I would have expected. Is that true? And if so, are you just finding it an easier ramp? And can you remind us of sort of the cost-downs you expect to get with the move to 1X? Mark Durcan I don't want to put too much specificity around exactly where we will end up at the end of the year on a bit mix, but I will tell you that you will recall, at the analyst day, we shared with you that we believe we were making very good progress on our 1X nanometer yield ramp at that time and that continues to go really very smoothly with a good progress in both Taiwan and Japan. So, we're very happy with the way it's going and we will continue to monitor that and drive it appropriately. I will say also that there's a pretty good suite of products that penetrate a number of different end market segments and those qualifications are going well and those products are looking very robust. And I'm happy with the way that's coming along. From a cost perspective, I think greater than 20% is what we've indicated in the past and that's probably a good place to leave it for now. At the end of the day, it will depend on mix. We've got a lot of different products going in a lot of different segments. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please. Joe Moore I'm wondering if you could touch on the NAND prices being down sequentially. I was little surprised to see that relative to what we're hearing. Mark Durcan It's primarily around mix. We're shipping a lot of high density TLC 3D product versus, previously, we had some lower density products hanging out in some pretty small niches as our volume has gone up and as we've begun to drive more towards some of these higher density cloud type applications. We're doing more those types of products and all of the pricing is down. They are driving some pretty significant cost improvements for us as well. And so, from a margin perspective, that's definitely where we want to be moving through time here. Joe Moore Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then your inventory picked up a little bit and I was surprised to see that because I know how much customers want product. Can you just talk about, that and did that sort of -- is that the ramp in NAND or what are we seeing there? Ernie Maddock Consistent with sort of the ambitious plans we have around the SSD market, I would say the majority of that was attributable to that build-up. And in addition to that, if you are doing a quarter-on quarter compare, Inotera on the DRAM side was not considered part of the inventory in the December quarter -- or sorry, in the prior quarter -- whereas it's currently part of our inventory. So that was really a significant part of the increase on the DRAM side. So, it's those two things. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your question please. Unidentified Analyst This is Kristen Shak [ph] in for Romit Shah. Thanks for letting me ask a question and congrats on the great quarter, guys. My first question, you gave some helpful commentary about the bit growth for the second half of fiscal 2017 versus the first half of fiscal 2017. I was just wondering if you could give some color about how we should think about the cost declines for the second half versus the first half. I'm not looking for anything, really concrete numbers, just anything qualitative would be great. Ernie Maddock I think the best way I would guide you do there is we have actually provided what we thought was going to be a fiscal year -- a fiscal year cost-down target for both technologies and we've now given you all of the pieces that you need to compute that. So, that's how I would guide you to come up with your estimate of what you think our cost-downs are going to be. Unidentified Analyst And then we're still seeing a lot of the spec-ing uptrends for Chinese smartphones, especially in DRAM. With the strong pricing that we've seen in DRAM over the past few months, do you see that trend changing or do you see that trend continuing? Any color there would be great. Mark Durcan Sorry, the question around Chinese phones was content or -- Unidentified Analyst Yes, content, mainly in DRAM content. Mark Durcan We continue to see, in the lower-end and midtier phones, we continue to see pretty good content growth. Yes, there is more of a concern at the high end in terms of what eventually will people stop taking densities up there, but even at the high end, I think we anticipate some continued growth with 6 to 8 gigabits at the top. But in the lower-tier and mid-tier smartphones, we still see pretty robust growth and so, in aggregate, when we look at mobile, we're thinking in terms of 30% bit growth there this year. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your question please. David Ryzhik This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Just two if I can. Just how can we think about contract discussions with customers? Are you seeing more long term type of duration negotiations? And I just had a quick follow-up. Thanks. Mark Durcan It's very different segment to segment, customer to customer. So, I wouldn't say that there is a huge sea change, although clearly there are some customers in this kind of environment that are interested in lengthier relationships. David Ryzhik Great. And for 3D NAND, any update on timing of QLC introduction and would you introduce it at the 64 layer density? Thanks. Mark Durcan Yes, we're not going to be too specific yet about our QLC plans, but we will confirm that we're happy with the way that technology is progressing. And that's probably all we've got to say for now. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Robert Mertens of Needham & Company. Your question please. Robert Mertens Just two quick questions on behalf of Raji Gill. You spoke a little bit towards the yields with 3D NAND on the 32 layer. Could you just talk a little bit about your competitive advantage going forward on the 3D NAND side and then also just give a little bit more color on your gross margin trajectory and how we should think about that throughout the year? Thank you. Mark Durcan We're not going to give you gross margins, as Ernie already indicated unfortunately. We're just not going to go there. But relative to our competitive position on 3D NAND, we feel very good about it. I would direct you back to the comments we made in the slides we showed at the analyst conference a couple of months ago. We're very happy with our 32 layer yields. We're very happy with how we're progressing on our 64 layer spec. And we think we're in the lead position relative to our cost effectiveness and our density and our ability to deliver products at all the [indiscernible]. Operator Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your question please. C.J. Muse Can you guys -- first question -- update us on your thoughts in terms of DRAM supply demand for this year? And are we to assume that tightening shortages should continue through the calendar year? And then assuming the wafers that you already have baked into that 15% to 20% supply, if we don't see new wafers next year and we just think about a world that shrinks, how should we think about supply into calendar 2018? Mark Durcan We really don't have an update for you. It's still, in our view, it's 15% to 20% supply growth this year, could actually be less than that if there's less new wafers than we have in our plan. Demand is still 20% plus. Next year, we would be in the teens if we don't get the new wafers. C.J. Muse Great. And as a follow-up, you talked about second-half DRAM bits being 10% higher than first-half. I'm assuming that's production. Can you hit that on a sales basis or should we assume slightly less, given the timing of 1X? Ernie Maddock No, that was representative of what we think will ultimately be reflected in our financial statements. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Chin of UBS. Your question please. Stephen Chin I had a question on, first of all, for the NAND flash business with mobile being only 20% of the sales there. I was wondering. Just given the relatively low exposure there currently relative to the overall market, is that implying that, for the second half of the year, you are expecting you'll see a lot of seasonality that's helping to drive some of the second-half 30% half-on-half growth? Ernie Maddock Again, the 30% was a function of our output and we would direct that output into the various outlets that we have, whether it be the SSD business, the mobile business, etc. So, we will sort of wait and see how that plays out here as we get to the back half of the year. Stephen Chin Okay, that's fair. As my follow-up, in terms of the gross margin guidance, can you talk a bit about the implied cost reductions on both DRAM and NAND flash for this quarter's guidance? Just given the relatively high output for your 20 nanometer DRAM and also I guess the ramping nature of 32 layer 3D, is there still a lot of cost reduction in the current quarter from both of those technologies? Ernie Maddock Again, I'd kind of refer you back to the full-year guidance that we provided which was rather specific. We have now completed two quarters of that year and we've given you a view of the back-half bit growth. So I think we've given you all the building blocks that you need to derive a gross margin profile and that's not something that we typically share. And operator, I think we have time for one more question. Operator We have a question from Mark Newman of Bernstein. Your line is open. Mark Newman I have a question around your supply growth, given there is such strong pricing out there in the market. So, firstly, can you talk about what the underlying wafer capacity trend is doing for Micron in both DRAM and NAND this year? And related to that, how much flexibility, given how strong pricing is today, how much flexibility does Micron have to add more either this calendar year or next year? I'm not saying that you will. Just how much flexibility do you have to add more if, for whatever economic means reasons, you could make the calculation that it does make sense to add more? Thanks. Mark Durcan I think the best way -- as best as we going to characterize wafers would be to say it's pretty stable. We're very focused on technology transitions. We're not focused on adding more supply, so we're just utilizing the existing capacity and transitioning it through advanced nodes. We do have white space in both our Fab 16 in Taichung as well as Fab 10X, but we're not planning any capacity additions this year. And if we were to decide we wanted to which I think is unlikely, for us, as for our competitors, there is significant leadtime at the moment for equipment and it would take quite a while to bring that on in the marketplace. Mark Newman Is it possible to quantify how much it would be in terms of wafers? Again, not saying you're going to add it, but just how much capacity you have the ability -- and how much do you have the ability to add in both DRAM and NAND? Mark Durcan No and, again, it's kind of moot. So, thanks for the questions. Ernie Maddock This is Ernie. Before we close, I wanted to share with everyone that Ivan is going to be transitioning out of his IR role into another role here at Micron and I wanted to personally express my appreciation to him for his support of the Company during his tenure in IR, including bringing me up to speed which was quite challenging, I'm sure. We will miss him very, very much. We're in the process of determining how best to fill his shoes, but in the interim, Liz Morali will be the primary IR contact point. And with that, we will say thanks again for your participation and we'll talk to you next quarter. Mark Durcan Thank you everyone. Operator Thank you.

My name is Frederica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the 2016 Year-End Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Bradley Joseph, Vice President of Global Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin your conference. Bradley Joseph Thank you very much. Good afternoon and welcome to Perrigo's calendar year 2016 preliminary unaudited earnings conference call. I hope you all have had a chance to review the press releases we issued early this morning. Copies of the releases are available on our website, as is the slide presentation for this call. Leading today's call are John Hendrickson, Perrigo's Chief Executive Officer, and Ron Winowiecki, Perrigo's acting Chief Financial Officer. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, participants will make certain forward-looking statements. Please refer to the important information for investors and shareholders and Safe Harbor language regarding these statements in our press releases issued this afternoon. In addition, in the appendix for today's presentation, we have provided reconciliations for all non-GAAP financial measures presented. Please note that today we'll be discussing certain preliminary unaudited calendar year 2016 financial results and initial calendar year 2017 guidance. However, we cannot assure you that our audited 2016 results or initial 2017 guidance will not be materially different. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to John Hendrickson. John Hendrickson Thank you, Brad and welcome everyone to Perrigo's calendar year 2016 preliminary earnings call. Before discussing our performance, I want to comment on the internal transition we announced in our press releases earlier today. Effective immediately, Ron Winowiecki Senior Vice President of Business Finance will assume the role of Acting Chief Financial Officer following the departure of Judy Brown, Executive Vice President of Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. Judy is leaving Perrigo to take a position with another company in the pharmaceutical industry beginning on April 1, 2017. We thank her for her contributions, and wish her best in her future endeavors. As our acting CFO, Ron brings almost three decades of financial and accounting experience to his position. He has the industry knowledge and technical expertise to successfully lead our finance team. I worked closely with Ron during much of his tenure at Perrigo, and I can test to his leadership skills, financial expertise, and strategic acumen. I believe that he is the right person to take on this role, as we conduct a thorough search for a permanent CFO, which will include Ron as a key candidate. I have full confidence in Ron, and look forward to working with him as our CFO. As you've likely seen in our press release earlier today, we filed the Form 10b–25 notification of late filing with the SEC regarding our Annual Report on Form 10K for the period ended December 31, 2016. We currently expect to file our Form 10-K on or before March 16, 2017. Ron will provide you more detail regarding this matter shortly, but I would like to comment upfront that while this delay is unfortunate, we remain committed to providing timely, accurate and transparent communication to all of our stakeholders. Now I want to talk about our business. I will begin by providing an update on the progress we have made against our strategic and operational action plan and I laid out in my initial 30 days. Next, I will provide perspective on our preliminary calendar year 2016 results, as well as my top priorities for 2017. Ron will then provide the detail regarding our delayed 10-K filing, the preliminary calendar year financial results and provide our initial 2017 guidance. I will then conclude with final comments before taking your questions. Turning to slide six; you can see that we continue to make progress on our action plan to create value which is underpinned by our strategic portfolio review. I have a number of updates that I would like to share with you today. First, corporate governance continues to be a priority for the Perrigo Board of Directors. On February 7, we announced the appointment of three highly qualified and experienced professionals to the Board. I will discuss these individuals in more detail on next slide as we look forward to leveraging their industry expertise. Second, as you likely saw in a separate press release we issued this afternoon, Perrigo has announced an arrangement to sell the rights to Tysabri Royalty Stream to an affiliate of Royalty Pharma, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment. Further after extensive review, Perrigo's Board of Directors has approved a review of strategic alternatives for our active pharmaceutical ingredient business based in Israel. We believe a potential divestiture of this business allows Perrigo to give greater focus to our consumer facing OTC and Rx businesses. Third, we previously stated that we are conducting a review to optimize our cost structure in order to better align expenses with our current and future market dynamics. Today, we are announcing a restructuring program that is expected to yield greater than $130 million in savings per annum by mid-2018. This is in addition to the strong contribution that our supply chain organization continues to generate for both our North America and International segments. Again, I'll provide details in just a few minutes. Fourth, our Consumer Healthcare International profitability improvement program, which I will discuss in a moment includes three components; exiting unprofitable businesses, structural enhancement, and launching new products all of which remain core to our value proposition. And lastly, we continue to make progress on several other initiatives including the enhanced review of our Rx business. Turning to slide seven; Perrigo has recently added five new highly qualified and experienced directors to our Board reinforcing our commitment to bringing fresh perspectives and new energy to the Board and Leadership. I would like to formally welcome Jeff Smith, CEO and CIO Starboard Value LP; Brad Alford, former Chairman and CEO of Nestle USA and Jeff Kindler the CEO of Centrexion and former Chairman and CEO of Pfizer to our Board. These appointments along with our recent additions of Geoff Parker and Ted Samuels will be beneficial for Perrigo and its shareholders as these individuals bring a strong mix of healthcare, consumer, and investor experience that align with Perrigo's unique business model. Further, we will continue to seek out fresh perspectives that will contribute to Perrigo's mission of providing quality affordable healthcare products and expect to appoint two additional Board members, who will be recommended by Starboard and ultimately approved by the Board. Within the past few weeks, our new directors have been working diligently to master the company's business objectives, and curb market dynamics. It's clear from our recent discussions, that all of our board members understand the strength of our unique business model including Perrigo's highly valuable portfolio businesses. The Board continues its strategic portfolio review including an enhanced review the Rx business; as always, I promise to keep you updated as we make progress. Turning to slide eight; I'll now discuss the agreement to sell the Tysabri Royalty Stream to Royalty Pharma for up to $2.85 billion, which consists of $2.2 billion in cash and up to $650 million in royalties earned if net sales of Tysabri meet specific threshold in 2018 and 2020. This sale enabled Perrigo to continue to focus on our other businesses while de-levering the balance sheet creating more flexibility for growth. We are committed to be a good steward of capital and maintain investment-grade status as one of our long-term status objectives. Turning to slide nine; quality continues to be the cornerstone of our organization and our customers rely on Perrigo to manufacture safe and effective products that provide real value to consumers. We remain focused on maintaining our high standard amid increasing volume demands for our products. At this time, while I believe Perrigo has maintained a lean cost base there are always ways to be more efficient. In order to help offset significant industry price challenges, we have initiated a cost optimization strategy across the company. The core thesis of this initiative is to ensure that the needs of the individual business units are balanced against the benefits of scale, empowering our businesses unit leaders, and better positioning us to deliver on our mission. As a result, it became clear to us that there were more opportunities to streamline and focus processes, people and organizational priorities on business-critical activities. Specifically, our global cost optimization program includes the following; one, manufacturing cost infrastructure improvements; two, integrating corporate services in the business unit function; and three, improving our go-to-market sales strategy in our Rx and Consumer Healthcare International segments that totally impacted these global changes some of which have already occurred is expected to generate an annual savings of more than $130 million by mid-2018. This will impact approximately 750 employees globally, or 14% of our nonproduction workforce. This is on top of previously announced initiatives which my team continues to execute again. These decisive actions while difficult decisions for our board and management are critical to our ability to drive our business forward. Turning to slide 10; we are making significant progress in our CHC International business, and I believe we are on a path to capture substantial value by growing our OTC portfolio while enhancing margins over time. With these goals in mind, I would like to highlight some important developments. First, and we continue to enhance leadership across this business, I'm excited to announce the appointment of Svend Anderson to the position of Executive Vice President and President Consumer Healthcare International to enhance this business. Over the last 10 years, Svend has been working with consumer and Pharma businesses running their European division. He has done this for LEO-Pharma, Hospira, and Actavis. As we continue to build and innovate our branded consumer healthcare OTC portfolio, Svend will play a critical role along with our strong international leadership team in driving profitability across Europe. I am confident that he has the skills and expertise to assist in our endeavors and look forward to working closely with Svend to grow this business during the next phase of our transformation. The executive committee and I appreciate Sharon on providing leadership to the branded healthcare team during our critical period. His efforts to enhance the segment's leadership team, instill process discipline and drive execution have prepared the team to thrive under the new leaders - under a new leader such as Svend who has deep experience in growing branded products and driving a pan-European platform. As Svend transitions into his role, Sharon will continue to be a key executive for our company and businesses in Australia and Israel. Second, during the fourth quarter of 2016 we announced a restructuring program in Belgium. Today we're announcing that we have proactively canceled additional unprofitable distribution contracts in the CHC International segment in order to focus exclusively on the development, marketing, and sales of our own brand OTC product portfolio. The exit of these unprofitable distribution contracts in the segment is now expected to have a year-over-year negative impact to our net sales line of approximately $220 million in calendar year 2017 with no impact on profits. Third, in addition to these organizational changes, we continue to optimize our supply chain and infrastructure. The team is making great progress on enforcing and optimization of our overall supply chain. And forth, the new Head of our Branded Innovation and his team are hard at work driving the new product development process in this business. We're focused on expanding our product offerings, launching new line extensions under our well-known brand names and leveraging our products within our OTC categories. We believe this strategy will further enhance our brand equity and customer loyalty. Furthermore this long-term strategy is supported by a substantial increase in R&D for the CHC International segment in 2017 versus 2016. Now I would like to discuss our preliminary 2016 highlights in more detail on slide 11. 2016 was a transitional year for the organization, our employees and our shareholders. Before I move on, I would like to thank Perrigo's thousands of employees around the world who work diligently to ensure our strong fourth-quarter finish. Today we announced preliminary unaudited calendar year 2016 record net sales of $5.5 billion and more than $1 billion as expected operating cash flow. Within CHC Americas we achieved record performance in the infant nutrition category, which we expect to be a key long-term driver, in addition to solid performance in the smoking cessation category. We will launch a number of important new products, such as store brand versions of Flonase and certain products within the Mucinex family. We continue to deliver strong operating margins in this segment enhanced by strong supply chain performance. Within Rx while pricing erosion for the year was greater than expected, it was in line with our updated forecast in the second half of the year. We continue to manage the business for long-term profitability with strong R&D investments, and our recently announced partnership for our branded women health business. I now want to talk about my perspectives on 2017. Our primary objective as an organization in 2017 is to continue to simplify, focus, and execute on the fundamentals of our business. First, focus on operational execution, including investing and innovating for growth. Second, align our businesses and structures to better meet the demand of our customers. And third, complete our strategic portfolio review to ensure that we have the right model in place to drive both top and bottom line growth. Balance against these priorities are two main headwinds we anticipate in 2017 for our Rx segment. First, calendar 2015 performance benefited from $80 million in operating income from Entocort. This one time in fact is not expected to repeat at this level in 2017. In the past that was purchased in December 2015, the company did not anticipate all the increased market competition the product now faces resulting in significantly less operating income contribution from Entocort going forward. Second, in addition to the impact from Entocort, we expect 2017 price erosion in the rest of our Rx segment to be approximately 9% to 11%. We have a strong private label business that leads the industry and we expect to continue to develop this market. As you can see on this slide, over the last 13 weeks market dynamics are favorable and retail brands as a whole are continuing to grow. Looking at the category components of the data, you can see that store brand Infant Formula category continues to outpace National Brand growth wherein a leading store brand player and on the yields of a record 2016, we expect this category to drive long-term growth. This year's January, this year's cold season was more severe than last year's particularly in January although the season has slowed recently. In addition, store brand growth in this category outpaced national brand growth. We have long [indiscernible] Perrigo's unique business model and the data exemplifies the fact that consumers and the healthcare system in general continue to search for more affordable alternatives for their healthcare needs. Moving to slide 14, we've outlined a framework to continue to drive growth in CHC Americas, which we expect to grow at or above current market OTC growth rates. To be more specific, we believe this business can durably grow 2% to 4% organically over the long-term. Despite pricing headwinds, OTC and store brand growth remained strong. Consumer dynamics are favorable and national brands are driving new product innovation. All of these factors give a confident in this framework. Moving on to slide 15; the Rx segment continues to be one of our premier top - one of the premier topical businesses in the industry. We currently have 24 ANDAs pending FDA approval, six of which are first to file representing approximately $3.1 billion in branded sales. Further we expect to launch more than five products issue with branded sales of greater than $800 million. Now I want to take a minute to discuss our expectations for ProAir. We are not including contribution from the product in our 2017 guidance. We continue to respond the FDA's questions on this product. Currently we are working with our partner on a rigorous set of tests to ensure that our product performance matches that of the references for drug. We plan to be in a position to fully respond to the FDA's remaining questions in the second quarter of 2017 and will work closely with the agency towards approving this first-in-class generic product. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Ron. Ron, welcome to call. I appreciate your support. Ron Winowiecki You bet, thanks John, good afternoon everybody, I look forward to meeting you in the near future. I also look forward to continuing working with John, the rest of the Perrigo leadership team in the coming months as we continue to focus our previously stated action plan. I'd also like to take a moment and think Judy Brown for her support, guidance and leadership during our time together at Perrigo, as a friend and a colleague I certainly wish Judy the best in her new position. Moving now onto our results. I first want to discuss the notification that we filed with the STC to delay our 10-K filing. The scope of work that is still required the finalize Perrigo financial statements, included the final payment calculations related to the announced sales of Tysabri, and deferred tax assets and other related effects Omega Pharma NV. Let me provide some detail. As you saw on recent press release prepared a business development team finalized an agreement to announce the sale of the Tysabri royalty today. The accounting team taken this development and updated facts and circumstances that led to this announcement and is running a process to calculate the final impaired of value of the milestones associated with the Tysabri asset. Well, it may sound easy, the calculations are complicated and we need to have our calculations and procedures reviewed by our auditors. We provided our current estimated calculation in unaudited GAAP preliminary financial results reported today. In addition, certain deferred tax assets were identified that existed at the time of the acquisition of Omega, we are quantifying the result of these assets, which will be a non-cash re classification between goodwill and deferred taxes. Completing our procedures also require us to evaluate the related effects of this re classification. Further, in preparing the accounting treatment for today's announced sales of Tysabri and in completing the 10-K this quarter language associated with the new revenue recognition standard AFC-606, which goes into effect in 2018, late Wednesday, February 22, Ernst & Young, our independent auditors notified us that they are evaluating the historical revenue recognition practices associated with Tysabri. So let's go back and provide some color on this disclosure. For those of you who have followed the company since 2013, you will recall that the Tysabri royalty stream was a part of the Elan pharmaceutical acquisition which closed on December 18, 2013. The business operation of Elan including many assets in addition to the Tysabri Royalty Stream such as several equity joint ventures, a number pipeline products, as well as R&D, regulatory affairs and administrative functions. The Tysabri royalty was recognized as revenue in the non-financial statements filed with the SEC. I will review the accounting application at the time of the acquisition parable also independently concluded that the royalty stream from Biogen will be recognized as revenue in the financial statement at Perrigo. This accounting treatment was review with the NY, and agreed to under their audit opinions for fiscal year 2014, fiscal year 2015 and sub year 2015 as well. The reform 10-ks was unqualified audit opinion. In addition, as you know we have reported the Tysabri royalty stream and related results as a separate segment in our financial statements. As the timing of this review is unfortunately overlapping our earnings release today, we felt it important to provide you with a status update as well. There's one critical point I have to underscore for everyone. The final determination irrespective of how our independent auditors conclude that expected to have no impact on a historical or future expected net cash flows generated by the company, cash is always still cash. As John stated, we currently expect to file our form 10-K on or before March 16, 2017 within the 15 calendar dates extension period. We'll keep you updated in the event these expectations change. Now I will turn to Slide 18. You can see the preliminary unaudited 2026 performances results we provided in our press release. Net sales for the accountable year was $5.6 billion, with adjusted net sales of $5.5 billion. As a result the adjusted net sales exclude contributions some assets held for sale. Preliminary calendar year 2016 reporting operating loss, within a range of $4.65 billion to $4.68 billion with an adjusted operating income of $1.42 billion to $1.44 billion. I like to discuss the two main fourth quarter adjustments that impacted our calendar year reported operating income. First, we realized a tangible asset payment of $2.6 billion in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $201 million in especially science segment associated with the announced sales of Tysabri. Second, we identified impairment indicators for the Entocort intangible asset due to new entrance of new competition for this product, and that's reported an impairment charge of $336 million in the quarter. These non-cash effects combine with our other non-GAAP adjustments record in the fourth quarter and for the first nine months of the year resulted in a calendar year 2016 preliminary adjusted earnings per diluted share in the range of $7.10 to $7.25. Now I would like to turn to our 2017 guidance on Slide 19. There are a number of key assumptions I would like to take a moment to highlight. Within the CHC America segment we expect 2017 net sales of approximately $2.4 billion with an adjusted rating operating margin percentage in the low 20s. We assume a mid-year launch of the store brand version of NAXM [ph] and a number of smaller store brand OTC launches during the year. Also included in our guidance, are the recent cough/cold season dynamic John mentioned, which saw an increase in the incidence of cough/cold harbor since last year, as well to assumptions for average allergy and fluticasone seasons. In CHC international segment, or CACI, we expect the price of $1.4 billion in 2017 net sales. Segment net sales are impacted by two fundamental shifts in 2017. First; topline sales in the segment are unfavorably impacted by approximately $90 million due to the translation of foreign currencies. Second as John stated earlier, 2017 net sales to exclude $220 million due to the exit of certain distribution agreement in the segment. To help in your modeling, the quarter net sales effects of excluding these distribution agreements is included in Table 1 of this presentation. I'd also like to note that with announced cost savings in the removal of the profitable distribution businesses, we expect operating margin percentage in the segment in the low teens. And I would like to note that this includes increased investments in new products, supported by advertising and promotion spending, which is more heavily weighted toward the first half of 2017. Additionally, the timely cost improvement program, will be phased in over the course of the year. We expect that these combined effects will generate approximately 60% of segment operating income results in the second half of the year. Now let me take a minute to discuss the Rx net sales guidance of approximately $925 million in 2017. First, as previously discussed, we expect the negative year-over-year headwind to the topline of approximately $70 million, related to the increased competition in the Entocort market. In addition, our 2017 modeling assumptions, year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products are approximately 9% to 11%. Netted against these challenges is the positive contribution from our expected launch of more than five products with brand sales of greater than $800 million. Let me reiterate again, John's earlier comment that Proera [ph] is not included in our guidance, there's no contribution from this product in our model. As you may recall at the JPMorgan conference earlier this year, we announce a partnership for our brand named Women's Health Business, which significantly reduces excelling costs in the Rx segment. This action combined with the Morgan contribution from new product launches, and the effective of our costs improvement program, enabled us to maintain adjusted operating margins of approximately - approaching 40% in 2017 for this segment. As the management team, we are committed to long-term growth of our generic prescription business as we continue to make R&D - continue to invest R&D investments for new product that fit our growth strategy. Slide 20, aggregate effect of my segment comments, and illustrate the key year-over-year drivers. Let me first start with the head winds we are facing. First, Entocort alone is expected to have a 42% unfavorable impact to year-over-year adjusted EPS. Second, the impact of FX headwinds related to Brexit, and a strong dollar in an addition to jurisdictional composition included in our tax expense produced an additional head wind. On the operating flipside, we expect positive net sales and profit contribution, from our CHC Americas and CHC International businesses, approximately $200 million from new product launches in 2017, and a favorable impact from a cost improvement program as John outlined earlier. These combined factors, are expected offset the price erosion in 2017, and support our guidance range for adjusted EPS between $6.30 to $6.65 per diluted share. To be clear, without the pricing dynamics in the Rx business, and effective Entocort, our consumer facing businesses are forecast to achieve higher year-over-year profitability. The guides in our press released this afternoon, includes the Tysabri and our API business. Staying with the company's historical practices, we do not change guidance until a transaction closes. I would like to provide some modeling information to help you understand the effect of the Tysabri sale, on calendar 2017 guidance. As allied in the release, we expect the sales to close in 20 days. Assuming then, that if Tysabri were to be excluded for the entire year, and that we're to complete our debt paid on strategy by mid-year, the expected impact would be to lower calendar 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $2.12 to $2.18 per diluted share. Again to avoid confusion, Tysabri is currently in our guidance, we will update you the transaction closes and we complete our capital structure action plans. Now will turn to Slide 21. I would like to provide a brief update on our balance sheet and share our views for Q4 2017. As of December 31, 2016 total cash in the balance sheet was $622 million and total of that was approximately $20 billion. Expected cash from operating activities for calendar year 2016, is anticipated to be over $1 billion exceeding our previously revised guidance. On the right hand of the slide, you can see our cash flow and balance sheet priorities for 2017. First, we expect operating cash flow 2017 of greater than $850 million which includes the cash flow headwind impact of approximately $60 billion of payments related to our cost reduction program and higher tax payment on a year-over-year basis. They $850 million, the healthy cash flow generation will enable us to drive our capital allocation strategy. Our current operating plans to use this cash flow to pay down debt maturities which are coming due in 2017. When I was corporate treasure Perrigo, I had the pleasure launching our first investor grand bond offering in 2013, and the philosophies and principal outlined at that time remain today. We remain committed to investing rating, upon the closing of the average transaction we expect to move forward with the debt paid out strategy, consistent with our financial policies. I should also like to mention, we have good support from aboard for our investment rates and great financial policy. I'd like to now turn the call back to, John. John Hendrickson Thanks Ron, appreciate that. In Closing on Slide 23; I would like to reiterate the strength of our unique business model. Pharmaceutical company coupled with a fast moving consumer goods organization, layered on a world class complex supply chain. We made significant headway in the finding a path to enhance the value, and strength our business going forward. Our 2016 review of transition, I anticipate 2017 will be the year of execution. There we build upon that foundation and strive toward consolidating growth in 2018. We have the right team and the action plan in place to able us to capitalize on our business model and focus on payroll strength and providing quality affordable healthcare products to consumers and patients around the globe. Thank you. Brad? Bradley Joseph Thanks, John. As I said on the out sit of this call covered certain preliminary unaudited calendar year 2016 financial results. Given that these are preliminary unaudited results, we limit your questions today to 2017 financial guidance, leadership changes and our business and strategies. Specifically we are not going to take questions regarding the 2016 preliminary unaudited financial results. Operator we now like to open the call for questions and I ask everyone please limit yourself to one question only, thank you. Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman Okay one question maybe you can focus on the U.S consumer business. And talk about the pricing pressure that you were talking about that was 2% to 4%, what - what categories are you seeing in that pricing pressure and just give us a sense of what that pricing was in 2016, thanks. Bradley Joseph In the consumer Healthcare business, Marc, we have always seen certain pricing pressure in all launched new products, a number of competitors. I would say across the categories we compete in we have competitive pricing. We've done a good job of having costs, I mean cost savings, lying driving over these cost of goods, or operating strategies. So when we look at the growth of the business we expect the 2% to 4% to be after price - after pricing for solid growth. After the pricing challenges we expect off set a number of those with our cost initiative. Will say cough/cold, allergy some of those categories tend to be more hit by some of these pricing things, there are a lot of players within those categories. Marc Goodman But is it safe to say the cough/cold, allergy pricing. You're expecting to be a little worse in 2017 than 2016 or is it just a continuation of what we've seen. Bradley Joseph I would say we continue to experience some price challenges it not a new phenomenon, we continue to always have pricing in the consumer space, we expected to continue in different segments of pricing we have seen. Again, given the growth in the new products and everything we expect to be able to overcome that pricing challenge. Marc Goodman But like in infant [ph] formula and smoking cessation, are we seeing pricing pressure there or is it really just in those other spaces you mentioned. Bradley Joseph I would say we see it in all different segments comes differently across the board, but it certainly had so there's not just price compression from competitors, but making sure we are maximizing our promotion in those kinds in the market too. Retailers want to drive these brands and so we continue to help them try and drive profitability across the portfolio, which can impact some price compression and things that we get to drive that business. Marc Goodman I'm sorry just. Bradley Joseph Thanks, Marc. Operator And your next question comes from the line of David Risinger. David Risinger Hi, good evening. My question relates to CHC Americas. I guess could you just tell us within your EPS guidance for 2017, are you forecasting CHC America's operating income flat or down the rising in 2017, thank you. Ron Winowiecki David, this is Ron, thanks for the question. In my prepared remarks I commented on CHC America's, we do expect topline growth in the segment as we talked about we did expect operating margins in the low 20s. Again because we have not published 2016 information it's difficult for me to give you a relative compared year-over-year margin number but again the modeling we're using for the segment in 3017 is in low 20s, low 20% margin. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert. Gregg Gilbert Yes, thanks. John can you comment on where the Rx review is what you know and what you don't know, when you my complete that and mature overall philosophy, will that you and the boards willingness to take an offer versus the right offer, thanks. John Hendrickson Yes, thanks Gregg, appreciate the question. So first of all the new board assembled a good robust discussion and I would say all the business segments understanding whether add profitability to strategy with them, as you can imagine all the board getting engaged, given the new many members and so not trying to make any ultimate decision, and try and understand how they all fit together and what they do. So they continued on the path we have not clearly sit a ultimate date of decision must be made by X. and looking at that, I will say the directed to meet the board to keep driving this business, we would like to profitability, we'd be investments in R&D, deliver good operating margin, keep driving up the long term growth and profitability. So we are operating the business for the long term, not for just short term profitability. So I like their direction and I think as a board they will continue to evaluate it and see what it may sounds. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC capital. Randall Stanicky Great, thanks. I just had - I want to follow-up on the last question. John, can you talk about the hurdles, the specific hurdles in separating the Rx business out, both from a tax and cost perspective. And then the - attached from that question would be would you consider alternative ways of divesting this business, if you cannot find a buyer would you look at spinning it out or other creative structure to pursue that breakup? Thanks. John Hendrickson Yes, you got it Randall. So first of all, I just got to step back and - I've said this every time I know and everyone is probably getting tired of it. But this is a good, it's a good return business, high margin even with the pricing we were talking about, as Ron said still at a 40% kind of margin level. It's still a very good profitable business, good pipeline that we feel good about. All of those dynamics very favorable and I think the board themselves were liked what that looked like. When you think of all the potential possibilities from running it, keeping drive the profitability in [indiscernible] to separating. We are certainly not locked into any one option as far as what to do and how to do it. And again, keeping running it, keeping it integrated, keeping it as the core part of the business. There are as we look at cost of separation, there are tax issues related to separation. There are operating issues related to separation, that all come in the play in that strategy, but I would say everyone is in a fact gathering, understanding mode, at the board level to look at all the potential options. Randall Stanicky And there is no timeline in terms of how long should you - to go into I know there are some new board members that came on who I assume are going to take an active role in that process? John Hendrickson Yes, correct. All the board members are taking up very active roles in all the segments, but certainly in this. There is no timeline set, that we've said that we must have a decision by here or else. Again the Board has directed to me as to keep running the business to grow it and drive the profitability of it and that's where we are taking it right now. Randall Stanicky Okay. Thanks very much. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin Thank you. I have to say I'm still very confused by this 2017 guidance related to Tysabri. So when you're saying that when you close the Tysabri deal in 20 days, we have to take out $2.12 to $2.18. So that really assumes no offset? So I guess a couple questions. Number one, what are you going to do with that $2.2 billion in cash? Is that already incorporated in your debt pay-down guidance for the year and maybe if you could just be more specific, how much debt do you plan to pay down this year? Ron Winowiecki Hi Jami, this is Ron. Thanks again for the question. So again our earnings guidance is $6.30 to $6.65 for the year. So you made a comment that our Tysabri affected $2.12 per share to $2.18 is not a clear offset. That's actually not true. Again, we have to take a look at what is the Tysabri Royalty Stream and again you have to work with your models and I certainly… Jami Rubin But we have a number that's higher than the $2.12 to $2.18 so maybe that's part of it. Can you - how did you get to $2.12 to $2.18? Ron Winowiecki So again, let me just walk you through this. So you got to take the effect of Tysabri. We are not, we cannot provide our guidance for Tysabri. So you got to take your model, look at what you have allotted for the Royalty Stream. You have to take that on an after effect basis. So as you know this is an Irish held asset, it's in an efficient tax jurisdiction. Then you have to say okay, let's step back look at the debt pay down. Again we're reflecting $2.2 million and again we have [indiscernible] from our Board to continue our investment-grade financial policy. You can assume we're pointed at paying down debt. So you have to go through now, okay here's a various range the debt, the senior notes, what is the average interest rate on those senior notes over the curb, we're going to be smart from a P&L and from a future liquidity standpoint. And then you calculate that effect after-tax, because then you'll have again tax has as a deductibility in various jurisdiction and that results in the $2.12 and $2.18. You probably have a higher number. Jami Rubin I do. Ron Winowiecki My explanation is, one; I can't guess your model for Tysabri. Number two, again this is a mid-year debt pay down so is assuming midyear. So you may have some other assumption for the debt pay down. I can't interpolate that and… Jami Rubin You can't tell me how much debt you are going to pay down this year? Ron Winowiecki Well so, for this item. Again you say pay down as a share. So let's take that in two parts. So the one part is I communicated with our operating cash flow, we do expect to pay down debt maturities this year. Let's keep it [indiscernible] decide that's our guidance model. Now let's talk about that $2.12 and $2.18. We received $2.2 million in cash, you can assume that that cash is focused on debt pay down. Jami Rubin Okay. So at the end of the year, how much cash will you have at the end of 2017, after you paid down debt, how much cash will you have? Ron Winowiecki So we are not providing guidance on cash on balance sheet. So I am not going to provide that number right now Jami, if that's fair. Jami Rubin I am sorry. Can I just ask one more question? Did you guidance include - you did say OTC next, I think you said middle of the year. Is that right? John Hendrickson Right. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim. Louise Chen Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just curious if you strategic review ever considered divestiture of Omega and why not? And then just any update on this Amazon opportunity, is it still something you are interested to pursue? Thanks. John Hendrickson Yes, thanks. Yes, I would say the strategic review included everything. So the good thing again is we kind of looked at every business and say why do we love, what don't we like about it, what things we change, where we not executing as well as can so it was a broad and is a broad strategic review. We certainly looked at the performance we've had in the Consumer Healthcare International. But when we looked at the market dynamics, when we looked at the home are executional plans and what we thought we could drive or continuing to try and drive that platform for growth both top and bottom. And we believe that being in Europe with the consumer business that includes brands, value brand, store brand as well as some specialty products is a great platform to have. We've got to execute with it and deliver that value. So we continue to look at all those segments and not just pick on Rx, but continue look at all and make sure they're good, fir for us. I'd like to go back to Ron, I believe he said in his comments which is when we look at next year we've got a lot of Rx headwinds and certainly Tysabri moving on from it. So when you look at our consumer facing businesses they have some good strength year-over-year. Ron Winowiecki And Amazon. John Hendrickson And Amazon, sorry about the Amazon. We continue to think Amazon is a good opportunity, certainly the products especially as they get more and more efficient and real-time delivery. When you have a headache and you want your product now, not necessarily tomorrow. So we'll get much more efficient, I think it starts taking off. We are working with them, working with other players or the retailers have online aspect to most of their businesses, we work with those in marketing and driving our online business as well as Amazon. And we think, going forwards over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years I will continue to be a growth vehicle for us. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo Securities. David Maris Hi. One question and one definition. So first on the question. When the teacher says that students are energetic, they usually mean that the students are troublemaker. So when you said that the Board Meeting, the first meeting was I forgot that are invigorating or something… John Hendrickson Engaging maybe. David Maris Yes, engaging. So that everyone knows that's code for people have differences and we're debating it and they are new members. Can you just describe where there is agreement and where there may be differences of opinion of the direction of the company? And separately just as a definition you had mentioned that you're improving your go to market sales strategy. I just wanted to know what that means. John Hendrickson Sure. So first of all, I would not take anything I have said with the Board to in that way. We have had great board interactions, the Board members have worked well with each other trying to challenge management, think with each other, I would say very, again when I say invigorating, I mean very good breadths and depths of discussions. The new Board members bring different angles at things which has been very good for the whole Board. So I think it's been a good interaction clearly with Jeff Parker and Ted, who joined a little bit earlier. But then went with Jeff and Jeff Kindler as well as Brad just brings good angles to helping us think about things, helping us think about strategies. So it's been a very good productive engagement with the new board member so far and their cooperation with the existing board member. So very positive from my standpoint, can't speak highly enough for those interactions. On the second part of the question… David Maris Go to market sales strategy. John Hendrickson Go to market sales strategy, and I believe we're talking about the Rx side of the business is one of those. We basically had a branded portfolio of products that we [indiscernible] with someone. So we had a whole detailed salesforce that were driving those brands. They were good brands, we own them. We like the products but we did not have the scale nor did we want to invest in a number of new branded product in the Rx space. We partnered with another company to be our go to market arm where we fill on the product manufacture them actually take the orders et cetera. But they do the detailing and selling and it was a good way to still leverage the product portfolio and not have the broader complexities, expenses et cetera with a sales force. They have a sales force and even more products in their basket. So it was a very good collaboration to drive, its showing good results so far. David Maris Thank you very much. John Hendrickson Thanks. Operator Your next question come from the line of Dewey Steadman from Canaccord. Dewey Steadman Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just a really quick one on CHCI. Following the strategy changes and sort of the return of revenues there and new good leadership for that division other opportunities to synergize between CHCA and CHCI going forward? Thanks. John Hendrickson Great question. So we do have a fair amount of synergies on quality, cost of goods and operating side. So I'll start there, we put a team in place early on. And then we got to figure out what we can do, they had a lot of outsourced products and number of plants as we do. And our team there, we put people on the ground headed under Ron Winowiecki whole Irish operating supply team and they have been delivering great synergies between the businesses. Doing in forcing across our plants, making sure we deliver a high value across the products that part has been going well and we continue to try and expand what we can do there to help their cost of goods as well as their operating costs. The other side is we have a platform in Ireland and we continue to combine our Irish platform there with the platform of the operations in Nazareth, Belgium and continue to get the benefit out of doing that. On the sales side, there are some synergies not as much or as quick as we had originally expected. We originally expected to be able to launch more products. We are launching some products that tie into their value chain there. We are launching products here eventually that we think we can launch as good brands or control brand. But it's not as much early on as we expected, we continue to want to drive more value there. One of our good wins has been we had developed in the States with our partner in Denmark a nicotine gum, that was sort of best in class and with the purchase of the nicotine products that we did in our international CHC business, we're able to bring that innovation to them and actually launch that product here over the last month and a half or two months and are seeing good results. So we feel that franchise as smoking cessation and those kind of things continue to grow in Europe that can be a good franchise force there. As a global player we have a good supply chain to back that up. So that's a good example where working together has proven to be a beneficial thing. Dewey Steadman Thanks. John Hendrickson Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Christopher Schott Great. Thanks very much. Can you just come back to the US CHC business, I think you used to talk about that as a mid to high single-digit growth business. Obviously different environment now, but when we compare the 2% to 4% versus the prior guidance is this all price or is there an assumption you're making about new launches in there as well that might have changed? I'd just like a little bit more color on bridging between the old and the new. And then just a very quick follow-up on this issue of just debt pay down from here. Just might be helpful is there a target leverage ratio you need to get to post the Tysabri divestiture in order to keep investment grade rating? I think this might help us a little bit better under capital allocation priorities we just knew and where do you need to go on leverage at least in the near term? Thanks very much. John Hendrickson No, thank you. So I'll take the first part, and then Ron I think I'll pass the second part over to you if that's fair. Ron Winowiecki Yes. John Hendrickson So the first part. On the business side, I would say when we look at the markets today the switch products the categories all of that we feel are very optimistic on our CHC business and feel good about that. But when we look at all the components that we try to lay out with store brand growing favorable consumer dynamics, new products. You can see pretty strong volume growth across the segment and that's close to 5% to 6%. So good volume growth. The plants are running well and those kind of things, we do expect when we put in year pricing headwinds and so we build into our model we expect pricing and make sure that we have the costs and other initiatives to do that for net growth 2% to 4%. So rather than bridging back there were certainly switching and that was also an old models in the past from big switches, as well as general growth dynamic depending on the time period that we were in, but as we look forward for the next few years we are looking to be able to grow, which I think in general will be out above the pace of the normal U.S consumer business within the pharmaceutical and healthcare we know that we operate. Ron Winowiecki Yes, I think I will take the question. I think you phrase that as the target kind a leverage metric, so you look - 2016 information but if you look at the LTM metrics as the you know 9-30 you can see the company's running somewhere called the high tree support range relative to debt-to-EBITDA. So you can sit back and say what are the companies policies, priorities, we talked about those, so again if you look at next year, we are looking at $560 million, I think the exact number is 557 million of maturity, again we talk about how we're using operating cash flow is our intense to pay that debt down, so to your question is to take up the balance sheet. So we're looking at close Tysabri by $2.2 billion in 20 days that we mentioned at our remarks. Now again, at the [indiscernible] this in structure as we always look at the tax effect of the of the sale, look at what is the cost to pay debt down, you can run the models based on what debt is trading on today, do your own estimates but assume again for sake of discussion they're somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion there right, just to you kind of range. So what does that mean again I don't want to say every nickel and dime, goes the debt paid unless they were continuing to commit investment grade, we're continuing to work with agencies on our credit profile to ensure we continue marching down that path. If you take those numbers we are talking some more in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion of debt that would be paid out over the course of the year, you can run the leverage metrics, I don't think I need to do the math for you, so you can take the guidance, run off an EBITDA model, and then start saying what that metric come out to. Christopher Schott Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from a line of Douglas with Barclays. Douglas Tsao Hi, good morning - good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. It feels like morning maybe, but I'm - just you know maybe going back to Chris's question then again you know I think in that sort of megatrends waymarked [ph] you used to put out he's got sort of highlights of the like population demographics, as well as the store brand penetration growth of 2% to 3%, which now seems to be you know 1%. You know again to sort of curious in terms of expectations in terms of store brand conversion, what it's sort of like to that change - I mean it is sort of new product introduction or it is just simply a reflection of where we are and cycle in terms of the economy and that perhaps consumers are feeling better there perhaps looking for to more or sort of more biased toward purchasing national brands. John Hendrickson Yes, I think again I'm trying to not down hold - downplay 2% to 4%, I realize we're going on the 5%, but 2% to 4% means with all of that volume going 5% to 6%, Store brand gaining certainly volume share, profitability being offset somewhere, just pricing go on what happened there but still good volume growth could share growth when you look overall at what we're doing. There are some consumer dynamic, we believe continue to go that way, those mega trends you talk about in my mind are still very much at work. You know we're all getting older healthcare costs are doing nothing but go up no matter what we want to talk about, having a value proposition for consumers when they go to get it, is a great thing, we believe all those work in our favor. At this point when we look at all of those balance together and say organically again organically with a portfolio of the R&D that we're doing, what we see we believe a thing that realm, that does not mean that there are other inorganic opportunities there to rise additional growth but we're talking about here just base organic growth would be portfolio and R&D, more cost per segment that we're operating in. Douglas Tsao Okay. I guess John, in particularly focused on just why the OTC Store brand growth can be a little bit slower than what you had spoken about in the past, the company spoken about in the past. John Hendrickson Yes, so I think you know it all going back a couple years ago and saying here's what those dynamic were, I do good in laying out here is the dynamics today and got a lot organic growth I see and again there's still a fair amount of volume share, I do think be all the dynamics of growth, products switches all of those things lead us with this guidance, which again I feel is a very strong growing faster than segment, driving shares, doing those things performance. You can add on that [indiscernible], had some very good strong business. Douglas Tsao Okay, great. Thank you. Bradley Joseph Thanks, Doug. Last question, please. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Elliot Wilbur Thanks, good afternoon, appreciate your squeezing me in. Just want to come back to the Tysabri announcement, specifically question for Ron, is there anything you can say about the additional sales levels that would trigger the - The incremental step up in sales value there in terms of you know what those levels are. And then just a follow up to that in thinking about or try to model the company on a go forward basis new co obviously without the savage could have much higher effective tax rate, and looking at so the metrics you provided today coming up with an adjusted effective tax rate, excluding Tysabri royalty stream somewhere around 19% to 20% and just kind of a rough ballpark number one throughout out there and get some feedback on that, thanks. Ron Winowiecki Yes, you sure, you bet. So first the service - the effective tax rate; Elliot, you're in a stalling throw, I'm not going to say it right or wrong but take you in the window of acceptability, a relative to tax rate, we are not providing guidance on that today, we will certainly update our models to get that more details once we do close the transactions. So again within a stone's throw, listen we work with a partner were not disclosed in those terms and conditions, and we are not obligated to until we close, we like with all that that count until we get to that point, I think we will find is that a natural curve relative to Tysabri sales, it is always a bit outspread as you always know relative to any organic street model, so I don't want to predispose what's street numbers verses another, so it doesn't provide guidance so for me to go out there and start providing estimated revenues for the milestone now I don't this it is appropriate. So again we look at those, we understand what the metrics are, we worked our partner kind of what is the appropriate milestone for those sales thresholds, and again once that agreement becomes public we will provide more discussion at that point. John Hendrickson And again that's $250 million 2018, and $400 million in 2020, so as we discussed, so when they're due it's just the terms we will get once closed.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman from UBS. Marc Goodman Okay one question maybe you can focus on the U.S consumer business. And talk about the pricing pressure that you were talking about that was 2% to 4%, what - what categories are you seeing in that pricing pressure and just give us a sense of what that pricing was in 2016, thanks. Bradley Joseph In the consumer Healthcare business, Marc, we have always seen certain pricing pressure in all launched new products, a number of competitors. I would say across the categories we compete in we have competitive pricing. We've done a good job of having costs, I mean cost savings, lying driving over these cost of goods, or operating strategies. So when we look at the growth of the business we expect the 2% to 4% to be after price - after pricing for solid growth. After the pricing challenges we expect off set a number of those with our cost initiative. Will say cough/cold, allergy some of those categories tend to be more hit by some of these pricing things, there are a lot of players within those categories. Marc Goodman But is it safe to say the cough/cold, allergy pricing. You're expecting to be a little worse in 2017 than 2016 or is it just a continuation of what we've seen. Bradley Joseph I would say we continue to experience some price challenges it not a new phenomenon, we continue to always have pricing in the consumer space, we expected to continue in different segments of pricing we have seen. Again, given the growth in the new products and everything we expect to be able to overcome that pricing challenge. Marc Goodman But like in infant [ph] formula and smoking cessation, are we seeing pricing pressure there or is it really just in those other spaces you mentioned. Bradley Joseph I would say we see it in all different segments comes differently across the board, but it certainly had so there's not just price compression from competitors, but making sure we are maximizing our promotion in those kinds in the market too. Retailers want to drive these brands and so we continue to help them try and drive profitability across the portfolio, which can impact some price compression and things that we get to drive that business. Marc Goodman I'm sorry just. Bradley Joseph Thanks, Marc. Operator And your next question comes from the line of David Risinger. David Risinger Hi, good evening. My question relates to CHC Americas. I guess could you just tell us within your EPS guidance for 2017, are you forecasting CHC America's operating income flat or down the rising in 2017, thank you. Ron Winowiecki David, this is Ron, thanks for the question. In my prepared remarks I commented on CHC America's, we do expect topline growth in the segment as we talked about we did expect operating margins in the low 20s. Again because we have not published 2016 information it's difficult for me to give you a relative compared year-over-year margin number but again the modeling we're using for the segment in 3017 is in low 20s, low 20% margin. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert. Gregg Gilbert Yes, thanks. John can you comment on where the Rx review is what you know and what you don't know, when you my complete that and mature overall philosophy, will that you and the boards willingness to take an offer versus the right offer, thanks. John Hendrickson Yes, thanks Gregg, appreciate the question. So first of all the new board assembled a good robust discussion and I would say all the business segments understanding whether add profitability to strategy with them, as you can imagine all the board getting engaged, given the new many members and so not trying to make any ultimate decision, and try and understand how they all fit together and what they do. So they continued on the path we have not clearly sit a ultimate date of decision must be made by X. and looking at that, I will say the directed to meet the board to keep driving this business, we would like to profitability, we'd be investments in R&D, deliver good operating margin, keep driving up the long term growth and profitability. So we are operating the business for the long term, not for just short term profitability. So I like their direction and I think as a board they will continue to evaluate it and see what it may sounds. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Randall Stanicky from RBC capital. Randall Stanicky Great, thanks. I just had - I want to follow-up on the last question. John, can you talk about the hurdles, the specific hurdles in separating the Rx business out, both from a tax and cost perspective. And then the - attached from that question would be would you consider alternative ways of divesting this business, if you cannot find a buyer would you look at spinning it out or other creative structure to pursue that breakup? Thanks. John Hendrickson Yes, you got it Randall. So first of all, I just got to step back and - I've said this every time I know and everyone is probably getting tired of it. But this is a good, it's a good return business, high margin even with the pricing we were talking about, as Ron said still at a 40% kind of margin level. It's still a very good profitable business, good pipeline that we feel good about. All of those dynamics very favorable and I think the board themselves were liked what that looked like. When you think of all the potential possibilities from running it, keeping drive the profitability in [indiscernible] to separating. We are certainly not locked into any one option as far as what to do and how to do it. And again, keeping running it, keeping it integrated, keeping it as the core part of the business. There are as we look at cost of separation, there are tax issues related to separation. There are operating issues related to separation, that all come in the play in that strategy, but I would say everyone is in a fact gathering, understanding mode, at the board level to look at all the potential options. Randall Stanicky And there is no timeline in terms of how long should you - to go into I know there are some new board members that came on who I assume are going to take an active role in that process? John Hendrickson Yes, correct. All the board members are taking up very active roles in all the segments, but certainly in this. There is no timeline set, that we've said that we must have a decision by here or else. Again the Board has directed to me as to keep running the business to grow it and drive the profitability of it and that's where we are taking it right now. Randall Stanicky Okay. Thanks very much. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs. Jami Rubin Thank you. I have to say I'm still very confused by this 2017 guidance related to Tysabri. So when you're saying that when you close the Tysabri deal in 20 days, we have to take out $2.12 to $2.18. So that really assumes no offset? So I guess a couple questions. Number one, what are you going to do with that $2.2 billion in cash? Is that already incorporated in your debt pay-down guidance for the year and maybe if you could just be more specific, how much debt do you plan to pay down this year? Ron Winowiecki Hi Jami, this is Ron. Thanks again for the question. So again our earnings guidance is $6.30 to $6.65 for the year. So you made a comment that our Tysabri affected $2.12 per share to $2.18 is not a clear offset. That's actually not true. Again, we have to take a look at what is the Tysabri Royalty Stream and again you have to work with your models and I certainly… Jami Rubin But we have a number that's higher than the $2.12 to $2.18 so maybe that's part of it. Can you - how did you get to $2.12 to $2.18? Ron Winowiecki So again, let me just walk you through this. So you got to take the effect of Tysabri. We are not, we cannot provide our guidance for Tysabri. So you got to take your model, look at what you have allotted for the Royalty Stream. You have to take that on an after effect basis. So as you know this is an Irish held asset, it's in an efficient tax jurisdiction. Then you have to say okay, let's step back look at the debt pay down. Again we're reflecting $2.2 million and again we have [indiscernible] from our Board to continue our investment-grade financial policy. You can assume we're pointed at paying down debt. So you have to go through now, okay here's a various range the debt, the senior notes, what is the average interest rate on those senior notes over the curb, we're going to be smart from a P&L and from a future liquidity standpoint. And then you calculate that effect after-tax, because then you'll have again tax has as a deductibility in various jurisdiction and that results in the $2.12 and $2.18. You probably have a higher number. Jami Rubin I do. Ron Winowiecki My explanation is, one; I can't guess your model for Tysabri. Number two, again this is a mid-year debt pay down so is assuming midyear. So you may have some other assumption for the debt pay down. I can't interpolate that and… Jami Rubin You can't tell me how much debt you are going to pay down this year? Ron Winowiecki Well so, for this item. Again you say pay down as a share. So let's take that in two parts. So the one part is I communicated with our operating cash flow, we do expect to pay down debt maturities this year. Let's keep it [indiscernible] decide that's our guidance model. Now let's talk about that $2.12 and $2.18. We received $2.2 million in cash, you can assume that that cash is focused on debt pay down. Jami Rubin Okay. So at the end of the year, how much cash will you have at the end of 2017, after you paid down debt, how much cash will you have? Ron Winowiecki So we are not providing guidance on cash on balance sheet. So I am not going to provide that number right now Jami, if that's fair. Jami Rubin I am sorry. Can I just ask one more question? Did you guidance include - you did say OTC next, I think you said middle of the year. Is that right? John Hendrickson Right. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim. Louise Chen Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So just curious if you strategic review ever considered divestiture of Omega and why not? And then just any update on this Amazon opportunity, is it still something you are interested to pursue? Thanks. John Hendrickson Yes, thanks. Yes, I would say the strategic review included everything. So the good thing again is we kind of looked at every business and say why do we love, what don't we like about it, what things we change, where we not executing as well as can so it was a broad and is a broad strategic review. We certainly looked at the performance we've had in the Consumer Healthcare International. But when we looked at the market dynamics, when we looked at the home are executional plans and what we thought we could drive or continuing to try and drive that platform for growth both top and bottom. And we believe that being in Europe with the consumer business that includes brands, value brand, store brand as well as some specialty products is a great platform to have. We've got to execute with it and deliver that value. So we continue to look at all those segments and not just pick on Rx, but continue look at all and make sure they're good, fir for us. I'd like to go back to Ron, I believe he said in his comments which is when we look at next year we've got a lot of Rx headwinds and certainly Tysabri moving on from it. So when you look at our consumer facing businesses they have some good strength year-over-year. Ron Winowiecki And Amazon. John Hendrickson And Amazon, sorry about the Amazon. We continue to think Amazon is a good opportunity, certainly the products especially as they get more and more efficient and real-time delivery. When you have a headache and you want your product now, not necessarily tomorrow. So we'll get much more efficient, I think it starts taking off. We are working with them, working with other players or the retailers have online aspect to most of their businesses, we work with those in marketing and driving our online business as well as Amazon. And we think, going forwards over the next 2, 3, 4, 5 years I will continue to be a growth vehicle for us. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from the line of David Maris with Wells Fargo Securities. David Maris Hi. One question and one definition. So first on the question. When the teacher says that students are energetic, they usually mean that the students are troublemaker. So when you said that the Board Meeting, the first meeting was I forgot that are invigorating or something… John Hendrickson Engaging maybe. David Maris Yes, engaging. So that everyone knows that's code for people have differences and we're debating it and they are new members. Can you just describe where there is agreement and where there may be differences of opinion of the direction of the company? And separately just as a definition you had mentioned that you're improving your go to market sales strategy. I just wanted to know what that means. John Hendrickson Sure. So first of all, I would not take anything I have said with the Board to in that way. We have had great board interactions, the Board members have worked well with each other trying to challenge management, think with each other, I would say very, again when I say invigorating, I mean very good breadths and depths of discussions. The new Board members bring different angles at things which has been very good for the whole Board. So I think it's been a good interaction clearly with Jeff Parker and Ted, who joined a little bit earlier. But then went with Jeff and Jeff Kindler as well as Brad just brings good angles to helping us think about things, helping us think about strategies. So it's been a very good productive engagement with the new board member so far and their cooperation with the existing board member. So very positive from my standpoint, can't speak highly enough for those interactions. On the second part of the question… David Maris Go to market sales strategy. John Hendrickson Go to market sales strategy, and I believe we're talking about the Rx side of the business is one of those. We basically had a branded portfolio of products that we [indiscernible] with someone. So we had a whole detailed salesforce that were driving those brands. They were good brands, we own them. We like the products but we did not have the scale nor did we want to invest in a number of new branded product in the Rx space. We partnered with another company to be our go to market arm where we fill on the product manufacture them actually take the orders et cetera. But they do the detailing and selling and it was a good way to still leverage the product portfolio and not have the broader complexities, expenses et cetera with a sales force. They have a sales force and even more products in their basket. So it was a very good collaboration to drive, its showing good results so far. David Maris Thank you very much. John Hendrickson Thanks. Operator Your next question come from the line of Dewey Steadman from Canaccord. Dewey Steadman Hi guys, thanks for taking the question. Just a really quick one on CHCI. Following the strategy changes and sort of the return of revenues there and new good leadership for that division other opportunities to synergize between CHCA and CHCI going forward? Thanks. John Hendrickson Great question. So we do have a fair amount of synergies on quality, cost of goods and operating side. So I'll start there, we put a team in place early on. And then we got to figure out what we can do, they had a lot of outsourced products and number of plants as we do. And our team there, we put people on the ground headed under Ron Winowiecki whole Irish operating supply team and they have been delivering great synergies between the businesses. Doing in forcing across our plants, making sure we deliver a high value across the products that part has been going well and we continue to try and expand what we can do there to help their cost of goods as well as their operating costs. The other side is we have a platform in Ireland and we continue to combine our Irish platform there with the platform of the operations in Nazareth, Belgium and continue to get the benefit out of doing that. On the sales side, there are some synergies not as much or as quick as we had originally expected. We originally expected to be able to launch more products. We are launching some products that tie into their value chain there. We are launching products here eventually that we think we can launch as good brands or control brand. But it's not as much early on as we expected, we continue to want to drive more value there. One of our good wins has been we had developed in the States with our partner in Denmark a nicotine gum, that was sort of best in class and with the purchase of the nicotine products that we did in our international CHC business, we're able to bring that innovation to them and actually launch that product here over the last month and a half or two months and are seeing good results. So we feel that franchise as smoking cessation and those kind of things continue to grow in Europe that can be a good franchise force there. As a global player we have a good supply chain to back that up. So that's a good example where working together has proven to be a beneficial thing. Dewey Steadman Thanks. John Hendrickson Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JP Morgan. Christopher Schott Great. Thanks very much. Can you just come back to the US CHC business, I think you used to talk about that as a mid to high single-digit growth business. Obviously different environment now, but when we compare the 2% to 4% versus the prior guidance is this all price or is there an assumption you're making about new launches in there as well that might have changed? I'd just like a little bit more color on bridging between the old and the new. And then just a very quick follow-up on this issue of just debt pay down from here. Just might be helpful is there a target leverage ratio you need to get to post the Tysabri divestiture in order to keep investment grade rating? I think this might help us a little bit better under capital allocation priorities we just knew and where do you need to go on leverage at least in the near term? Thanks very much. John Hendrickson No, thank you. So I'll take the first part, and then Ron I think I'll pass the second part over to you if that's fair. Ron Winowiecki Yes. John Hendrickson So the first part. On the business side, I would say when we look at the markets today the switch products the categories all of that we feel are very optimistic on our CHC business and feel good about that. But when we look at all the components that we try to lay out with store brand growing favorable consumer dynamics, new products. You can see pretty strong volume growth across the segment and that's close to 5% to 6%. So good volume growth. The plants are running well and those kind of things, we do expect when we put in year pricing headwinds and so we build into our model we expect pricing and make sure that we have the costs and other initiatives to do that for net growth 2% to 4%. So rather than bridging back there were certainly switching and that was also an old models in the past from big switches, as well as general growth dynamic depending on the time period that we were in, but as we look forward for the next few years we are looking to be able to grow, which I think in general will be out above the pace of the normal U.S consumer business within the pharmaceutical and healthcare we know that we operate. Ron Winowiecki Yes, I think I will take the question. I think you phrase that as the target kind a leverage metric, so you look - 2016 information but if you look at the LTM metrics as the you know 9-30 you can see the company's running somewhere called the high tree support range relative to debt-to-EBITDA. So you can sit back and say what are the companies policies, priorities, we talked about those, so again if you look at next year, we are looking at $560 million, I think the exact number is 557 million of maturity, again we talk about how we're using operating cash flow is our intense to pay that debt down, so to your question is to take up the balance sheet. So we're looking at close Tysabri by $2.2 billion in 20 days that we mentioned at our remarks. Now again, at the [indiscernible] this in structure as we always look at the tax effect of the of the sale, look at what is the cost to pay debt down, you can run the models based on what debt is trading on today, do your own estimates but assume again for sake of discussion they're somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.1 billion there right, just to you kind of range. So what does that mean again I don't want to say every nickel and dime, goes the debt paid unless they were continuing to commit investment grade, we're continuing to work with agencies on our credit profile to ensure we continue marching down that path. If you take those numbers we are talking some more in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion of debt that would be paid out over the course of the year, you can run the leverage metrics, I don't think I need to do the math for you, so you can take the guidance, run off an EBITDA model, and then start saying what that metric come out to. Christopher Schott Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from a line of Douglas with Barclays. Douglas Tsao Hi, good morning - good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. It feels like morning maybe, but I'm - just you know maybe going back to Chris's question then again you know I think in that sort of megatrends waymarked [ph] you used to put out he's got sort of highlights of the like population demographics, as well as the store brand penetration growth of 2% to 3%, which now seems to be you know 1%. You know again to sort of curious in terms of expectations in terms of store brand conversion, what it's sort of like to that change - I mean it is sort of new product introduction or it is just simply a reflection of where we are and cycle in terms of the economy and that perhaps consumers are feeling better there perhaps looking for to more or sort of more biased toward purchasing national brands. John Hendrickson Yes, I think again I'm trying to not down hold - downplay 2% to 4%, I realize we're going on the 5%, but 2% to 4% means with all of that volume going 5% to 6%, Store brand gaining certainly volume share, profitability being offset somewhere, just pricing go on what happened there but still good volume growth could share growth when you look overall at what we're doing. There are some consumer dynamic, we believe continue to go that way, those mega trends you talk about in my mind are still very much at work. You know we're all getting older healthcare costs are doing nothing but go up no matter what we want to talk about, having a value proposition for consumers when they go to get it, is a great thing, we believe all those work in our favor. At this point when we look at all of those balance together and say organically again organically with a portfolio of the R&D that we're doing, what we see we believe a thing that realm, that does not mean that there are other inorganic opportunities there to rise additional growth but we're talking about here just base organic growth would be portfolio and R&D, more cost per segment that we're operating in. Douglas Tsao Okay. I guess John, in particularly focused on just why the OTC Store brand growth can be a little bit slower than what you had spoken about in the past, the company spoken about in the past. John Hendrickson Yes, so I think you know it all going back a couple years ago and saying here's what those dynamic were, I do good in laying out here is the dynamics today and got a lot organic growth I see and again there's still a fair amount of volume share, I do think be all the dynamics of growth, products switches all of those things lead us with this guidance, which again I feel is a very strong growing faster than segment, driving shares, doing those things performance. You can add on that [indiscernible], had some very good strong business. Douglas Tsao Okay, great. Thank you. Bradley Joseph Thanks, Doug. Last question, please. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Elliot Wilbur from Raymond James. Elliot Wilbur Thanks, good afternoon, appreciate your squeezing me in. Just want to come back to the Tysabri announcement, specifically question for Ron, is there anything you can say about the additional sales levels that would trigger the - The incremental step up in sales value there in terms of you know what those levels are. And then just a follow up to that in thinking about or try to model the company on a go forward basis new co obviously without the savage could have much higher effective tax rate, and looking at so the metrics you provided today coming up with an adjusted effective tax rate, excluding Tysabri royalty stream somewhere around 19% to 20% and just kind of a rough ballpark number one throughout out there and get some feedback on that, thanks. Ron Winowiecki Yes, you sure, you bet. So first the service - the effective tax rate; Elliot, you're in a stalling throw, I'm not going to say it right or wrong but take you in the window of acceptability, a relative to tax rate, we are not providing guidance on that today, we will certainly update our models to get that more details once we do close the transactions. So again within a stone's throw, listen we work with a partner were not disclosed in those terms and conditions, and we are not obligated to until we close, we like with all that that count until we get to that point, I think we will find is that a natural curve relative to Tysabri sales, it is always a bit outspread as you always know relative to any organic street model, so I don't want to predispose what's street numbers verses another, so it doesn't provide guidance so for me to go out there and start providing estimated revenues for the milestone now I don't this it is appropriate. So again we look at those, we understand what the metrics are, we worked our partner kind of what is the appropriate milestone for those sales thresholds, and again once that agreement becomes public we will provide more discussion at that point. John Hendrickson And again that's $250 million 2018, and $400 million in 2020, so as we discussed, so when they're due it's just the terms we will get once closed.

(NASDAQ: MU ) JP Morgan Global Internet, Media and Technology Brokers Conference May 24, 2017 10:00 a.m. ET Executives Ernie Maddock - CFO Analysts Harlan Sur - JP Morgan Harlan Sur Why don\'t we go ahead and get started. Again, welcome to the third day of JP Morgan\'s 45th Annual TMT Conference. Again, my name is Harlan Sur; I\'m the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment analyst here for the firm. We\'re very pleased to have Ernie Maddock, the Chief Financial Officer of Micron Technology here with us today. We have a lot of questions lined up, I\'m sure you have a lot of questions lined up. So I think we\'re going to jump right into it. And so, Ernie, thank you very much for joining us this morning.  Ernie Maddock It\'s my pleasure. Harlan Sur New CEO, it\'s only been a couple of weeks. You\'re new President and Chief Executive Officer, Sanjay Mehrotra, we knew him. We used to cover SanDisk, and so he had a solid tenure at SanDisk. Obviously he was one of the co-founders of the company who basically for most of you that probably noticed, but SanDisk basically pioneered NAND flash for the industry. He was instrumental in driving their industry leadership, not only from a manufacturing and operations perspective, but when he took over as CEO, 2011 through 2016; he really transformed the company from a chip company to a systems company, right. He drove their leadership in client and enterprise SSD. And then, obviously, they were acquired by Western Digital. And so, as a part of all of this, we want to get your views, your initial interactions with Sanjay, and maybe a little bit of a snapshot of his priorities and his vision for the company on a go-forward basis. Ernie Maddock Sure. So, you\'ve given a great sort of summary of this career, and I would say, having spent a reasonable amount of time with him and in his three weeks of tenure, it\'s everything that you\'ve said, and more. He obviously is in a bit of a learning mode with respect to DRAM because it\'s a big part of our business, and it\'s not something that he has a lot of familiarity with. But I think one of the things I\'m most impressed with during his tenure there, anytime somebody new comes into the business you\'re very tempted to look at everything you see, and say, "Well, I did it this way, I did it that way." And he\'s been incredibly thoughtful about how he has approached the situations, being appropriately challenging to some things that he felt we have the opportunity to better, but also being respectful and acknowledging the things that surpassed sort of the expectations that he had coming in. So, I think he was a fantastic choice. Really looking forward to working with him. And I expect that he will continue on the progress that Mark Durcan built, as with come into our own with respect to some of our technology transitions and the productization of those technology transitions, particularly in the NAND space. Harlan Sur Great. Okay, that\'s great. We look forward to building the relationship with him, and potentially hearing him on the next earnings call. Let\'s turn to the business at hand. Demand environment appears actually quite strong here in the first half of the year. We\'ve had 14 of our semiconductor companies from a broad swathe, including semi cap equipment companies from a broad swathe of the different industries here at our conference the last couple of days. And by and large, the key takeaway is that demand is healthy here in the first half of the year. And as we look into the second-half of the year, demand continues to be one of strength. And I\'ll point to specific areas that does seem to be outgrowing the overall markets, and that is in the areas of cloud and datacenter spending. It\'s not a surprise that companies like Google, and Amazon, and Facebook are spending at record CapEx levels, which includes servers, which includes networking, and all of the big iron pieces of equipment that actually consume quite a bit of memory. We\'ve had some strong smart phone launches here in the first half of the year. Obviously there\'s going to be more on to come in the second-half of the year. And compute PC fundamentals seem to be tracking relatively in line with kind of normal seasonal trends. You layer on top of that, I think, what continues to be, at least what we hear from some of your customers, a pretty tight both DRAM and NAND component availability environment, and so it feels like the setup is really good financial performance-wise from Micron. We\'d love to get your views on the current environment. Ernie Maddock Sure. So they\'re very consistent with what you\'ve heard, and actually pretty consistent with what we\'ve been saying all year. We believe that on the DRAM side you\'re going to see somewhere between 15% and 20% growth in bits supplied, that\'s something that the other suppliers in the market are also saying, within reasonable range. And then on the demand side, based upon the nice summary that you gave, with a slightly favorable PC business, a really robust cloud server infrastructure type business, a good mobile business, and a good automotive and sort of embedded business, that you\'re going to have demand somewhere in the 20%-25% big-growth range, and therefore you have the setup for some stability from a pricing perspective, which is actually what we\'ve seen now here over the course of the last several months. In fact, we\'ve been in a bit of a rising pricing environment over that period of time. On the NAND front, we think that bits supplied will be somewhere between 35% and 40% this year. We\'re actually a little bit on the higher end of the ranges of the ranges that our competitors talk about. And that we think that demand is certainly meaningfully in excess of that if you sort of model that what unconstrained demand would be if you were following the cost curve that 3D transition would allow. And so that\'s creating some fairly healthy fundamentals there as well. And based on everything that we see right now there isn\'t going to be a material change in that supply demand dynamic here as we look over the next few quarter certainly, and maybe a little bit beyond that point. Harlan Sur Right. So we had one of the semi cap here just before you. And they keep their fingers on the pulse of what\'s happening. Obviously technology migration as well as capacity expansion, it was interesting because DRAM CapEx spending off of a low base, right, we have to keep [ph] off of a low base in 2016, is up this year, but their view was majority of that is technology migration; there\'s very little capacity expansion. And their view was, exiting this year, industry capacity is probably flat. And I don\'t know if you have a view on total industry capacity dynamics, and your sense of where that could be exiting this year? Ernie Maddock I think that\'s reasonably consistent with certainly what we\'ve said about our intent, and then certainly the public comments of the other industry participants have been pretty much exactly that. That while you do get some wafer loss as a result of technology transitions, the intent that we have is to maintain flat wafer outs, so essentially you are adding a little bit of capacity to make up for those lost wafer outs, but as an industry as a whole, you are not adding substantial incremental industry wafers and that would contribute to or allow you to get into this 15% to 20% range in terms of bit growth because technology transitions alone will put you at or below the low end of that range. Harlan Sur Yes. So let\'s start with the DRAM business. We obviously track the third-party spot and contract pricing which may or may not be a proxy for some of the other segments of your business, but general trend was I think we had a good sense of what\'s happening. And basically until the end of April, we had seen you know, DDR4 spot pricing continue to increase whereas now things have started to sort of flat line. On the other hand, contract pricing, right, which is still I don\'t know fairly well below where the level of spot pricing is has continued to climb. Now, in the context of a diversified portfolio that you have and broad based customers, how should we assume what lag in contract pricing heading into the seasonally stronger part of the year, how does this impact the sort of dynamics of the business? Ernie Maddock Sure. So in general if contract pricing is lagging spot pricing, it is reasonable to think that you are going to see some upward pressure… Harlan Sur Yes. Ernie Maddock …on spot pricing that is most directly applicable to the client segment which is most immediately adjacent to that spot market, I think we\'ve talked about before the fact that in server environment, in the mobile environment these contracts are negotiated less frequently. They still follow the general trend that you see on the PC side of the house, but there is some time lag and there is certainly a difference in amplitude, right? From the prior trough to the peak to the trough, mobile pricing was much more stable than PC pricing. And so as a result PC has increased dramatically over the last nine months. Mobile pricing is coming up but it comes up on a percentage basis, much less -- to a much less significant degree. But in general, it\'s reasonable to think that as long as there is a gap between spot and contract, and spot remains stable that that will inform the discussions that we have with our customers and the resulting contract pricing. Harlan Sur And are you seeing that same trend on the server part of the business as well? Ernie Maddock In general, yes. All of the other segments are informed by what happens in that client and spot segment although to different degrees. So while they were in the middle of a difficult pricing environment, they tend to be better profitability opportunities. In a very robust environment, the profitability there by segment can actually lag a little bit, right. We\'ve talked about the fact on our calls that the normal hierarchy of pricing has flattened considerably given the current supply demand environment. Harlan Sur Yes. So there seems to be a pervasive view out there building that the resilience of the positive supply/demand dynamics out in the industry both for DRAM and for NAND has the potential to create de-specking, demand destruction, maybe primarily in PCs and smartphones, maybe less so in some other cloud data center segments of the market; wanted to get your view on that. Are you starting to see some of that in any of these end markets because that seems to be sort of a growing fear with the memory industry right now? Ernie Maddock We\'re actually not and there is a logical reason why we think that that exist. So as you talked about earlier, one of the biggest consumers of DRAM and NAND for the record, but since we are talking about DRAM is Google, Amazon, Facebook deploying these data center deployments. Well, you look at the economic equation of that data center deployment and the economics that Google, Amazon, and Apple face as companies versus PCs and they are just night and day difference. So the value if you will that those data center deployments provide to those clients, the profitability margins they have. And then, on the other side the relative price of memory in the context of that data center deployment is a very different equation than what a PC manufacturer is looking like who is operating with 5% margins and wants to really tightly control BAM [ph] content. Even then on the PC space, what\'s driving PC growth is very high performance or ultra-light form factor PCs which rely on more concentration of memory or particularly high performance memory and so the value equation there, if you\'re about to pay $1500 for a PC because it delivers capability to you, you\'re probably willing to pay $1550 if in fact that\'s what that\'s what it costs. So, these are not content gains that are happening in $300 and $400 PC\'s, these are content gains that are happening in a very specific part of the market that happens to be fast growing right now because of all the other underlying trends around artificial intelligence, virtual reality these are essentially gateway devices into those realms and therefore the devices that are being used for those require that memory content. Harlan Sur And then so to kind of follow up on that, I mean, there are all of these new demand drivers and just even over the past week Nvidia out there, GPU Technology Conference, their Analyst Day AMD rolled out their entirely new product line of Cloud based products and a big focus on machine learning in AI and just to throw some statistics out there, the average cloud server based off of our memory model has 256 gigabytes of DRAM per server on the deep learning and AI side for example Google\'s new Tensor processor engine and the pod that it sits and consumes like 16 terabytes of DRAM and Nvidia\'s DGX-1 Supercomputer in a box has something on the order of almost 1 terabyte of DRAM per system and so big driver of demand in that business. And so you\'re If I remember back to your last earnings call, your server mix went from 15% of the mix in the prior quarter to 25% of the mix in the quarter that you reported, do you expect that server mix to kind of continue to move higher as the year unfolds just given all of these dynamics? Ernie Maddock We do and that\'s both a statement about what the raw demands profile looks like but also a statement about the fact that Micron has consistently tried to address segments that we believe will provide better long-term differentiation, better long-term opportunity to form customer relationships that are particularly important to a company like Micron were we are essentially 20% to 25% of industry that\'s right. We need to form and highly value those relationships perhaps in a different way than our competitors who have much more dominant share so, it\'s both a market statement but also a very specific statement of company intent as we\'ve talked about for a long time to address those parts of the market where we think we have the ability to differentiate. Harlan Sur Let\'s talk about another end market that seems, that actually also grew pretty significantly for you guys last quarter in fact I think it\'s grown for sequential quarters for you guys and that\'s automotive and then we talked you and I talked about this at CES as well, but that\'s been a growing business and it\'s clearly as we see all of this intelligence whether it\'s a dash, whether it\'s somewhat sophisticated digital dashboard I mean you can tell that sitting behind that is the requirements for more memory. And then as we move from semi to fully autonomous and we start putting processes in the car. We kind of see things will be taking off from there, but question to you is what has led to Microns competitive strength within automotive? I think in terms of content growth you discussed an opportunity of four to five times larger content growth over the next five to seven years what are some of the unique storage capabilities that Micron can is bringing to customers now can offer to customers in the automotive markets. Ernie Maddock I think the thing that\'s most important to automotive customers is one that the standards to which they must call and you\'re typically not selling directly to the auto manufacture, you\'re selling to the subsystem guys, Continental or Bosch or you know, and any one of these suppliers, right. So, the level of rigor and quality testing for automotive is distinctly more challenging and more difficult than exist for even the next most rigorous application whatever that is. These things have to operate in temperature ranges that are virtually not seen in any other application maybe some mobile even then you are typically limited to a much smaller temperature range and you would normally see in a -- a mobile device will have a much smaller temperature range, and there is a requirement to certify end-to-end throughout your company, right? So, you have to start at the supply chain, start with how weak were all our suppliers, the quality processes that you go through to manufacture, to package, to test. Those things are all distinctly different for the automotive business. And so you have to make a long-term investment in that, and that\'s what Micron has chosen to do, which has really helped it in terms of solidifying a very, very strong market share position. And then if you look at what\'s required on a going-forward basis, we\'re in the process of calling 2019 and 2020 cars or subsystems that go into those cars. And once that\'s called what the subsystem guys want more than anything else is assured supply, and assured stability of supply, because just because we want to migrate to a new technology node, and that may give us a 15% cost reduction, the cost to them of having to recall that across their entire client base is a real economic challenge. And so they want the certainty of assured supply. And literally zero defects, right, given the applications that are created there. So I\'d say that\'s the primary difference in that market. Micron has clearly focused there. We have deep relationships; we\'ve been extremely successful in getting a broad swathe of customers very comfortable with our commitment to that market. So, unlike any other market where although there\'s a cost of entering and exiting, and reentering and exiting, if there\'s any suspicion on the part of these customers that you are not committed to that market for the long haul they\'ll just move on to a supplier who is. And so that\'s how the company has differentiated itself. Question-and-Answer Session Harlan Sur Great. Why don\'t we open it up for questions? If you do have questions, I would ask just wait for the microphone. Any questions out there? I\'ve got one right up here. Unidentified Analyst So, the business is notorious for being cyclical, obviously. What difference did you see in this particular good cycle than you\'ve seen in previously cycles? Ernie Maddock I think typical cyclical behavior can be driven by one of two things. It can be driven by an unexpected weakness in demand, or it can be driven by an ill-considered addition of capacity. And the very worse cycles occur when those two things happen simultaneously. So I think, as I commented earlier, if you listen to the commentary coming from industry participants on the supply side it reflects a great deal of discipline and thoughtfulness with respect to how the industry participants are considering supply expansion. And it\'s important that as long as supply is trailing slightly behind demand you actually, as a supplier, have a great chance to respond to unexpected prohibitions in demand. So that\'s the one thing that we can\'t control as a supplier. You can\'t control what\'s happening to the demand environment. So I think the trigger for the most recent downturn was just protracted weakness in the PC business that extended well beyond into a greater level of severity than any industry pundit was forecasting at the time. And that happened to coincide with an expansion of supply that was not ill-considered. It was actually reasonably well considered. However, it occurred and flew straight in to the face of a pretty weak PC market. And even with those conditions you saw the industry actually move through the difficult time fairly quickly at aggregate levels of profitability that were substantially higher than they were in the prior cycles. So those are the two dynamics I think on the supply side. Although we don\'t speak for the industry, the other participants have spoken and indicated a great deal of discipline. And then on the demand side, there are fairly healthy fundamentals that we can all more personally relate to, right. So this isn\'t about how many PC units are sold anymore, it\'s about how much data companies want to collect about you, and your family, and your habits relative to social media, and any number of things that are causing the need to amass larger and larger amounts of data. And we don\'t see any abatement in that trend. And if there\'s no abatement in that trend then it\'s hard to imagine why you would see a protracted downturn in memory consumption. Harlan Sur Good question. Do we have any other questions? We\'ve got one right up here. Go ahead, Matt, just go ahead. Unidentified Analyst I wondered if you just might comment on the potential risks of a deal with the Toshiba assets, how that might not be disruptive [indiscernible]? Harlan Sur So, just to repeat the question, the question was on the pending deal of the Toshiba memory assets, how that might or might not impact the industry/Micron dynamics? Ernie Maddock I think the easiest way to think about these because there are a hundred different angles that you could apply to it is, is any potential acquirer likely to take a capital plan that that joint venture has and expand it dramatically, right. Because at the very highest level, what would an existing industry participant be concerned about? They\'d be concerned that supply will expand more quickly than we currently expect. Now, let\'s all remember that that joint venture, as evidenced by some comments that WD has made, already has aggressive plans for a 3D conversion, and progressing through the technology stack. And so there must be an underlying capital plan that supports that. And I don\'t have privy to exactly what it is, but it\'s there. And so unless that materially changes, then our view of the industry supply dynamic would remain relatively intact. And therefore there\'d be much less incremental change than I think folks might fear. So that\'s what I would think about it at the most high level there is, is it going to change the fundamental industry supply-demand dynamics. And frankly, if an existing industry participant ends up being the ultimate acquirer. We all know how tough it is to be in this business, and so it doesn\'t seem like a greater likelihood that capital plans would actually be expanded and increased. Harlan Sur Question right over here. Unidentified Analyst Hi, thanks. Just with the transition to 3D NAND, you talked about the supply and demand dynamics generally as you see them now. Compared to a year ago, looking at it today, I guess expansion of 3D NAND capacity, what does that do to the overall supply dynamic you think as you look out 12 months? And what might change those assumptions? Ernie Maddock So, we have said that we believe in the long-term, and the long-term being through 2020 at this point, that you are going to have a bit demand CAGR that\'s in the 45% plus or minus range. As we look at the supply side of that, this year, industry participants are estimating between 30% and 40%. And again, there\'s been a pretty -- I think the thing that\'s important to remember is the consistency with which people have been talking about their estimates for bit growth. And that particular range has now been sort of inculcated for a good part of 12 months, which says that suppliers have an understanding of what they\'re doing, and have an understanding of what each other are doing, and therefore are able within a reasonable range of error to sort of predict that. So I would expect that you will see calendar year \'18 bit supply growth to inch up, because a lot of companies are going through a 3D conversion this year. Micron went through the bulk of its conversion in our prior fiscal year, so crossing over a couple of calendar years, right. So bit supply growth is likely to expand. But bear in mind that this is an incredibly elastic market. So the rate of expansion in bit supply next year based on everything we can sort of pencil out on the back of our napkins or notebooks or whatever we do that with is still not in excess of what you would expect demand to increase by, given a normal cost curve that comes with those technology transitions. And then if you get out two or three years, and you\'re talking about third-generation NAND and maybe a QLC implementation, you are going to have a cost-per-bit dynamic that will really lend itself to ubiquitous replacement of HGVs even in things like desktops, where that market hasn\'t even begun to be tapped. And so it doesn\'t feel as if the opportunity is there for any sort of protracted imbalance. Now, that\'s not to say that in any given quarter there is going to be a little bit of a mismatch. This is not so perfectly orchestrated. But with the industry elasticity that we see, the capital investments that are our friends in the equipment business can validate. It just doesn\'t feel like we are on a terribly dangerous path right now as an industry. Harlan Sur Any other questions? Let\'s focus on the things that you and the team can control. And so you have discussed the 1x nanometer DRAM transition. You are going through that, right. I think the team\'s view is that this is going to be a meaningful part of the output by end of fiscal year \'17, which is your August quarter, if you could give us an update there? Yields, are they are tracking towards your expectation? Do you still expected to be meaningful part of your output? And maybe if you can just go one step further and help us understand when do we see bit crossover 2x versus 1x? Ernie Maddock So, we are on track for meaningful output. We will probably talk more about when would be bit crossover a little bit later on in the fiscal year. So there is going to be no new news there. But the yields continue to be good. We are coming up the yield curve actually pretty much exactly as we would have expected to. We are also simultaneously in the back half of this year going to be rolling out 1Y node. And so one of the reasons why we haven\'t specifically talked about bit crossover is we want to see how those two things come along because obviously how we feel about 1Y will to some degree influence how aggressively we ramp 1x. Harlan Sur And so, it sounds like executing to plan on 1x, getting ready to bring 1Y into production second half of this year, and so far on 1Y things also tracking relative to expectations. Ernie Maddock They are absolutely. Harlan Sur Okay, great. And then again from an execution perspective doing what you say you are going to do, we all remember last year, you had a bit of a hiccup delay in qualifying your LPDDR for mobile DRAM for some of the big second half smartphone launches. Wanted to know one year later obviously we are getting ready for some big flagship smartphone ramps in the second half of this year, how have the qualifications gone this year? Ernie Maddock Qualifications are doing well while acknowledging exactly what you said that weren\'t qualified, we also were in the process of ramping that 20 nanometer technology node at that time. And so we knew that that window was much, much more narrow than a typical qualification window. And we didn\'t get across the finish line, so, no argument with that. But this year is quite different relative to that call cycle and the company\'s readiness for that. Harlan Sur Great. Good to hear. Let\'s switch over to NAND then. Again the things that you do have control over. Team is making the transition. I think it\'s a big transition from 32 layer to 64 layers. It\'s for GEN2. Again, you\'ve discussed meaningful bit output exiting your August quarter, if you could give us an update there? Ernie Maddock So we still expect that. In terms of an absolute percentage it\'s actually slightly higher, but not high enough that will change the description of meaningful output. But again coming up the yield curve on that field -- feel very, very good about the implementation of 64 layer within the company. Harlan Sur And there on 3D I would say maybe relative to DRAM, I think in 3D obviously I think the team has some pretty big performance differentiators. And that\'s what we hear from some of your customers as it relates to performance. And so maybe you can help us understand are you -- do you continue to hear the same thing about your performance advantages? Obviously, you have a very different architecture, right, as it relates to not only just size of the chip but performance of the chip. Ernie Maddock I think it\'s important to understand that when somebody is consuming a NAND, right, to speak generically they are actually consuming it in the form of SSD or some other packaged solution, so, unlike a DRAM where you sell more modules with NAND. Somewhere north of 80% of the products that we sell to our customers are actually packaged solutions. And so, when they think about performance, they are thinking about it in terms of the performance of the device that they are looking at. So let\'s take an SSD. And it really I think speaks to the thoughtfulness that we have put into not only understanding what the raw device is capable of but also the thoughtfulness we have put into understanding what our customers plan to do with that equipment. And then, tailoring the firmware and the controller around that, and then, again leveraging the customer relationships to help make sure that we have an unfair advantage in terms of understanding their needs and requirements. And if you have a better understanding of that, you have the best chance of actually exceeding their expectations. And I think that\'s what you see happening now. Harlan Sur Great. Do we have any questions from the audience? Unidentified Analyst Two questions; first one is regarding your overall SSD output. How much is client and how much is enterprise? And the second question would be do you see material constraints? I mean in terms of wafers for instance? Or for you self clean room capacity or potential other constraints? Ernie Maddock So I think it\'s well known that that raw wafers are in tight supply. We have done I think the things we need to do as a company to protect and insure for supply relative to clean room space we expanded our Singapore fabs, started that expansion, completed it actually now about a year ago. So we have ample space to pursue the objectives that we have relative to NAND. And then on your question about client versus enterprise or cloud, we don\'t specifically talk about the segmentation. I will say that that actually is beginning to be a bit of a blurry space. So what you were originally designing as a client SSD actually because of its performance characteristics and its price point, the cloud consumers are actually quite interested in it. What was an enterprise class SSD is also moving down into that cloud space. So what\'s happening is at the margin those markets are either staying relatively constant or shrinking a little bit. While in the middle, this sort of cloud space is morphing. And I think it\'s probably a little more challenging today to sort of identify what\'s what than it was 12 months ago when there were clearer delineations between those boundaries. Harlan Sur Little bit more time here. My last question again along those same lines is that one of the things as we have been tracking Micron for as long as we have been tracking is we\'ve always wanted the team to drive more on the systems level solution SSDs whether that\'s client or whether that\'s enterprise. And we actually started in the last quarter sort of the SSD start to kind of breakout, right? So is this year -- is 2017 the year enterprise and client -- and we hear good out in the channels as well, is this is the year that we start to see Micron really move up the market share rankings on the SSD front? Ernie Maddock Well, if we execute successfully, yes, and I think we have been very clear about our timing and intent on this. And to sort of reinforce the concept to introduce of doing what you are going to say and then -- saying what you are going to do and doing it. This is exactly the path that we had outlined. So, really does reinforce the fact that the team was thoughtful about how we set forth down this path. And we are executing to that with a fair amount of precision. So we are pretty pleased with the progress there and think there is a more yet to be made. Harlan Sur Ernie, thank you very much for joining us today, and thank you for your insights.

Why don't we open it up for questions? If you do have questions, I would ask just wait for the microphone. Any questions out there? I've got one right up here. Unidentified Analyst So, the business is notorious for being cyclical, obviously. What difference did you see in this particular good cycle than you've seen in previously cycles? Ernie Maddock I think typical cyclical behavior can be driven by one of two things. It can be driven by an unexpected weakness in demand, or it can be driven by an ill-considered addition of capacity. And the very worse cycles occur when those two things happen simultaneously. So I think, as I commented earlier, if you listen to the commentary coming from industry participants on the supply side it reflects a great deal of discipline and thoughtfulness with respect to how the industry participants are considering supply expansion. And it's important that as long as supply is trailing slightly behind demand you actually, as a supplier, have a great chance to respond to unexpected prohibitions in demand. So that's the one thing that we can't control as a supplier. You can't control what's happening to the demand environment. So I think the trigger for the most recent downturn was just protracted weakness in the PC business that extended well beyond into a greater level of severity than any industry pundit was forecasting at the time. And that happened to coincide with an expansion of supply that was not ill-considered. It was actually reasonably well considered. However, it occurred and flew straight in to the face of a pretty weak PC market. And even with those conditions you saw the industry actually move through the difficult time fairly quickly at aggregate levels of profitability that were substantially higher than they were in the prior cycles. So those are the two dynamics I think on the supply side. Although we don't speak for the industry, the other participants have spoken and indicated a great deal of discipline. And then on the demand side, there are fairly healthy fundamentals that we can all more personally relate to, right. So this isn't about how many PC units are sold anymore, it's about how much data companies want to collect about you, and your family, and your habits relative to social media, and any number of things that are causing the need to amass larger and larger amounts of data. And we don't see any abatement in that trend. And if there's no abatement in that trend then it's hard to imagine why you would see a protracted downturn in memory consumption. Harlan Sur Good question. Do we have any other questions? We've got one right up here. Go ahead, Matt, just go ahead. Unidentified Analyst I wondered if you just might comment on the potential risks of a deal with the Toshiba assets, how that might not be disruptive [indiscernible]? Harlan Sur So, just to repeat the question, the question was on the pending deal of the Toshiba memory assets, how that might or might not impact the industry/Micron dynamics? Ernie Maddock I think the easiest way to think about these because there are a hundred different angles that you could apply to it is, is any potential acquirer likely to take a capital plan that that joint venture has and expand it dramatically, right. Because at the very highest level, what would an existing industry participant be concerned about? They'd be concerned that supply will expand more quickly than we currently expect. Now, let's all remember that that joint venture, as evidenced by some comments that WD has made, already has aggressive plans for a 3D conversion, and progressing through the technology stack. And so there must be an underlying capital plan that supports that. And I don't have privy to exactly what it is, but it's there. And so unless that materially changes, then our view of the industry supply dynamic would remain relatively intact. And therefore there'd be much less incremental change than I think folks might fear. So that's what I would think about it at the most high level there is, is it going to change the fundamental industry supply-demand dynamics. And frankly, if an existing industry participant ends up being the ultimate acquirer. We all know how tough it is to be in this business, and so it doesn't seem like a greater likelihood that capital plans would actually be expanded and increased. Harlan Sur Question right over here. Unidentified Analyst Hi, thanks. Just with the transition to 3D NAND, you talked about the supply and demand dynamics generally as you see them now. Compared to a year ago, looking at it today, I guess expansion of 3D NAND capacity, what does that do to the overall supply dynamic you think as you look out 12 months? And what might change those assumptions? Ernie Maddock So, we have said that we believe in the long-term, and the long-term being through 2020 at this point, that you are going to have a bit demand CAGR that's in the 45% plus or minus range. As we look at the supply side of that, this year, industry participants are estimating between 30% and 40%. And again, there's been a pretty -- I think the thing that's important to remember is the consistency with which people have been talking about their estimates for bit growth. And that particular range has now been sort of inculcated for a good part of 12 months, which says that suppliers have an understanding of what they're doing, and have an understanding of what each other are doing, and therefore are able within a reasonable range of error to sort of predict that. So I would expect that you will see calendar year '18 bit supply growth to inch up, because a lot of companies are going through a 3D conversion this year. Micron went through the bulk of its conversion in our prior fiscal year, so crossing over a couple of calendar years, right. So bit supply growth is likely to expand. But bear in mind that this is an incredibly elastic market. So the rate of expansion in bit supply next year based on everything we can sort of pencil out on the back of our napkins or notebooks or whatever we do that with is still not in excess of what you would expect demand to increase by, given a normal cost curve that comes with those technology transitions. And then if you get out two or three years, and you're talking about third-generation NAND and maybe a QLC implementation, you are going to have a cost-per-bit dynamic that will really lend itself to ubiquitous replacement of HGVs even in things like desktops, where that market hasn't even begun to be tapped. And so it doesn't feel as if the opportunity is there for any sort of protracted imbalance. Now, that's not to say that in any given quarter there is going to be a little bit of a mismatch. This is not so perfectly orchestrated. But with the industry elasticity that we see, the capital investments that are our friends in the equipment business can validate. It just doesn't feel like we are on a terribly dangerous path right now as an industry. Harlan Sur Any other questions? Let's focus on the things that you and the team can control. And so you have discussed the 1x nanometer DRAM transition. You are going through that, right. I think the team's view is that this is going to be a meaningful part of the output by end of fiscal year '17, which is your August quarter, if you could give us an update there? Yields, are they are tracking towards your expectation? Do you still expected to be meaningful part of your output? And maybe if you can just go one step further and help us understand when do we see bit crossover 2x versus 1x? Ernie Maddock So, we are on track for meaningful output. We will probably talk more about when would be bit crossover a little bit later on in the fiscal year. So there is going to be no new news there. But the yields continue to be good. We are coming up the yield curve actually pretty much exactly as we would have expected to. We are also simultaneously in the back half of this year going to be rolling out 1Y node. And so one of the reasons why we haven't specifically talked about bit crossover is we want to see how those two things come along because obviously how we feel about 1Y will to some degree influence how aggressively we ramp 1x. Harlan Sur And so, it sounds like executing to plan on 1x, getting ready to bring 1Y into production second half of this year, and so far on 1Y things also tracking relative to expectations. Ernie Maddock They are absolutely. Harlan Sur Okay, great. And then again from an execution perspective doing what you say you are going to do, we all remember last year, you had a bit of a hiccup delay in qualifying your LPDDR for mobile DRAM for some of the big second half smartphone launches. Wanted to know one year later obviously we are getting ready for some big flagship smartphone ramps in the second half of this year, how have the qualifications gone this year? Ernie Maddock Qualifications are doing well while acknowledging exactly what you said that weren't qualified, we also were in the process of ramping that 20 nanometer technology node at that time. And so we knew that that window was much, much more narrow than a typical qualification window. And we didn't get across the finish line, so, no argument with that. But this year is quite different relative to that call cycle and the company's readiness for that. Harlan Sur Great. Good to hear. Let's switch over to NAND then. Again the things that you do have control over. Team is making the transition. I think it's a big transition from 32 layer to 64 layers. It's for GEN2. Again, you've discussed meaningful bit output exiting your August quarter, if you could give us an update there? Ernie Maddock So we still expect that. In terms of an absolute percentage it's actually slightly higher, but not high enough that will change the description of meaningful output. But again coming up the yield curve on that field -- feel very, very good about the implementation of 64 layer within the company. Harlan Sur And there on 3D I would say maybe relative to DRAM, I think in 3D obviously I think the team has some pretty big performance differentiators. And that's what we hear from some of your customers as it relates to performance. And so maybe you can help us understand are you -- do you continue to hear the same thing about your performance advantages? Obviously, you have a very different architecture, right, as it relates to not only just size of the chip but performance of the chip. Ernie Maddock I think it's important to understand that when somebody is consuming a NAND, right, to speak generically they are actually consuming it in the form of SSD or some other packaged solution, so, unlike a DRAM where you sell more modules with NAND.

Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Analysts Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Operator Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Level 3 Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Wednesday, February 8, 2017. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations, Ms. Valerie Finberg. Please go ahead. Valerie Finberg - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Frank. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the Level 3 Communications fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sunit Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Prior period results for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 today are presented on a pro forma basis, adjusted to reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2016 due to mergers between certain customers and other changes. Additionally, full year 2015 results have been adjusted to exclude the company's Venezuelan subsidiaries operations which were deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter 2015. Unless otherwise noted, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year and constant currency basis. All of our earnings materials, including the presentation, we will review on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website at investors.level3.com. You can see our cautionary statements beginning on page 2 of the 4Q 2016 earnings presentation, which says that the presentation and remarks contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may vary significantly from those statements. Additional information is available in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation also includes the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Valerie. And good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Throughout 2016 with our focus on profitable growth, we did a good job expanding margins, enabling us to deliver solid growth and adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. As a result, we reached a significant milestone in Level 3's history, generating over $1 billion in free cash flow in 2016. Our initiatives to improve the customer experience, particularly for interactions with our base of smaller customers began to have an effect, and we did see improvement in churn and revenue during the quarter. We are highly focused on continuing to provide a better experience for all of our customers and this remains the top initiative in 2017. Our ability to serve the complex networking needs with our largest enterprise customers continues to be a differentiator in the market for Level 3. We delivered double-digit growth from the large enterprise customers in both the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016. As we look at the market opportunity, we see customers' needs for Level 3 services continuing to grow. Whether keeping pace with the ongoing technology transitions; supporting the implementation of new digital business models; or meeting the requirement to connect to customers, employees and suppliers all over the world, increasingly CIOs need a comprehensive set of solutions to meet their networking challenges. These are the solutions Level 3 has been working hard to develop and deliver. As I've said many times, the market opportunity is there. Our ability to execute and deliver drives our growth. As you know during the fourth quarter, we announced an agreement to merge with CenturyLink. We're now well under way with the integration planning process, and as our teams work with their counterparts at CenturyLink, the excitement for the combination continues to grow. Adding Level 3's proven capabilities and growing the enterprise business, particularly for larger customers, to CenturyLink's vast network, diverse customer base, as well as their own innovative solutions will help the combined company compete for and win even more demand from customers. As you know, telecommunications is a scale business, and with the completed acquisition, we will become the second largest enterprise communications provider in the United States and one of the largest in the world. While the two companies offer many of the same products and services, each of us also brings unique capabilities and solutions to the table. It's very clear scale matters, being on net matters, having the right solution for our customers matter. The combination of our two companies expands our capabilities across all of these dimensions and enhances our ability to meet our customers' needs in a very competitive market. Per our usual process, Sunit will provide an update on our detailed results. I'll then provide commentary on what we're seeing in our regions and give some additional thoughts on the transaction. After that we'll open it up for your questions. Sunit? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I would like to start with slide 5. We exited 2016 with strong bottom line performance. We continue to expand adjusted EBITDA margin to 35.6%, which excludes CenturyLink acquisition-related expenses. This is a significant improvement from the 29.3% we saw, the quarter prior to completing the tw telecom acquisition in 2014. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11%, and we generated strong free cash flow, more than $1 billion, up from $595 million last year. For the fourth quarter, total revenue declined 0.4% while CNS revenue grew 0.2%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding UK government, grew 3.4%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multi-national enterprise customers increased 11.6%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 6.9% primarily due to continued consolidation driven disconnects. For the full year, total revenue grew 1.0% and CNS revenue grew 1.9%. Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding UK government, grew 4.8%. Wholesale CNS revenue declined 6.9% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. I'll now shift to our regional results which can be found on slide six. North America CNS revenue grew 0.8% for the fourth quarter, and from an enterprise perspective, CNS revenue grew 3.2%. On a sequential basis, North America enterprise CNS grew 1.6% compared to a sequential decline of 0.2% we saw last quarter. The improvement this quarter was due in part to changes we implemented in the second half of last year aimed at improving the overall experience for our smaller customers, along with strength from our government business. We've highlighted the sequential performance of our enterprise customer group on slide 7. Please keep in mind that revenue performance in any one of those sub-groups can fluctuate quarter to quarter. For the full year, North America CNS revenue grew 2.5% while enterprise CNS revenue increased 4.6%. Moving to EMEA. In the fourth quarter, EMEA CNS revenue decreased 7.3%, and enterprise CNS revenue excluding UK government declined 1.9%. Compared to the third quarter 2016, the pound sterling and the euro declined 5% and 6% respectively, negatively impacting reported revenue by approximately $5 million. Sequentially enterprise CNS revenue, excluding UK government grew 4.2%. As we mentioned in prior quarters, sales in the region for 2016 were quite strong, and we expect year-over-year enterprise revenue performance to strengthen in the coming quarters. For the full year 2016, total EMEA CNS revenue declined 6.1% and enterprise CNS revenue excluding UK government declined 1.1%. In Latin America, we again saw a strong enterprise performance with revenue growing 10% year-over-year. Revenue declined sequentially given the $4 million benefit from the Olympics we saw last quarter. For the full year 2016, Latin America CNS revenue increased 6.6% and enterprise CNS revenue increased 12%. Wholesale Voice Services and other or WVS revenue was $98 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, compared to $110 million from the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2016, WVS revenue declined 14% to $405 million. Moving to slide 8, from a product group perspective, IP & Data Services grew 1.7% while Transport & Fiber declined 1.6%, driven primarily by declines in private line and professional services, slightly offset by strong growth in wavelengths and dark fiber. Voice services grew 0.3%, and colocation and data services revenue declined 2.3%. Dark fiber grew 4.3% in the fourth quarter and 8.2% for the full year. CDN grew 14% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. And managed security grew 14% in the fourth quarter and 25% for the full year. Before we move on from revenue, I would like to point out that each during in the fourth quarter, we evaluate any changes that were made to customer assignments that year and adjust how we report revenue in the coming year. While these changes are minimal and do not affect our revenue mix percentages for 2017, as seen on slide nine, we have provided a pro forma schedule which can be found in our fourth quarter 2016 supplemental schedule located on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Turning to slide 10, network access margin expanded to 66.5% compared to 65.5% in the fourth quarter 2015. The improvement in network access margin was driven by continued high margin enterprise CNS revenue growth and network access cost reductions combined with low margin WVS revenue declines. Turning to slide 11, excluding CenturyLink acquisition related expenses of $15 million, adjusted EBITDA was $724 million for the fourth quarter 2016 compared to $681 million in the fourth quarter 2015, which includes $4 million of tw telecom integration-related expenses. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA grew 11% to $2.865 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 35.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016, excluding acquisition-related expenses. This compares to 33.2% in the fourth quarter of 2015 including tw integration-related expenses. As a result of our focus on both managing costs and driving profitable revenue growth, our full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA margin, excluding acquisition-related expenses, improved 330 basis points to 35.1% compared to 31.8% in 2015. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.2 times, compared to 3.8 times from the fourth quarter of 2015. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of three to four times. For the full year 2016, capital expenditures was 16% of total revenue, in line with our outlook. Turning to slide 12, excluding acquisition-related expenses, the company generated free cash flow of $266 million in the quarter, compared to $226 million from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, excluding acquisition-related expenses, the company generated $1.024 billion compared to $595 million in 2015. Our overall effective income tax rate for the full year 2016 was approximately 20%. However, during the fourth quarter, the company recognized a U.S. income tax benefit of approximately $110 million resulting from a change in U.S. tax law enacted in December 2016. Excluding this benefit, our effective tax rate would have been 33% in line with the outlook we provided for the year. As we enter 2017, we expect to move to more of a steady-state and expect our 2017 GAAP income tax rate to be approximately 38%. Turning to our business outlook for 2017 on slide 13. We are expecting full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.94 billion to $3 billion, and free cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.16 billion. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be down slightly because of typical increases in payroll taxes and a normal level of incentive expenses at the beginning of the year. In summary, as we move through 2017, we will remain focused on driving profitable revenue growth, managing our expenses tightly, generating strong free cash flow growth and getting to the lower end of our targeted net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage range of three to four times. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Sunit. Looking at our business as a whole, our focus on profitable revenue has been the core strategy behind transforming our free cash flow performance. We are a growth company. However, managing for profitable growth is what enables us to deliver the margin expansion and the bottom-line performance you've seen from Level 3. In North America, during the fourth quarter, we saw 1.6% sequential growth in our enterprise CNS revenue. We had solid growth from global accounts and a rebound in growth from our smaller accounts, who are billing less than $2,000 per month in the third quarter. We've long discussed our wedge strategy. We go into customers and we say, give us a little of your business, we'll do a good job, and then you can give us a little more. As a result of this strategy, most of our customers start as customers in that less than $2,000 per month category. However, it's also our strategy to move them out of that category and into higher spend categories with us. As a result, revenue may swing more than you would expect. This quarter revenue from this customer group grew 6% compared to the 18% decline last quarter. That's a fairly big swing. Setting aside the numbers for a minute, there are a few key learnings that come from our analysis of this customer group. First of all, our wedge strategy works. Customers start small and grow. However, we do have churn at the low end and it's a real issue for us to focus on. We are very focused on it, and we're making progress and we're improving, but we're not done yet. Overall, the market opportunity in North America remain strong and the enterprises need the solutions Level 3 provides. As an example, enterprises are actively looking to leverage the public Internet to create hybrid WAN capabilities. They want an alternative more cost effective solution that is as secure as traditional private networks that they can easily evolve as their needs evolve. As a further example, enterprises are asking for help with a desktop to data center security solution from a single managed services provider. Through Level 3 suite of security offerings and security expertise, we are poised to take advantage of these trends as well. EMEA continues to see improvement, but still with mixed results. Fourth quarter enterprise CNS revenue was down year-over-year, but up 4.2% sequentially. Year-over-year revenue comparisons suffer as a result of the disconnects that we saw at the end of 2015, while the sequential comparison on the other hand benefits from the improving sales we've discussed on previous calls, plus some seasonality and one-time items. The breadth and complexity of the solutions we are selling in EMEA are great indicators for revenue over the long term. We're making good progress within the region and expect better performance in 2017. The key metric supporting that statement is that we continued to see strong enterprise sales in the fourth quarter, with full-year enterprise sales up approximately 35% year-over-year. In Latin America, while the business environment was very challenging in much of the region, particularly in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, we were very successful in growing revenue with enterprise customers. We made progress in enhancing the customer experience and have launched additional product capabilities, such as a new DDoS scrubbing center and additional CDN capabilities in the region, which helped drive our growth. As I mentioned, we've done very well with the largest customers we target. These customers tend to be the early adopters of technology and are generally pushing the envelope on their digital business models. Our leading security capabilities, connectivity to major cloud providers, global facilities-based network and advanced networking solutions are exactly what those customers are looking for to address their communications challenges. When we think about those capabilities and how they will evolve after the combination with CenturyLink, we believe we will be in an even better position to solve our customers' needs. For the largest customers, CenturyLink has a number of advanced product and service capabilities that will enhance the solutions we provide today. Adding the Level 3 network into the expansive CenturyLink network enables the combined company to provide more robust and profitable on-net solutions across the globe. While the combined company is committed to providing excellent service to consumers and we think this acquisition will benefit consumers as well, 76% of the company's revenue will be focused on wireline enterprise and wholesale communications. That is a sharp focus on these customers, especially compared to our largest competitors. Level 3 has struggled over the last year with small customers. CenturyLink has products and a support model that resonate with this customer base. We believe combining the expertise of both companies across enterprise, wholesale and consumer customers, is a natural fit. The combined company's broad product portfolio, extensive network reach and complementary service models positions us well to serve our customers' need in a way that neither of us could do alone. Beyond the benefit for customers, this transaction continues to be compelling from a financial perspective. For example, the transaction brings the Level 3 enterprise growth engine to the CenturyLink platform. It enables faster monetization of the Level 3 NOLs, and is significantly accretive to free cash flow. On this last point, you've heard me say repeatedly before that I firmly believe that improving free cash flow per share is key to delivering stockholder value. This transaction does that. Until the acquisition closes, Level 3 is dedicated to serving our customers well and competing fiercely in the marketplace. Our customer experience is the core of what we offer and the better we serve customers every step of the way, the more we can grow with their evolving needs. As I said earlier, we are focused on improving the customer experience and driving profitable growth in 2017. After the acquisition closes, I am looking forward to joining the CenturyLink board of directors. Until then, I'm highly engaged with Glen and the Level 3 management team in developing a combined strategy and assuring that the right structure is in place to achieve our goals. We will now open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to go back and spend a little more time on the improvement we saw this quarter in North American CNS enterprise revenue. I know that you noted it can be a little bit of choppy at a segment level when you break it down to customers, but you certainly seem like you're getting few things right. So, the question will be, first, can you just kind of recap for us some of the initiatives that you have in place and that started to moving the numbers in the right direction? And as an extension to that, are you seeing any competitive response? And then just at a higher level, knowing this can be a little bit of a volatile line item from quarter-to-quarter, what do you think is the right framework for investors to think about the trajectory on a sequential basis of that overall segment as we move into the close later this year? Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. So, I'll take the first two, and then I'll let Sunit talk about the trajectory. Brett, from a competitive perspective and whether the competitive responses we see, we have long said that our success depends on our ability to execute, and I still believe that. When we do our job correctly, we're going to win in the marketplace. Our products and services are very robust and meet the needs of customers, our network footprint is expansive, and we're able to do on-net in a large percentage of the cases. So when we do our job properly, I'm not that worried about what the competitive response is. We continue to win with our customers, because we do better than our competitors. Some of those actions – and I can go into as much or as little detail as you want on this, but we've done a lot of things, and a lot of them are basic blocking and tackling. Everything from making sure we're providing a great service assurance experience, to making sure that we have good account coverage. And as we integrated tw telecom, making sure that every account has a name associated with it and that employee is calling that account and working with that account and making sure that we're driving the products and services that we want. We also need to do – we've done a better job of making sure that we're selling the advanced services to our competitors' customers. We want to take customers and win them and bring them to the Level 3 network. So we're focused on new logo acquisition. Again, we start small with them and then we grow them in that using our wedge strategy, but it's a key part of our business plan is to make sure that we continue to add new logos as we go along. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. In terms of trajectory going forward, look, we're not providing any specific revenue guidance for 2017, but in general we hope to drive better performance on the revenue side in 2017 compared to 2016. I think that the growth in the – the sequential growth in the enterprise segment for North America is pretty good this quarter. As Jeff pointed out, it will fluctuate, and we just – the initiatives we have are working through. So I would say that, hopefully, as with every passing quarter, that will be better and we're just pushing on sales making sure we keep the churn down, improving the customer experience. So no specific guidance per se, but just overall we are hoping to drive a little better performance in 2017 on the revenue side compared to 2016. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. I appreciate the color and I'll parse (25:16) just a little bit, because you did have two quarters last year that we saw sequential declines. Are you comfortable enough with where you are that you think you can grow sequentially, without putting a number on it, each quarter this year? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah, I mean, in general, we don't expect sequential declines for North America enterprise. But, again, it's tough to predict. In any given quarter there's enough things moving around. But I'll say, yeah, in general, as I said, we expect to drive overall better performance this year than last year. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And you always have heard us say, Brett, it is never linear, and it's not going to be linear going forward. But – just to add that to Sunit's comment. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. Well, thanks for taking the question. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks for the color on North America enterprise. I think wholesale weakness you attributed to consolidation in the industry. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how that plays out in 2017? Is that a similar pressure to 2016? Is that going to abate a little bit? And then, on datacenters and colocation dropping about 2% and a number of carriers look to sell their datacenter assets, is that something that – obviously, you've got the merger coming up. But is that something where you think you can turn that around and make it a growth business, or might there be some opportunities post deal close to look at that portfolio? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. All right. So, let me at least cover performance for that, and then – because the story is a little different by region. So for datacenters in general, our business is doing well. In Latin America it's growing. The weakness is in EMEA and in North America. And I would say that we're not looking to exit our datacenter business. We generally get at least 3X bandwidth attached revenues to our datacenter revenues, so we are happy with it. It is profitable. The colocation business, as we call it, those facilities sit where our gateway facilities are for Level 3's core network, so really tough to look at separating or selling, so no plans to do that. And so I think that, we're just pushing to drive better performance. We do have spare capacity in EMEA. In North America, capacity for datacenter is different in different facilities. And in Latin America, we're generally investing capital to expand our datacenter footprint, and it's a nice growing business. On the wholesale side, yes, we expect to see the weakness, if you like. And then it's not weakness per se. I would say we've said for quite some time that we expect the wholesale business to decline slightly every year. So in some years it might decline a little more or less, but in general we expect the wholesale business to decline slightly every year. I don't think that 2017 will be any different. I mean, we might see different things by different regions, but in general I would say we think it will be a similar story in 2017 to what we saw in 2016. Jeff... Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. And are there any more synergies to come out of the tw telecom deal or is that pretty much played out at this point? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I think it's pretty much played out at this point. Having said that, and to just reiterate what Jeff talked about and what I mentioned in my comments, we are managing our expenses very tightly in 2017. I mean, we really stay focused very hard on driving high incremental margins. So I would say that it was not synergy related per se, but just making sure we are managing very, very tight on the expenses. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And it's not just managing tight, although we do that. It's also changing the way we operate. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. We believe that becoming more efficient and more effective every single year is a mandate in our business. And so that we are very, very focused and always making sure that we make it easier every year for our employees to do their jobs, give them better tools, give them better environment, and make it simpler. Every time we do that, that lowers our cost. And so they're not really related to tw integration, but they are related to – we will expect improvements in the way that we provide our services to customers. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. And we continue to progress on that. I mean, over the last year, for example, we're now in one single billing platform in 60 countries, one single ERP system in all those counties. We'll be on one supply chain system by the end of second quarter on all 60 countries. So I think driving that kind of platform consolidation and common management reporting framework really gives you a lot of benefits, as Jeff said in terms of making lives easier for employees. There are, obviously, other things, there are still opportunities for us to work on that we look forward to with the CenturyLink combination, the area of order entry to service delivery, and network inventory that will be work in progress, but future improvement opportunities for us. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Please proceed. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. A couple, if I may. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the competitive landscape for the enterprise CNS business. I mean clearly, we saw improvement this quarter. There have been some competitors talking about the competitive environment has been pretty healthy. And then I guess the bigger picture question from our standpoint is, if we take some of the execution capabilities that you folks have, what comfort do you have in terms of the ability to drive that execution through the combined entity with CenturyLink going forward? If we look at some of their enterprise execution, admittedly, it had fallen a little bit below where they had anticipated, so just trying to understand sort of the bigger picture there. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. From a competitive landscape, we think there is a very robust competitive market out there, and for enterprise customers in particular. And so there is a very competitive environment. We succeed well in that competitive environment, because we meet the challenges and the needs of our customers. Our products and services meet those needs. We focus on their networking challenges and how they interface during the different aspects of their business together. We do a good job with our customer experience from the time we start quoting an order until we turn it up, till we manage it, till we bill for it. Some of the simplifications that we've done over the last couple of years, the billing system that Sunit referenced in 60 countries, we will look at every step of the customer journey and the every interaction they have with Level 3, and say, how do we improve that. And so the competitive environment is strong, but we think that we're a strong competitor in there because we differentiate ourselves for our customers. From an execution perspective, both CenturyLink and Level 3 have a fairly long history of acquiring companies, and both of us have a fairly good track record of executing. And so I expect, through the combined efforts and all the integration planning that will go on, that we will come up with a very good execution plan and an integration plan that will make sure that we continue to focus on doing exactly what I said, providing a differentiated customer experience, putting our products together in a way that creates a broad portfolio of solutions that our customers can use to satisfy their networking challenges, and just continue to deliver. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Excellent. Thanks very much. And then if I may, one quick follow-up. Since the announcement of the transaction, can you provide us with any color in terms of feedback that you've received from customers regarding sort of the prospects of both companies coming together? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. I mean, first of all, customers are positive about it, but they're also anxious about it. What does this mean? How are you going to continue to execute? And what does it mean from an opportunity for us to have diversity? And so we talk through those issues with our customers, and we spend a lot of time talking about them. We have one of the best sales forces in the industry. And so they are very good at explaining what our products and services are, how we design our networks, and what our capabilities are and make sure that we address their concerns and whatever challenges they see. In general, customers have been positive about it. We'll certainly see every now and then a customer wanting to use this to leverage one of us against the other, and until we close, we'll remain furious competitors. And we win, Level 3 wins, when Level 3 performs the best and that's what we're going to remain focused on doing. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks very much for the incremental color. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, thanks. Jeff, you used to talk about 2% sequential growth as a goal for enterprise. I recognize this is no longer something you talk about a ton. But is it still a fair internal goal, or has the environment changed to impact that potential? And second, is there any reduction in your CapEx from sort of a normal run rate as you prepare for the CTL merger? Thank you. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. So, I'll take the first one and then I will let Sunit talk about the CapEx. We aren't talking about that externally anymore. And part of the reason is, when you talk about internal goals and internal expectations and things we set for our own team externally, they somehow become external expectations. And so, we don't talk about that as much. What we do internally is we stretch our organization. We talk about how do we satisfy our customers' needs better. And when we do that, we can win more than our fair share. We can win disproportionately. If we satisfy our customers better than everybody else, we will win more than everybody else. And so, we set aggressive targets internally. We set aggressive expectations internally. We think we, again, have the best sales force. We think we have the best service delivery and the best service assurance teams and we ask them to deliver better than the market would indicate. And so, we'll continue to really press ourselves internally, but we don't talk about those internal targets externally anymore. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can I ask it a different way? Has the market changed? Has your view of the potential of the market changed in the last 6 to 12 months in a way that things have gotten worse as you look at your business? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. No. I think that our ability – the market's there. And all of the trends that I've talked about over the last couple of years, and customers becoming more global, more based on new technologies and new digital business models, all of those things are continuing to come true. Our ability to set our products in front of those trends is continuing – we're continuing to meet the challenge there, as well. And so, all of the things that I've talked about, about where the market's going over the last couple of years, where our capabilities are going, and our ability to meet those, remain true. Now, again, in answer to a question earlier, these things are never linear, but we think we do a pretty good job of capturing the demand and working with our customers. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. I mean, in summary, our market share is still pretty low and so there's plenty of market share to gain. We have a fantastic facilities footprint. We just have to make sure we do a uniformly good job of customer experience, everything from coding to turning up service to service assurance to billing, and that's where we're focused on. On the capital question, we continue to invest and grow our capital expenditures. So last year, we increased our outlook, which generally we had been running at about 15% of revenues to 16% of revenues. And we are maintaining that again this year at 16%. So that means even in 2017, we'll be spending more capital than we did last year. So I think we are investing aggressively, not just for success-based capital, making sure we're making the right investments to provide the platform for future growth. One specific example I mentioned earlier was the data center investments in Latin America, for example. So we continue to do that. Extending our fiber footprint in all regions, connecting more on-net buildings. I think those investments will continue pace again in 2017. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks very much, guys. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Phil. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company Great. Thank you. Two questions if I may. When you look at the 0% or excuse me, the negative 0.2% sequential growth we saw in the third quarter compared to the 1.6% growth we just saw in the fourth quarter in North American enterprise, is there a way to kind of talk about how much of that you would attribute to typical seasonality versus fundamental improvement regarding some of the issues that you wanted to work through? My thought is that typically we see a pop in sequential growth in the fourth quarter for seasonal reasons, although I recognize last year that wasn't the case. And then the second question is, you mentioned that all of your guidance for 2017 excludes CTL acquisition related expenses. Can you give us an estimate of what those CTL acquisition-related expenses are expected to be? Thanks. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. So, glad you asked the second question because our guidance, obviously, excludes any integration related expenses. I don't have an estimate or guidance for that. I think we will disclose that every quarter as we go along as we have in previous transactions, so no specific guidance to that. We'll just disclose it every quarter as we incur those expenses. On the enterprise revenue growth in the fourth quarter, as we talked about over the last year or so, the seasonality in the fourth quarter has become less pronounced. It used to be when our Vyvx video business was more of a factor but as we bought tw telecom and number of years ago Global Crossing, the fourth quarter seasonality has become less pronounced. In addition, keep in mind, we also got some benefit in the third quarter from the Olympics. So if you factor that in, there's really not much in the way of seasonal pickup in the fourth quarter. So as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by better performance at the lower end of the customer base and some extra strength in the government business, so that's what's driving it. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company And just going back to that first question, obviously, the costs were $15 million this quarter. Is that I guess a decent proxy for us to kind of put into our model since obviously it would be some type of cost at least for now? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I don't know. But you can. There will be some costs but it's tough to be too specific. It will fluctuate because as we go through some of these integration planning activities and we try to get a jump on some of the synergy work ahead of time, both CenturyLink and us will be incurring expenses, so it's really tough to kind of opine until we figure out what (41:11) Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company Okay. Thank you, Sunit. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. First, regarding your 2017 outlook, how would you describe your level of confidence in the outlook relative to years passed given the amount of turbulence that you've had in the business as of late? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. I think we feel very confident about the outlook. I mean, obviously, we've spent a lot of time thinking about it and we're quite confident. And I think that when you look at our performance with respect to bottom line outlook numbers, we've generally been very good and I would say our confidence is high and strong. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. Great. And second, Jeff, I think in your earlier comments, you mentioned something about customers, perhaps, becoming more interested in moving away from like IP VPN towards solutions that go over the public Internet. If I'm not mistaken, IP VPN has been a big driver of your IP & Data Services segment historically. Is there any price risk in that trend or do you think it would be additive? Maybe you can talk about that. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. So it's not exactly moving away from IP VPN to public IP. It's a trend of moving to hybrid networking where they're going to be – there is a mix in the customers' needs portfolio. If you think about a customer, they're going to have some of their data centers that they own and operate. Some of the data centers are going to be in and some provider, but they still own and operate the equipment. Some data centers are going to be on a cloud network. Sometimes they're going to want to connect to regional office. Each one of those applications is a different type of networking. If it's two data centers and they're in the same market and they're owned and operated, you want to tie those together with dark fiber. If it's a data center, they're distributed by 100, 200, 300 miles, you want to tie those together with wave services. If it's into a cloud provider, maybe you want IP VPN, so you have dedicated services. When it's going out to a branch office, a big branch office, it's IP VPN everyone is going to – in your employees' homes, it's just IP. The point is they want a hybrid network and our products and our solutions satisfy those hybrid networking challenges. And so yeah, there will be more IP solutions, but it will be part of an overall solution for the customer that brings all of those capabilities together, based on the individual needs and the individual application for that customer. And so, yeah, there are some pricing challenges associated with it, but I think overall, it's additive and gives us a greater opportunity to serve more customers. Sunit already touched on the fact that we have relatively low market share. It gives us more opportunity to serve more customers, more broadly with broader product portfolio. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. That's great. That's super helpful color, Jeff. Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Thank you, Nick. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you. Can you talk to us about the sales force, what was the count of quota-bearing heads at the end of the year and what's the churn been there? And then, has there been any particular churn from different customer groups and so forth that might have impacted the growth rate? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. So while we're looking at the specific numbers for the sales force, let me just talk about, is there any churn. There's always a little bit of churn in our sales force. And if you look at the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2016, that churn wasn't substantially different among our sales team, and in the first quarter, we tend to add some people. So there's some seasonality to all of that. We pay very close attention to it and we haven't seen anything in the churn of our sales team that's causing us alarm or anxiety. (45:21) Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. It's pretty stable. I mean, if you look at the sales force at the end of the fourth quarter, it was 1,140; year ago, it was 1,150. And as Jeff mentioned, I know that we've already added sales people in January, so I know we're already above the 1,150 mark we had at the fourth quarter of 2015, so it's pretty stable. We don't really see any issues. The key is focused in them on productivity improvement. And as we have successfully been able to do that for the last couple of years. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And if you look over the next nine months until the close of the CenturyLink transaction and beyond, we will be very focused on maintaining our sales team. And we know the number one thing we can do to maintain them is make them productive. The more productivity they have, the more money they make, the happier they are, the longer they stay. And so Sunit is right, our focus is on making sure that we are creating the opportunity for our sales team to be very productive and drive sales forward. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Got it. And any other churn from any other aspects of your customer base or other verticals or anything that might have impacted the growth in the quarter? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. No. I think churn came down, actually, from the last couple of quarters. So we were running around 1.3%, that sort of percent and this quarter we're 1.1%, so it actually came down. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And I believe we have one more question in the queue. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two questions, just to follow up on the churn. Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned you still thought there was some room to go. Sunit, you just mentioned you're sort of back to that 1.1% level, which is where you were before the last couple of quarters. So, maybe just talk a little bit about how much more room for improvement you may have? And also just, as you look at that low to mid-end, I wonder if you're willing to share with us, sort of what percentage of that revenue is off-net versus on-net presumably a lot more focused on retaining that on-net than you are the off-net at this time? And then just a second question, on business activity, obviously a lot of discussion amidst the change in administration in Washington around tax reform, regulatory reform. Jeff, I wonder if you can comment on whether or not you're seeing businesses react either positively or negatively as they face some of the uncertainty around timing and what the reforms may be? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. First of all, my comments on churn were about the low end that I spoke, I think we have room to go on the low end. I want to reduce churn across every customer that we have. And until we have the best customer experience, I still think that we have room to grow and room to improve. So we will continue to focus on providing the best customer experience. We'll continue to focus on looking at things like how do we renew better, when do we go and talk to customers about renewals, and how do we do a better job of satisfying an existing customer's needs for extended services. And so my comments were around the low end in particular. I won't quantify how much improvement we have. But I think we can do better. I seriously think we can do better. And that's a relatively small piece of our overall business. But I think we can do better across those customers and across all of our enterprise customers, so we'll continue to focus on that. I don't have a good sense of how much of that is on-net versus off-net. Sunit, I don't know if you do, but I don't have a good sense off the top of my head of on-net versus off-net. I tell you you're right in your assumption that I'd rather save an on-net customer than an off-net customer. But that also creates opportunities for us as we look at the CenturyLink transaction. There are customers today that are off-net to one of us that we can move to on-net, and that gives us an opportunity to capture network synergies, but it gives us an opportunity to provide a better experience to the customer. And so, that's part of the value of the combination. With respect to regulatory reform, I do think that there are a lot of people out there that are wondering what's going on. If you look at our healthcare customers, there's a lot of anxiety around what new rules and things are going to be. But I don't see that affecting their view of their bandwidth needs or their view of their networking challenges. And so we haven't seen anything in particular. It obviously comes up in a lot of conversations with customers, but we haven't seen the change in buying patterns. We haven't seen people saying no, I'm going to hold off, I'm waiting to hear what the administration does about this or about that. I think most people that we're dealing with, save the government customers, put them aside. Most of the people that we're dealing with are moving forward with the network plans and the IT expansions, and things that they've had going. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah, we don't see any change in that. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And then on your question, the tax side, look, it's still too early to know what is being contemplated and if it's going to pass, when. So really tough to comment on that at this stage. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. So that was the last question that we had in the queue, so I'd like to end the call with a few thoughts. First of all, profitable growth continues to be a driving force in how we operate our business, and we believe our ongoing focus here enables us to continue to grow free cash flow and free cash flow per share in 2017. We are laser focused on improving the experience for our customers across the interactions they have with Level 3. Providing a differentiated customer experience is a key driver of our success in growing revenue. I shared this many times before that our vision is to be the trusted connection to the networked world. We firmly believe that the CenturyLink transaction is the next step in the evolution of that vision and will enable us to deliver an even better experience to our customers, while providing value to our stockholders. As always, thank you for joining today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call. Operator Thank you, Jeff.

Our first question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking the question. I'd like to go back and spend a little more time on the improvement we saw this quarter in North American CNS enterprise revenue. I know that you noted it can be a little bit of choppy at a segment level when you break it down to customers, but you certainly seem like you're getting few things right. So, the question will be, first, can you just kind of recap for us some of the initiatives that you have in place and that started to moving the numbers in the right direction? And as an extension to that, are you seeing any competitive response? And then just at a higher level, knowing this can be a little bit of a volatile line item from quarter-to-quarter, what do you think is the right framework for investors to think about the trajectory on a sequential basis of that overall segment as we move into the close later this year? Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. So, I'll take the first two, and then I'll let Sunit talk about the trajectory. Brett, from a competitive perspective and whether the competitive responses we see, we have long said that our success depends on our ability to execute, and I still believe that. When we do our job correctly, we're going to win in the marketplace. Our products and services are very robust and meet the needs of customers, our network footprint is expansive, and we're able to do on-net in a large percentage of the cases. So when we do our job properly, I'm not that worried about what the competitive response is. We continue to win with our customers, because we do better than our competitors. Some of those actions – and I can go into as much or as little detail as you want on this, but we've done a lot of things, and a lot of them are basic blocking and tackling. Everything from making sure we're providing a great service assurance experience, to making sure that we have good account coverage. And as we integrated tw telecom, making sure that every account has a name associated with it and that employee is calling that account and working with that account and making sure that we're driving the products and services that we want. We also need to do – we've done a better job of making sure that we're selling the advanced services to our competitors' customers. We want to take customers and win them and bring them to the Level 3 network. So we're focused on new logo acquisition. Again, we start small with them and then we grow them in that using our wedge strategy, but it's a key part of our business plan is to make sure that we continue to add new logos as we go along. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. In terms of trajectory going forward, look, we're not providing any specific revenue guidance for 2017, but in general we hope to drive better performance on the revenue side in 2017 compared to 2016. I think that the growth in the – the sequential growth in the enterprise segment for North America is pretty good this quarter. As Jeff pointed out, it will fluctuate, and we just – the initiatives we have are working through. So I would say that, hopefully, as with every passing quarter, that will be better and we're just pushing on sales making sure we keep the churn down, improving the customer experience. So no specific guidance per se, but just overall we are hoping to drive a little better performance in 2017 on the revenue side compared to 2016. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. I appreciate the color and I'll parse (25:16) just a little bit, because you did have two quarters last year that we saw sequential declines. Are you comfortable enough with where you are that you think you can grow sequentially, without putting a number on it, each quarter this year? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah, I mean, in general, we don't expect sequential declines for North America enterprise. But, again, it's tough to predict. In any given quarter there's enough things moving around. But I'll say, yeah, in general, as I said, we expect to drive overall better performance this year than last year. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And you always have heard us say, Brett, it is never linear, and it's not going to be linear going forward. But – just to add that to Sunit's comment. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. Well, thanks for taking the question. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you very much. Yeah, thanks for the color on North America enterprise. I think wholesale weakness you attributed to consolidation in the industry. Can you just give us a little bit of color on how that plays out in 2017? Is that a similar pressure to 2016? Is that going to abate a little bit? And then, on datacenters and colocation dropping about 2% and a number of carriers look to sell their datacenter assets, is that something that – obviously, you've got the merger coming up. But is that something where you think you can turn that around and make it a growth business, or might there be some opportunities post deal close to look at that portfolio? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. All right. So, let me at least cover performance for that, and then – because the story is a little different by region. So for datacenters in general, our business is doing well. In Latin America it's growing. The weakness is in EMEA and in North America. And I would say that we're not looking to exit our datacenter business. We generally get at least 3X bandwidth attached revenues to our datacenter revenues, so we are happy with it. It is profitable. The colocation business, as we call it, those facilities sit where our gateway facilities are for Level 3's core network, so really tough to look at separating or selling, so no plans to do that. And so I think that, we're just pushing to drive better performance. We do have spare capacity in EMEA. In North America, capacity for datacenter is different in different facilities. And in Latin America, we're generally investing capital to expand our datacenter footprint, and it's a nice growing business. On the wholesale side, yes, we expect to see the weakness, if you like. And then it's not weakness per se. I would say we've said for quite some time that we expect the wholesale business to decline slightly every year. So in some years it might decline a little more or less, but in general we expect the wholesale business to decline slightly every year. I don't think that 2017 will be any different. I mean, we might see different things by different regions, but in general I would say we think it will be a similar story in 2017 to what we saw in 2016. Jeff... Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. And are there any more synergies to come out of the tw telecom deal or is that pretty much played out at this point? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I think it's pretty much played out at this point. Having said that, and to just reiterate what Jeff talked about and what I mentioned in my comments, we are managing our expenses very tightly in 2017. I mean, we really stay focused very hard on driving high incremental margins. So I would say that it was not synergy related per se, but just making sure we are managing very, very tight on the expenses. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And it's not just managing tight, although we do that. It's also changing the way we operate. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. We believe that becoming more efficient and more effective every single year is a mandate in our business. And so that we are very, very focused and always making sure that we make it easier every year for our employees to do their jobs, give them better tools, give them better environment, and make it simpler. Every time we do that, that lowers our cost. And so they're not really related to tw integration, but they are related to – we will expect improvements in the way that we provide our services to customers. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. And we continue to progress on that. I mean, over the last year, for example, we're now in one single billing platform in 60 countries, one single ERP system in all those counties. We'll be on one supply chain system by the end of second quarter on all 60 countries. So I think driving that kind of platform consolidation and common management reporting framework really gives you a lot of benefits, as Jeff said in terms of making lives easier for employees. There are, obviously, other things, there are still opportunities for us to work on that we look forward to with the CenturyLink combination, the area of order entry to service delivery, and network inventory that will be work in progress, but future improvement opportunities for us. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Please proceed. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. A couple, if I may. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about the competitive landscape for the enterprise CNS business. I mean clearly, we saw improvement this quarter. There have been some competitors talking about the competitive environment has been pretty healthy. And then I guess the bigger picture question from our standpoint is, if we take some of the execution capabilities that you folks have, what comfort do you have in terms of the ability to drive that execution through the combined entity with CenturyLink going forward? If we look at some of their enterprise execution, admittedly, it had fallen a little bit below where they had anticipated, so just trying to understand sort of the bigger picture there. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. From a competitive landscape, we think there is a very robust competitive market out there, and for enterprise customers in particular. And so there is a very competitive environment. We succeed well in that competitive environment, because we meet the challenges and the needs of our customers. Our products and services meet those needs. We focus on their networking challenges and how they interface during the different aspects of their business together. We do a good job with our customer experience from the time we start quoting an order until we turn it up, till we manage it, till we bill for it. Some of the simplifications that we've done over the last couple of years, the billing system that Sunit referenced in 60 countries, we will look at every step of the customer journey and the every interaction they have with Level 3, and say, how do we improve that. And so the competitive environment is strong, but we think that we're a strong competitor in there because we differentiate ourselves for our customers. From an execution perspective, both CenturyLink and Level 3 have a fairly long history of acquiring companies, and both of us have a fairly good track record of executing. And so I expect, through the combined efforts and all the integration planning that will go on, that we will come up with a very good execution plan and an integration plan that will make sure that we continue to focus on doing exactly what I said, providing a differentiated customer experience, putting our products together in a way that creates a broad portfolio of solutions that our customers can use to satisfy their networking challenges, and just continue to deliver. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Excellent. Thanks very much. And then if I may, one quick follow-up. Since the announcement of the transaction, can you provide us with any color in terms of feedback that you've received from customers regarding sort of the prospects of both companies coming together? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. I mean, first of all, customers are positive about it, but they're also anxious about it. What does this mean? How are you going to continue to execute? And what does it mean from an opportunity for us to have diversity? And so we talk through those issues with our customers, and we spend a lot of time talking about them. We have one of the best sales forces in the industry. And so they are very good at explaining what our products and services are, how we design our networks, and what our capabilities are and make sure that we address their concerns and whatever challenges they see. In general, customers have been positive about it. We'll certainly see every now and then a customer wanting to use this to leverage one of us against the other, and until we close, we'll remain furious competitors. And we win, Level 3 wins, when Level 3 performs the best and that's what we're going to remain focused on doing. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thanks very much for the incremental color. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi, thanks. Jeff, you used to talk about 2% sequential growth as a goal for enterprise. I recognize this is no longer something you talk about a ton. But is it still a fair internal goal, or has the environment changed to impact that potential? And second, is there any reduction in your CapEx from sort of a normal run rate as you prepare for the CTL merger? Thank you. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. So, I'll take the first one and then I will let Sunit talk about the CapEx. We aren't talking about that externally anymore. And part of the reason is, when you talk about internal goals and internal expectations and things we set for our own team externally, they somehow become external expectations. And so, we don't talk about that as much. What we do internally is we stretch our organization. We talk about how do we satisfy our customers' needs better. And when we do that, we can win more than our fair share. We can win disproportionately. If we satisfy our customers better than everybody else, we will win more than everybody else. And so, we set aggressive targets internally. We set aggressive expectations internally. We think we, again, have the best sales force. We think we have the best service delivery and the best service assurance teams and we ask them to deliver better than the market would indicate. And so, we'll continue to really press ourselves internally, but we don't talk about those internal targets externally anymore. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Can I ask it a different way? Has the market changed? Has your view of the potential of the market changed in the last 6 to 12 months in a way that things have gotten worse as you look at your business? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. No. I think that our ability – the market's there. And all of the trends that I've talked about over the last couple of years, and customers becoming more global, more based on new technologies and new digital business models, all of those things are continuing to come true. Our ability to set our products in front of those trends is continuing – we're continuing to meet the challenge there, as well. And so, all of the things that I've talked about, about where the market's going over the last couple of years, where our capabilities are going, and our ability to meet those, remain true. Now, again, in answer to a question earlier, these things are never linear, but we think we do a pretty good job of capturing the demand and working with our customers. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. I mean, in summary, our market share is still pretty low and so there's plenty of market share to gain. We have a fantastic facilities footprint. We just have to make sure we do a uniformly good job of customer experience, everything from coding to turning up service to service assurance to billing, and that's where we're focused on. On the capital question, we continue to invest and grow our capital expenditures. So last year, we increased our outlook, which generally we had been running at about 15% of revenues to 16% of revenues. And we are maintaining that again this year at 16%. So that means even in 2017, we'll be spending more capital than we did last year. So I think we are investing aggressively, not just for success-based capital, making sure we're making the right investments to provide the platform for future growth. One specific example I mentioned earlier was the data center investments in Latin America, for example. So we continue to do that. Extending our fiber footprint in all regions, connecting more on-net buildings. I think those investments will continue pace again in 2017. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks very much, guys. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Phil. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen and Company. Please proceed. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company Great. Thank you. Two questions if I may. When you look at the 0% or excuse me, the negative 0.2% sequential growth we saw in the third quarter compared to the 1.6% growth we just saw in the fourth quarter in North American enterprise, is there a way to kind of talk about how much of that you would attribute to typical seasonality versus fundamental improvement regarding some of the issues that you wanted to work through? My thought is that typically we see a pop in sequential growth in the fourth quarter for seasonal reasons, although I recognize last year that wasn't the case. And then the second question is, you mentioned that all of your guidance for 2017 excludes CTL acquisition related expenses. Can you give us an estimate of what those CTL acquisition-related expenses are expected to be? Thanks. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. So, glad you asked the second question because our guidance, obviously, excludes any integration related expenses. I don't have an estimate or guidance for that. I think we will disclose that every quarter as we go along as we have in previous transactions, so no specific guidance to that. We'll just disclose it every quarter as we incur those expenses. On the enterprise revenue growth in the fourth quarter, as we talked about over the last year or so, the seasonality in the fourth quarter has become less pronounced. It used to be when our Vyvx video business was more of a factor but as we bought tw telecom and number of years ago Global Crossing, the fourth quarter seasonality has become less pronounced. In addition, keep in mind, we also got some benefit in the third quarter from the Olympics. So if you factor that in, there's really not much in the way of seasonal pickup in the fourth quarter. So as I mentioned in my comments, it's driven by better performance at the lower end of the customer base and some extra strength in the government business, so that's what's driving it. Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company And just going back to that first question, obviously, the costs were $15 million this quarter. Is that I guess a decent proxy for us to kind of put into our model since obviously it would be some type of cost at least for now? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I don't know. But you can. There will be some costs but it's tough to be too specific. It will fluctuate because as we go through some of these integration planning activities and we try to get a jump on some of the synergy work ahead of time, both CenturyLink and us will be incurring expenses, so it's really tough to kind of opine until we figure out what (41:11) Colby Synesael - Cowen and Company Okay. Thank you, Sunit. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. Hey, thanks for taking my questions. First, regarding your 2017 outlook, how would you describe your level of confidence in the outlook relative to years passed given the amount of turbulence that you've had in the business as of late? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. I think we feel very confident about the outlook. I mean, obviously, we've spent a lot of time thinking about it and we're quite confident. And I think that when you look at our performance with respect to bottom line outlook numbers, we've generally been very good and I would say our confidence is high and strong. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. Great. And second, Jeff, I think in your earlier comments, you mentioned something about customers, perhaps, becoming more interested in moving away from like IP VPN towards solutions that go over the public Internet. If I'm not mistaken, IP VPN has been a big driver of your IP & Data Services segment historically. Is there any price risk in that trend or do you think it would be additive? Maybe you can talk about that. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. So it's not exactly moving away from IP VPN to public IP. It's a trend of moving to hybrid networking where they're going to be – there is a mix in the customers' needs portfolio. If you think about a customer, they're going to have some of their data centers that they own and operate. Some of the data centers are going to be in and some provider, but they still own and operate the equipment. Some data centers are going to be on a cloud network. Sometimes they're going to want to connect to regional office. Each one of those applications is a different type of networking. If it's two data centers and they're in the same market and they're owned and operated, you want to tie those together with dark fiber. If it's a data center, they're distributed by 100, 200, 300 miles, you want to tie those together with wave services. If it's into a cloud provider, maybe you want IP VPN, so you have dedicated services. When it's going out to a branch office, a big branch office, it's IP VPN everyone is going to – in your employees' homes, it's just IP. The point is they want a hybrid network and our products and our solutions satisfy those hybrid networking challenges. And so yeah, there will be more IP solutions, but it will be part of an overall solution for the customer that brings all of those capabilities together, based on the individual needs and the individual application for that customer. And so, yeah, there are some pricing challenges associated with it, but I think overall, it's additive and gives us a greater opportunity to serve more customers. Sunit already touched on the fact that we have relatively low market share. It gives us more opportunity to serve more customers, more broadly with broader product portfolio. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. That's great. That's super helpful color, Jeff. Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Thank you, Nick. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you. Can you talk to us about the sales force, what was the count of quota-bearing heads at the end of the year and what's the churn been there? And then, has there been any particular churn from different customer groups and so forth that might have impacted the growth rate? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. So while we're looking at the specific numbers for the sales force, let me just talk about, is there any churn. There's always a little bit of churn in our sales force. And if you look at the fourth quarter of 2015 versus the fourth quarter of 2016, that churn wasn't substantially different among our sales team, and in the first quarter, we tend to add some people. So there's some seasonality to all of that. We pay very close attention to it and we haven't seen anything in the churn of our sales team that's causing us alarm or anxiety. (45:21) Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. It's pretty stable. I mean, if you look at the sales force at the end of the fourth quarter, it was 1,140; year ago, it was 1,150. And as Jeff mentioned, I know that we've already added sales people in January, so I know we're already above the 1,150 mark we had at the fourth quarter of 2015, so it's pretty stable. We don't really see any issues. The key is focused in them on productivity improvement. And as we have successfully been able to do that for the last couple of years. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And if you look over the next nine months until the close of the CenturyLink transaction and beyond, we will be very focused on maintaining our sales team. And we know the number one thing we can do to maintain them is make them productive. The more productivity they have, the more money they make, the happier they are, the longer they stay. And so Sunit is right, our focus is on making sure that we are creating the opportunity for our sales team to be very productive and drive sales forward. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Got it. And any other churn from any other aspects of your customer base or other verticals or anything that might have impacted the growth in the quarter? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. No. I think churn came down, actually, from the last couple of quarters. So we were running around 1.3%, that sort of percent and this quarter we're 1.1%, so it actually came down. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And I believe we have one more question in the queue. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two questions, just to follow up on the churn. Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned you still thought there was some room to go. Sunit, you just mentioned you're sort of back to that 1.1% level, which is where you were before the last couple of quarters. So, maybe just talk a little bit about how much more room for improvement you may have? And also just, as you look at that low to mid-end, I wonder if you're willing to share with us, sort of what percentage of that revenue is off-net versus on-net presumably a lot more focused on retaining that on-net than you are the off-net at this time? And then just a second question, on business activity, obviously a lot of discussion amidst the change in administration in Washington around tax reform, regulatory reform. Jeff, I wonder if you can comment on whether or not you're seeing businesses react either positively or negatively as they face some of the uncertainty around timing and what the reforms may be? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. First of all, my comments on churn were about the low end that I spoke, I think we have room to go on the low end. I want to reduce churn across every customer that we have. And until we have the best customer experience, I still think that we have room to grow and room to improve. So we will continue to focus on providing the best customer experience. We'll continue to focus on looking at things like how do we renew better, when do we go and talk to customers about renewals, and how do we do a better job of satisfying an existing customer's needs for extended services. And so my comments were around the low end in particular. I won't quantify how much improvement we have. But I think we can do better. I seriously think we can do better. And that's a relatively small piece of our overall business. But I think we can do better across those customers and across all of our enterprise customers, so we'll continue to focus on that. I don't have a good sense of how much of that is on-net versus off-net. Sunit, I don't know if you do, but I don't have a good sense off the top of my head of on-net versus off-net. I tell you you're right in your assumption that I'd rather save an on-net customer than an off-net customer. But that also creates opportunities for us as we look at the CenturyLink transaction. There are customers today that are off-net to one of us that we can move to on-net, and that gives us an opportunity to capture network synergies, but it gives us an opportunity to provide a better experience to the customer. And so, that's part of the value of the combination. With respect to regulatory reform, I do think that there are a lot of people out there that are wondering what's going on. If you look at our healthcare customers, there's a lot of anxiety around what new rules and things are going to be. But I don't see that affecting their view of their bandwidth needs or their view of their networking challenges. And so we haven't seen anything in particular. It obviously comes up in a lot of conversations with customers, but we haven't seen the change in buying patterns. We haven't seen people saying no, I'm going to hold off, I'm waiting to hear what the administration does about this or about that. I think most people that we're dealing with, save the government customers, put them aside. Most of the people that we're dealing with are moving forward with the network plans and the IT expansions, and things that they've had going. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah, we don't see any change in that. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And then on your question, the tax side, look, it's still too early to know what is being contemplated and if it's going to pass, when. So really tough to comment on that at this stage. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. So that was the last question that we had in the queue, so I'd like to end the call with a few thoughts. First of all, profitable growth continues to be a driving force in how we operate our business, and we believe our ongoing focus here enables us to continue to grow free cash flow and free cash flow per share in 2017. We are laser focused on improving the experience for our customers across the interactions they have with Level 3. Providing a differentiated customer experience is a key driver of our success in growing revenue. I shared this many times before that our vision is to be the trusted connection to the networked world. We firmly believe that the CenturyLink transaction is the next step in the evolution of that vision and will enable us to deliver an even better experience to our customers, while providing value to our stockholders. As always, thank you for joining today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call. Operator Thank you, Jeff.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, May 3, 2017. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Valerie Finberg, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am. Valerie Finberg - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Pam. Good evening everyone and thank you for joining us for the Level 3 Communications' first quarter 2017 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sunit Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Prior-period results for the first quarter 2016 are presented on a pro forma basis, adjusted to reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2017, due to mergers between certain customers and other changes. Unless otherwise noted, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year and a constant currency basis. All of our earnings materials, including the presentation we will review on this call, can be found in the Investor Relations section of the Level 3 website at investors.level3.com. You can see our cautionary statements beginning on page 2 of the 1Q 2017 earnings presentation, which says that the presentation and remarks contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Results may vary significantly from those statements. Additional information is available in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The presentation also includes the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thanks, Valerie. Good evening, everyone and thank you for joining us. Level 3 delivered solid first quarter results with continued growth in CNS enterprise revenue. Although, we'd like to see better revenue performance and are investing to drive revenue, our focus on profitable growth is enabling Level 3 to continue to increase adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow this year and we reaffirmed our guidance for both metrics today. As we look at the pending transaction with CenturyLink, the regulatory process is moving forward as expected and we anticipate closing at the end of September. Our goal to build the world's premier global enterprise networking company, driven by profitable growth and increasing free cash flow per share, guides our approach to integration planning. We're designing an organization structure and an approach to the market that will position us well for the future, and we've made good progress in those planning efforts. However, until the close, the Level 3 team remains highly focused on delivering excellent value to our customers, implementing ongoing improvements to the customer experience, competing aggressively to gain market share and managing our business with financial discipline. Per our usual process, Sunit will provide an update on our detailed results. I'll then provide commentary on how Level 3 is addressing current market trends and a little more color on integration planning. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. Sunit? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Jeff and good evening everyone. Let's start with slide 5 and a few financial highlights from the first quarter. We reaffirmed our full-year 2017 financial outlook. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $725 million in the quarter. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.1 times, and our free cash flow was $173 million. In the quarter, we had higher capital expenditures and higher cash interest expense. Additionally, in the first quarter, we typically pay annual employee bonuses along with prepayments on software and maintenance contracts. Overall, we remain confident in our 2007 (sic) [2017] outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. Let's now turn to revenue results on slide 6. For the first quarter, total revenue declined 0.1%, CNS revenue grew 0.1% and enterprise CNS revenue excluding UK government grew 3.3%. Within CNS, revenue from our large multinational enterprise customers increased 7.4%. Although the growth from this customers was a little slower than we've seen in past quarters, we saw strong sequential sales. And as we've noted in the past, revenue performance can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 7.4%, primarily due to continued consolidation-driven disconnects from wireless and cable customers. Shifting to regional results, North America CNS revenue declined 0.4% for the first quarter, while enterprise CNS revenue grew 2.1%. Moving to EMEA, in the first quarter, EMEA CNS revenue decreased 1.0%, while enterprise CNS revenue excluding UK government increased 5.4%. On a year-over-year basis, the pound, sterling and the euro weakened against the dollar. Sequentially these currencies strengthened slightly. Compared to the first quarter 2016, the pound, sterling and the euro declined 3% and 14% respectively, negatively impacting reported revenue by approximately $13 million. In Latin America, we saw another strong quarter of performance with CNS revenue increasing 6.8% and enterprise CNS revenue growing 13%. On slide 7, we highlight the sequential performance of our North America enterprise customer groups. Overall results were mixed, and while we are clearly doing better at the bottom end, we're working to improve our performance across all these groups. Moving to slide 8, Wholesale Voice Services or WVS revenue was $102 million in the first quarter 2017 compared to $105 million from the year-ago quarter, representing 5% of total revenue. Turning to slide 9, from a product group perspective, IP & data services grew 0.7% and transport & fiber also grew 0.7%. Voice services declined 2.2%, and colocation and data center services revenue declined 1.2%. From an individual product perspective, we saw CDN growth of 15% and managed security growth of 9.1%. We also saw dark fiber growth of 5.3%. Turning to slide 10, network access margin expanded to 66.3% compared to 66.2% in the first quarter 2016. Turning to slide 11, excluding CenturyLink acquisition-related expenses, adjusted EBITDA was $725 million for the first quarter 2017 compared to $710 million in the first quarter 2016. CenturyLink acquisition-related expenses incurred in the first quarter 2017 totaled $20 million, of which $18 million were non-cash and $2 million were cash expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.4% in the first quarter of 2017, excluding acquisition-related expenses. This compares to 34.6% in the first quarter 2016. For the first quarter 2017, capital expenditures were $368 million, which were higher than average, due to capital spent on fiber builds along with success-based capital from customer orders. During the first quarter, Level 3 refinanced approximately $4.6 billion of senior secured term loans, lowering our spread over LIBOR by 64 basis points. As a result, the company recognized a loss before taxes of $44 million or $0.08 in basic earnings per share on the extinguishment and modification of debt after taxes. The company generated free cash flow $173 million in the first quarter, which excludes cash-related acquisition-related expenses of $2 million. This compares to $213 million from the year-ago quarter. If you look at our outlook for cash interest expense of $520 million for the full-year 2017, the expected average per quarter is about $130 million. This quarter, given the refinancing of our term loan and acceleration of interest payments in the quarter, our cash interest paid was $153 million. Similarly, our capital expenditures averaged $334 million per quarter in 2016, and as I mentioned earlier, were $368 million in the first quarter 2017. We continue to make progress in reducing our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, exiting the quarter at 3.1 times, which excludes acquisition-related expenses and compares to 3.7 times in the first quarter 2016. We're getting close to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4 times. In the first quarter of 2017, we generated net income of $95 million and basic earnings per share of $0.26. While the effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 43%, we expect our tax rate to be lower in subsequent quarters, and overall, we continue to expect our GAAP income tax rate to average about 38% for the full-year 2017. Turning to our business outlook for 2017 on slide 12, as mentioned in our earnings release and as I highlighted earlier, we are reaffirming our 2017 financial outlook for full-year adjusted EBITDA of $2.94 billion to $3 billion and free cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.16 billion. Notwithstanding the higher than normal CapEx in the quarter, our full-year outlook for capital expenditures remains unchanged at 16% of total revenue. In summary, we are off to a good start to the year and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our financial objectives for 2017. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Thank you, Sunit. As we look across our three regions, market demand remains healthy. Sales bookings started off a little slow at the beginning of the year, but strengthened throughout the quarter and we closed out the quarter with solid sales and a strong funnel. Level 3 continues to benefit from many of the trends our customers see within their businesses, the continuing demand for greater and greater bandwidth, the ongoing migration to the cloud, the need for hybrid networking solutions to maximize the benefit of that migration, the ability to defend their networking solutions against an ever more hostile threat environment and the digital initiatives that are transforming our customers' own business models. The strength of Level 3 is our broad and robust network, supporting a broad and robust portfolio of products. Network is not something our customers build between two cities. Network is something they do to drive their business forward. They want to network their data centers together. They want to network their remote employees with their corporate headquarters. They want to network with their customers, with their suppliers, with their equipment, and in the age of the Internet of Things, with virtually every device necessary to support their business. Network is now something they do to be successful. Each of these networking needs is best addressed by specific products. Tying together two data centers in the same city or across the country is often a dark fiber solution, while a relatively small market overall, we meet this need head on and have seen great success in selling dark fiber services in a very competitive market. When traffic is lower or the distance is longer, this is more likely best served by a wave transport solution and our family of wave products meet this need well, up to 100 gigabit per second products. For customers tying remote offices to a corporate headquarters, more and more of that calls for hybrid WAN solution, with VPNs for some locations and standard IT services for others. For content distribution, our CDN services utilize our core IT backbone to provide a differentiated customer experience. Our Level 3 Cloud Connect products allow customers a flexible, scalable mechanism to connect to today's great cloud providers. That maybe a long list of services, but the point is that networking requirements are as varied as the applications and the needs they're meant to support. There's the old adage, if all you've got is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. If all you've got is dark fiber, everything looks like a dark fiber solution. If all you've got is CDN, everything looks like a CDN. If all you've got is best efforts Internet, everything looks like an IT solution. The strength of Level 3 is our ability to seamlessly meet all of the customer's networking needs over one of the world's most sophisticated and highly-integrated networks. From conference calling to content distribution, from IT to dark fiber or from Voice Complete to Advanced Threat Intelligence, and protecting our customers' valuable digital assets, Level 3 works with our customers across all of their networking needs. With the CenturyLink combination, we'll be able to take these services and more to customers over a broader and even more robust network. This wider range of capabilities will create more value for our customers and make us more competitive in the market. From an integration planning perspective, the teams had made tremendous progress over the last several months and we're also well into defining our network strategy. As you recall, network expense savings are a key portion of the overall synergies and the network itself is the foundation for everything we do. The ability to serve more customers on net leads to better customer experience, shorter provisioning times and a better competitive result. It really just comes back to both the scale and the scope that are so critical in driving profitable growth and increasing free cash flow per share. We're very excited about what we can do together as a combined company. We'll now open it up for your questions. Operator, would you explain the process? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Absolutely. And our first question from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, guys, thanks. I guess the same question I think I asked last quarter, we used to talk about 2% quarter-to-quarter growth as your goal for enterprise. It's been a long time since we saw that. And I wonder if this is still what we should expect as an internal goal at least or has the environment changed the impact to that potential? And then if I can just a follow-up as well on the trends in that SMB business that we've been talking about for a while. What are you seeing in churn there? Thanks. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Well, I think, Phil, on the 2%, as we've said last quarter, we're not providing revenue guidance focused more on profitable growth, and I think that's the right emphasis. Having said that, I think that the investments we've made in improving our customer experience, I think, will continue to position us well to drive better revenue performance over time, which we said was our objective this year to try and drive a little better revenue performance this year. So, I think, that's where we are on that point. On the SMB side, I think the efforts that we made over the last several quarters are yielding benefit, and as we said last time, it's too early to declare victory on one data point or even two, but that continues to be an area of focus for us. And we're really excited about the upcoming combination with CenturyLink, because we are up against some fairly large competitors in that area, and then I think that hopefully we get together, we can continue to do a better job on that SMB space. Jeff, I don't know if you have... Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. No, I think that's right. I mean, we've done a lot of things to make sure that we're going to market correctly for the SMB customers, making sure we have the right product set for them and make sure we're talking to them and communicating with them about the value of the products going forwards. And so we're pleased with the progress. It's, as Sunit says, too early to declare victory, but we are pleased with the progress we're making. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks, guys. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Co. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Two questions if I may. When we look at both companies in terms of results this evening, it looks like you guys are executing perhaps better on your strategies and CenturyLink is right now in terms of execution just simply getting closer to achieving the guidance that you've set forth. What is it that you've learned between now, when the deal was announced, that you think you could apply to their strategy that could help potentially with their own results? And then secondly, net neutrality, it seems like that's going to be repealed. Any thought on how that might impact your business or the combined company's business, particularly their latest Tier 1 IP transit business? Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah, so. Thanks, Colby. With respect to the things that we've learned since we announced the transaction, all of those things are supportive of the transaction. We've learned that there's some products and capabilities that they have that would be great for our customers, and that we want to bring to our customers. I think that Glen mentioned on his call that he likes our GM model that we've followed in, and so how we go to market with for some of our enterprise customers, we'll try and make sure that we capitalize on that. So what we're really focused on in the integration planning is taking the best of both companies, putting them together in a way that really meets the needs of our enterprise customers and continues to grow that business for both of us. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And also one other thing I would add is just all of that through the lens of profitable growth and a clear focus on bottom line performance I think, especially given the synergies that we have to achieve, I think that has to – that's going to be an overall focus, I think, to the combined company. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. That's right. And then with respect to net neutrality, look, we -Level 3 has long believed in an open Internet. We believe that net neutrality is good for consumers. We think it's good for Level 3. But we've also approached this through commercial negotiations with people that we have to interface with. And so we'll continue to do that. We believe an open Internet is good, but at the same time, we've worked through all of the issues that we need with our customers and with other providers to make sure that we have the interconnection facilities in place and support our business model. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. Appreciate it. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks very much. Jeff, I think on the network strategy, you talked a little bit about the opportunity and the synergies there. And perhaps you did a very nice job with network synergies on Global Crossing and tw telecom. To what extent is this a similar type network integration or is the scale very different, giving you the visibility into those synergies? And then maybe for Sunit, the wholesale pressure, you talked about carrier churn. Is that something you see persisting for the rest of the year or is that more of a temporary phenomenon? Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. With respect to the scale, certainly the scale is different, because it's the combination of all those companies that make up Level 3, and now we're combining with CenturyLink, which is a very large company as well. So the scale is different, but it looks the same. And it has the same benefits to us. I mean, there are times that we go after synergies for the cost savings. But the majority of our network synergies are about providing a better product and service to our customers and a better experience to our customers, and the cost savings are the side benefits that we get from it. And we know that when we put customers on net, we are able to provide better experience, better service delivery, better service assurance. We're able to do a better job for that customer. When we do a better job for the customer, they buy more services from us, and they continue to maintain the ones that they have with us. And so we look at the network evolution as a continued evolution, not only in cost savings, but also in our customer experience and the product that we provide those customers. And so certainly, there is bigger scale associated with the CenturyLink/Level 3 than some of those others, but it's much the same problem, it's much the same challenge, and we have great experience in both companies of really delivering on that in a way that is supportive of our customers rather than harmful to our customers. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And on the wholesale question, we sustained a lot of the declines over the course of last year. I think it's stabilizing some. So I think at least going forward on a sequential basis, we'll see some of those pressures subside a little. The year-over-year comparisons won't look good for a while, but at least sequentially, I think even if you look at our fourth quarter wholesale results and first quarter wholesale results, you'll see that. So I think that we've gone through a tough patch with all the consolidation of wireless and cable business. And having said that, as I look forward over the next couple of years, there will still be some impact from consolidation activity. There's plenty being talked about certainly. And two, there will be offset by the beginnings of the investments in 5G infrastructure across the U.S. I think that in general will be beneficial for us. So that's how we see it. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch upon the demand environment in the enterprise market. You folks continue to see sequential growth in the CNS side. CenturyLink mentioned that they're seeing some traction from their perspective. Some of the larger folks are seeing some softness. So, wanted to just get your take on sort of the broader environment here and how you folks can capitalize on some of the opportunities that you're seeing as a combined entity? And then the second question is you've mentioned sort of mid-single digit growth I believe in dark fiber side. What's been driving sort of that? And how do you see that progression going forward? Thanks very much. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Thanks. With respect to the demand environment, we saw softness in the very end of last year, the beginning of the first quarter, but it grew through the first quarter. And so by the end of the first quarter, we feel pretty good about our sales bookings. We feel pretty good about our funnel looking forward. And so the demand environment is healthy. It's never linear. There are things that come into play each and every quarter, but the demand environment is pretty healthy. Now what's up to us is making sure we capture on that demand environment. And it's a very competitive market out there. But we think we have great products and services. We have an excellent sales team that remains focused on driving Level 3's performance and driving outperformance all the way till the closing of the CenturyLink deal. And we're pretty pleased with where we are from a demand side perspective. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. And I would add, we're still at the stages where you look at the growth of some of the big cloud services players, whether it's AWS, Microsoft Azure and others in the data center field, I think all of that will continue to drive more business on our side as all of this data has to move around, be replicated, diversely routed. So I think that's all a good indicator for the demand environment over the next few years as enterprises make this move towards a hybrid world, which will continue for quite some time. On your other question, I think essentially as we look at – sorry about that. On the other question, I guess, the main point is, we see demand for dark fiber. I mean, we've been consistent in the growth rate we've reported now for several quarters. So it's been a steady growth. I don't think it's gone up or gone down. We've been at that level. We see demand coming from some of the big west coast companies, we see demand coming from cable companies, we see demand coming from some of the finance verticals. So those are the areas where we are seeing strength. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And dark fiber is a very competitive business out there. And we win when we do a better job than our competitors. And that's what we are focused on is working with customers to make sure we understand what applications are appropriate for dark fiber and which ones aren't. And we work with them to understand their overall networking needs. We don't want to just go in with every solution as dark fiber. Sometimes that's the right solution, sometimes it's a wave solution, sometimes it's IP VPN. So we work really closely with our customers to understand their overall needs and then we come up with solutions that meet those needs, tying their data centers together with dark fiber, they're tying their branch offices to their headquarters with the hybrid WAN solution. And we'll continue to work with customers to try and meet their kind of overall needs in the networking space. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And also we see demand not just in North America, but we were seeing good demand for dark fiber, similar type of this in Latin America and in Europe also. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Operator Our next question from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please proceed. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Thanks. And good afternoon. I guess one follow-up question on churn. I noted that CNS churn did tick up a little bit, obviously, not outside of historical ranges, so I don't think there is anything – too much to read into that. But just wondering it looks like the low-end is performing better over the last couple of quarters. Wondering if maybe you could just give a little bit more detail on where you are seeing some of that churn that may have driven that tick-up this quarter? And then secondly, bigger picture industry, obviously, a lot more talk these days around 5G. Obviously, we can debate whether that's real in the near-term or not. But Level 3 hadn't typically gone after the fiber-to-the-tower business, but I think 5G obviously brings a very different architecture than what we've seen historically in the wireless world. So, wondering if you guys could just frame what the opportunity might look like if anything for Level 3 and how that view may differ when you include CenturyLink in the mix as well. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Okay. On the churn question, typically first quarter we do see a little higher churn, a lot of it mostly from the wholesale sector. People are done with their budgets for December, new budget season comes in in January. So that's typically, it's up a little, it's more in the wholesale side than anywhere else. So – and like you said, it's slight, so we're not too concerned about that. On the 5G side, I'll give you some thoughts, Jeff might have some, but I think in general your point is right. The need for 5G fiber infrastructure is a lot more distributed than just connecting to towers. There are lot more places to connect to. It's clearly a bigger benefit for like a local phone company or cable company is more capitalized, so I think CenturyLink would be a beneficiary. The areas that we have – like Level 3 has metro networks in highly densely populated urban areas, where it could be useful for us. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I just agree with Sunit's answer on that, Scott, and your comment of let's wait first and see if it's real and how real it is and what environment it's real for. And if you look at the Level 3 network, it's really been hard for us to look at going into a market and building everything in the market, because maybe there are few sites that make sense, but overall the investment doesn't make sense. When you start combining with CenturyLink, and you have more local capillarity and more density of the network, then it probably makes more sense for the combined company than it might for Level 3 alone. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, the last several quarters, you've had higher CapEx in part to support dark fiber and wavelength's growth. When do we start to see the revenue benefit from that spending closer to P&L? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. So we're already seeing the revenue benefit as measured by cash coming in through the door. For dark fiber revenues, typically, and if you have 20 year higher use, the gap benefit stretches out for 20 years, but in addition we get space and power revenues which are monthly recurring in nature, and annual maintenance fees which are recurring in nature. So I think that we will continue to see the benefit of that coming through over the next years, because the business, as we pointed out, has been pretty – demand has been very, very healthy. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. And maybe one more, you've been taking steps to bolster results in EMEA for a couple of years now. Can you step back and maybe talk about what investments and efforts you think have worked and maybe what has lived up to expectations and maybe needs more work? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. We've invested in a number of different things, mostly about focus. Investing in our sales team, investing in the organization that we have, to focus on the major markets in EMEA, so the UK, France, Germany, Benelux rather than distributing all of our focus across all other different markets, really, really intensifying in those individual markets, where the majority of the demand is. And so I think that that's working for us. We've increased our focus on enterprise customers and a little less dependence on wholesale customers and continue to drive the capabilities that enterprise customers want. And we've been very successful in North America. We've leveraged that success with financial institutions and other types of enterprise customers to drive growth in EMEA. There are obviously things that we've done that could have worked out better. I don't have a long list of those things that I want to go through. But we're very critical of our own performance and we shine a bright light on our successes, but also on our mistakes and our failures. So, we look at the things that we've done, shine a very bright light on it, analyze it, look at it, ask ourselves questions, and then adjust our approach based on that. But we're also not afraid to take risks. And that's what we have to continue to do, is to really focus on the capabilities that those customers want, that those customers need and then making sure that we're delivering those capabilities over the infrastructure that we have. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And the other point I would say, when we look at it from a profitability perspective, the business since we bought Global Crossing six plus years ago, revenues have shrunk 25% mostly due to the UK government contract and some wholesale revenues, but EBITDA margins in spite of that have gone from 10% to 15% to the high-20%. So, we have made a lot of investments in capital and also in optimizing the cost base to make it a very profitable business. And to do that, so, we in every year, in the last year is we spent more as a percent percentage of revenue on CapEx in EMEA than we have in the U.S. to continue to expand our presence and network base and keeping a sharp eye on profitable growth. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. That's great. Thanks, guys. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. And two questions if you don't mind. You were talking earlier about how the cost synergies are reasonably easy to identify and achieve in this transaction and that it's all about more how you go to market, that you'd noted how much incremental scale in the enterprise market you're going to achieve by combining with CenturyLink. Maybe just anecdotally, if possible, talk to us about where you think you've been missing chances to win business in the past, because you just didn't have the scale. And what kind of doors do you think are going to be open to the company now that you can pursue? And then just as an extension of this question on the deal, CenturyLink announced sort of what the management team is going to look like when this transaction closes. I'm curious what are you doing on your side to prepare for the integration, particularly around things like head count retention? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. With respect to what deals do we lose and that will get benefit from the CenturyLink transaction, there's the capillarity of the network. And I apologize that we've used that phrase for eight or 10 years now, but it's important. The value of a network is based on its connectivity. In CenturyLink areas, they have great connectivity. They have great SD-WAN products and Ethernet products that we're going to be able to leverage to deliver for all of our customers across that infrastructure. And so, they bring quite a bit to Level 3 and to Level 3 customers. Now I hope that Level 3 brings just as much to the CenturyLink customers and to the CenturyLink business. But there really are opportunities for us to go out and win corporate networks where they have a bunch of remote locations and maybe we weren't competitive from a pricing and ability to deliver when we're having to buy all of that off net. This will make us more competitive in the market, more able to compete with the AT&T and Verizons and Deutsche Telecom and British Telecom and all of those different companies while we're operating in the U.S. With respect to the management and what are we doing to keep management, we're doing everything that we can. We think we have an incredibly talented team of executives and managers all the way down to the GMs and the sales directors and throughout our company in service delivery, service assurance. We think we have the most talented team in the industry. And as a result of that, other people think we have the most talented team in the industry as well. And so we do get targeted. But we get targeted by a bunch of different companies and you can't go to any of the large networking companies and large content companies and look in their network department and find anything but Level 3 people running around. And so we're actually used to this environment where people come and try and lure our team away from us. So we do a lot of things that are inherent in the way that we operate, give people opportunities to expand, challenge people with rewarding jobs, push authority down into the organization, so that people are challenged to satisfy our customers and that they have the authority and the ability to do that. That's a rewarding job. We try and create those for our employees across the board. We also have put in retention programs in place to make sure that we do what we can from a financial perceptive to retain the key employees. We also spend a lot of time talking to employees and talking about the value that they create. I'm going to have a call on Friday with our sales organization and my message is to them, if you're performing and you're in sales, we want you in the combined company. We want every sales person, every good sales manager, every good sales director to help us drive the growth of the combined business. And so we do a lot of things to make sure that we are focused on retaining the key talent. Now, having said that, we will lose people, and we're used to that. We're accustomed to it, and our funnel of building people and bringing them up is one of the strengths that we have in our organization. And so the churn of people is inevitable, but it's also good for us, because it gives opportunities for people to step up and do different roles. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking the questions. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you. Could you comment on your customer base? Have you had any conversation with customers about what their possible reaction might be to tax reform or repatriation and their propensity to invest and grow? Do you think that would be a positive for your base business? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I mean, we haven't specifically talked about tax reform, but I think clearly the two key tenets, one is repatriation of cash and lowering of income taxes for corporations are both very positive things for companies and won't surprise me if that drove to more investment obviously. And till it actually is tangible and gets through, nobody is really going to change their spending plans per se, but there is certainly excitement and buzz around it. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Frank, I'm going to twist your question just a little bit of tax reform and tell you what our customers are saying to us, because Sunit and I both spend a lot of time on the road talking to customers, talking about our business, talking about the CenturyLink transaction and talking about what they need. And what they need is a high-performing, very capable network with a robust set of products and a robust set of infrastructure so that we can meet their needs. And from all of the customers that I've talked to after the conversations, maybe they have initial questions about how CenturyLink and Level 3 are going to work together. But after the conversations, every customer I've talked to has been very positive about it. They see this as a strength, to give a scale, scope and ability to deliver for them. They see it as a strength in combining two strong, rich, fiber-based networks together and meeting their needs. And so, the customers have been pretty positive. And they haven't told me about how they're going to repatriate the money, or if they're going to spend more directly as a result. But I'm hopeful that that's going to happen anyway, so. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. And all those comments has been very positive. Same experience, yeah. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. All right. Just a... Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. I'd say as a follow-up I was going to say if you had any – what's the conversation you had in Washington about infrastructure spending, and to the extent that it sounds like what's being discussed is something that you'll be able to participate in? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. We spend a lot of time working with the federal customers and I won't get into specifics, and I'm not going to project what the government will spend on infrastructure that applies to us. But I'll tell you that, that we're very good at meeting those customers' needs as well. If you look at our federal business over the past few years, we've done a really good job of growing it. We've got an excellent team in Washington. We don't approach the federal government just as another customer. We approach them as a different way of doing business with them, a way of supporting them, a way of helping them, meet the needs and the challenges that are unique to the federal government. And we've been very successful at it. And so I expect that to the extent there are opportunities for our products and services, we'll continue to win in the market competing for them directly. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I believe that's our last question. So I'd like to close the call with a few thoughts. The team at Level 3 remains focused on executing in the market. We are focused on driving profitable growth and delivering for our customers. We are continually enhancing our performance and our customer experience and recognize that, that is a key differentiator in the market. We're excited about the company we'll create with CenturyLink transaction and our opportunity to become the premier global provider of enterprise networking services. Additionally, as we look at the financial benefits of the transaction, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to grow free cash flow per share, which we believe is a key component of increasing stockholder value. Thank you for joining today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call. Operator Thank you, Jeff. We would like to thank everyone for your participation and for using the Level 3 conferencing service today. This does conclude the conference call, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

And our first question from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey, guys, thanks. I guess the same question I think I asked last quarter, we used to talk about 2% quarter-to-quarter growth as your goal for enterprise. It's been a long time since we saw that. And I wonder if this is still what we should expect as an internal goal at least or has the environment changed the impact to that potential? And then if I can just a follow-up as well on the trends in that SMB business that we've been talking about for a while. What are you seeing in churn there? Thanks. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Well, I think, Phil, on the 2%, as we've said last quarter, we're not providing revenue guidance focused more on profitable growth, and I think that's the right emphasis. Having said that, I think that the investments we've made in improving our customer experience, I think, will continue to position us well to drive better revenue performance over time, which we said was our objective this year to try and drive a little better revenue performance this year. So, I think, that's where we are on that point. On the SMB side, I think the efforts that we made over the last several quarters are yielding benefit, and as we said last time, it's too early to declare victory on one data point or even two, but that continues to be an area of focus for us. And we're really excited about the upcoming combination with CenturyLink, because we are up against some fairly large competitors in that area, and then I think that hopefully we get together, we can continue to do a better job on that SMB space. Jeff, I don't know if you have... Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. No, I think that's right. I mean, we've done a lot of things to make sure that we're going to market correctly for the SMB customers, making sure we have the right product set for them and make sure we're talking to them and communicating with them about the value of the products going forwards. And so we're pleased with the progress. It's, as Sunit says, too early to declare victory, but we are pleased with the progress we're making. Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks, guys. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Colby Synesael from Cowen and Co. Please go ahead. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Great. Two questions if I may. When we look at both companies in terms of results this evening, it looks like you guys are executing perhaps better on your strategies and CenturyLink is right now in terms of execution just simply getting closer to achieving the guidance that you've set forth. What is it that you've learned between now, when the deal was announced, that you think you could apply to their strategy that could help potentially with their own results? And then secondly, net neutrality, it seems like that's going to be repealed. Any thought on how that might impact your business or the combined company's business, particularly their latest Tier 1 IP transit business? Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah, so. Thanks, Colby. With respect to the things that we've learned since we announced the transaction, all of those things are supportive of the transaction. We've learned that there's some products and capabilities that they have that would be great for our customers, and that we want to bring to our customers. I think that Glen mentioned on his call that he likes our GM model that we've followed in, and so how we go to market with for some of our enterprise customers, we'll try and make sure that we capitalize on that. So what we're really focused on in the integration planning is taking the best of both companies, putting them together in a way that really meets the needs of our enterprise customers and continues to grow that business for both of us. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And also one other thing I would add is just all of that through the lens of profitable growth and a clear focus on bottom line performance I think, especially given the synergies that we have to achieve, I think that has to – that's going to be an overall focus, I think, to the combined company. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. That's right. And then with respect to net neutrality, look, we -Level 3 has long believed in an open Internet. We believe that net neutrality is good for consumers. We think it's good for Level 3. But we've also approached this through commercial negotiations with people that we have to interface with. And so we'll continue to do that. We believe an open Internet is good, but at the same time, we've worked through all of the issues that we need with our customers and with other providers to make sure that we have the interconnection facilities in place and support our business model. Colby Synesael - Cowen & Co. LLC Thank you. Appreciate it. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks very much. Jeff, I think on the network strategy, you talked a little bit about the opportunity and the synergies there. And perhaps you did a very nice job with network synergies on Global Crossing and tw telecom. To what extent is this a similar type network integration or is the scale very different, giving you the visibility into those synergies? And then maybe for Sunit, the wholesale pressure, you talked about carrier churn. Is that something you see persisting for the rest of the year or is that more of a temporary phenomenon? Thanks. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. With respect to the scale, certainly the scale is different, because it's the combination of all those companies that make up Level 3, and now we're combining with CenturyLink, which is a very large company as well. So the scale is different, but it looks the same. And it has the same benefits to us. I mean, there are times that we go after synergies for the cost savings. But the majority of our network synergies are about providing a better product and service to our customers and a better experience to our customers, and the cost savings are the side benefits that we get from it. And we know that when we put customers on net, we are able to provide better experience, better service delivery, better service assurance. We're able to do a better job for that customer. When we do a better job for the customer, they buy more services from us, and they continue to maintain the ones that they have with us. And so we look at the network evolution as a continued evolution, not only in cost savings, but also in our customer experience and the product that we provide those customers. And so certainly, there is bigger scale associated with the CenturyLink/Level 3 than some of those others, but it's much the same problem, it's much the same challenge, and we have great experience in both companies of really delivering on that in a way that is supportive of our customers rather than harmful to our customers. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And on the wholesale question, we sustained a lot of the declines over the course of last year. I think it's stabilizing some. So I think at least going forward on a sequential basis, we'll see some of those pressures subside a little. The year-over-year comparisons won't look good for a while, but at least sequentially, I think even if you look at our fourth quarter wholesale results and first quarter wholesale results, you'll see that. So I think that we've gone through a tough patch with all the consolidation of wireless and cable business. And having said that, as I look forward over the next couple of years, there will still be some impact from consolidation activity. There's plenty being talked about certainly. And two, there will be offset by the beginnings of the investments in 5G infrastructure across the U.S. I think that in general will be beneficial for us. So that's how we see it. Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead. Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc. Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch upon the demand environment in the enterprise market. You folks continue to see sequential growth in the CNS side. CenturyLink mentioned that they're seeing some traction from their perspective. Some of the larger folks are seeing some softness. So, wanted to just get your take on sort of the broader environment here and how you folks can capitalize on some of the opportunities that you're seeing as a combined entity? And then the second question is you've mentioned sort of mid-single digit growth I believe in dark fiber side. What's been driving sort of that? And how do you see that progression going forward? Thanks very much. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Thanks. With respect to the demand environment, we saw softness in the very end of last year, the beginning of the first quarter, but it grew through the first quarter. And so by the end of the first quarter, we feel pretty good about our sales bookings. We feel pretty good about our funnel looking forward. And so the demand environment is healthy. It's never linear. There are things that come into play each and every quarter, but the demand environment is pretty healthy. Now what's up to us is making sure we capture on that demand environment. And it's a very competitive market out there. But we think we have great products and services. We have an excellent sales team that remains focused on driving Level 3's performance and driving outperformance all the way till the closing of the CenturyLink deal. And we're pretty pleased with where we are from a demand side perspective. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. And I would add, we're still at the stages where you look at the growth of some of the big cloud services players, whether it's AWS, Microsoft Azure and others in the data center field, I think all of that will continue to drive more business on our side as all of this data has to move around, be replicated, diversely routed. So I think that's all a good indicator for the demand environment over the next few years as enterprises make this move towards a hybrid world, which will continue for quite some time. On your other question, I think essentially as we look at – sorry about that. On the other question, I guess, the main point is, we see demand for dark fiber. I mean, we've been consistent in the growth rate we've reported now for several quarters. So it's been a steady growth. I don't think it's gone up or gone down. We've been at that level. We see demand coming from some of the big west coast companies, we see demand coming from cable companies, we see demand coming from some of the finance verticals. So those are the areas where we are seeing strength. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And dark fiber is a very competitive business out there. And we win when we do a better job than our competitors. And that's what we are focused on is working with customers to make sure we understand what applications are appropriate for dark fiber and which ones aren't. And we work with them to understand their overall networking needs. We don't want to just go in with every solution as dark fiber. Sometimes that's the right solution, sometimes it's a wave solution, sometimes it's IP VPN. So we work really closely with our customers to understand their overall needs and then we come up with solutions that meet those needs, tying their data centers together with dark fiber, they're tying their branch offices to their headquarters with the hybrid WAN solution. And we'll continue to work with customers to try and meet their kind of overall needs in the networking space. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And also we see demand not just in North America, but we were seeing good demand for dark fiber, similar type of this in Latin America and in Europe also. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Operator Our next question from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please proceed. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Thanks. And good afternoon. I guess one follow-up question on churn. I noted that CNS churn did tick up a little bit, obviously, not outside of historical ranges, so I don't think there is anything – too much to read into that. But just wondering it looks like the low-end is performing better over the last couple of quarters. Wondering if maybe you could just give a little bit more detail on where you are seeing some of that churn that may have driven that tick-up this quarter? And then secondly, bigger picture industry, obviously, a lot more talk these days around 5G. Obviously, we can debate whether that's real in the near-term or not. But Level 3 hadn't typically gone after the fiber-to-the-tower business, but I think 5G obviously brings a very different architecture than what we've seen historically in the wireless world. So, wondering if you guys could just frame what the opportunity might look like if anything for Level 3 and how that view may differ when you include CenturyLink in the mix as well. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Okay. On the churn question, typically first quarter we do see a little higher churn, a lot of it mostly from the wholesale sector. People are done with their budgets for December, new budget season comes in in January. So that's typically, it's up a little, it's more in the wholesale side than anywhere else. So – and like you said, it's slight, so we're not too concerned about that. On the 5G side, I'll give you some thoughts, Jeff might have some, but I think in general your point is right. The need for 5G fiber infrastructure is a lot more distributed than just connecting to towers. There are lot more places to connect to. It's clearly a bigger benefit for like a local phone company or cable company is more capitalized, so I think CenturyLink would be a beneficiary. The areas that we have – like Level 3 has metro networks in highly densely populated urban areas, where it could be useful for us. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I just agree with Sunit's answer on that, Scott, and your comment of let's wait first and see if it's real and how real it is and what environment it's real for. And if you look at the Level 3 network, it's really been hard for us to look at going into a market and building everything in the market, because maybe there are few sites that make sense, but overall the investment doesn't make sense. When you start combining with CenturyLink, and you have more local capillarity and more density of the network, then it probably makes more sense for the combined company than it might for Level 3 alone. Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, the last several quarters, you've had higher CapEx in part to support dark fiber and wavelength's growth. When do we start to see the revenue benefit from that spending closer to P&L? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. So we're already seeing the revenue benefit as measured by cash coming in through the door. For dark fiber revenues, typically, and if you have 20 year higher use, the gap benefit stretches out for 20 years, but in addition we get space and power revenues which are monthly recurring in nature, and annual maintenance fees which are recurring in nature. So I think that we will continue to see the benefit of that coming through over the next years, because the business, as we pointed out, has been pretty – demand has been very, very healthy. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. And maybe one more, you've been taking steps to bolster results in EMEA for a couple of years now. Can you step back and maybe talk about what investments and efforts you think have worked and maybe what has lived up to expectations and maybe needs more work? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. We've invested in a number of different things, mostly about focus. Investing in our sales team, investing in the organization that we have, to focus on the major markets in EMEA, so the UK, France, Germany, Benelux rather than distributing all of our focus across all other different markets, really, really intensifying in those individual markets, where the majority of the demand is. And so I think that that's working for us. We've increased our focus on enterprise customers and a little less dependence on wholesale customers and continue to drive the capabilities that enterprise customers want. And we've been very successful in North America. We've leveraged that success with financial institutions and other types of enterprise customers to drive growth in EMEA. There are obviously things that we've done that could have worked out better. I don't have a long list of those things that I want to go through. But we're very critical of our own performance and we shine a bright light on our successes, but also on our mistakes and our failures. So, we look at the things that we've done, shine a very bright light on it, analyze it, look at it, ask ourselves questions, and then adjust our approach based on that. But we're also not afraid to take risks. And that's what we have to continue to do, is to really focus on the capabilities that those customers want, that those customers need and then making sure that we're delivering those capabilities over the infrastructure that we have. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. And the other point I would say, when we look at it from a profitability perspective, the business since we bought Global Crossing six plus years ago, revenues have shrunk 25% mostly due to the UK government contract and some wholesale revenues, but EBITDA margins in spite of that have gone from 10% to 15% to the high-20%. So, we have made a lot of investments in capital and also in optimizing the cost base to make it a very profitable business. And to do that, so, we in every year, in the last year is we spent more as a percent percentage of revenue on CapEx in EMEA than we have in the U.S. to continue to expand our presence and network base and keeping a sharp eye on profitable growth. Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC Okay. That's great. Thanks, guys. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks. And two questions if you don't mind. You were talking earlier about how the cost synergies are reasonably easy to identify and achieve in this transaction and that it's all about more how you go to market, that you'd noted how much incremental scale in the enterprise market you're going to achieve by combining with CenturyLink. Maybe just anecdotally, if possible, talk to us about where you think you've been missing chances to win business in the past, because you just didn't have the scale. And what kind of doors do you think are going to be open to the company now that you can pursue? And then just as an extension of this question on the deal, CenturyLink announced sort of what the management team is going to look like when this transaction closes. I'm curious what are you doing on your side to prepare for the integration, particularly around things like head count retention? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. With respect to what deals do we lose and that will get benefit from the CenturyLink transaction, there's the capillarity of the network. And I apologize that we've used that phrase for eight or 10 years now, but it's important. The value of a network is based on its connectivity. In CenturyLink areas, they have great connectivity. They have great SD-WAN products and Ethernet products that we're going to be able to leverage to deliver for all of our customers across that infrastructure. And so, they bring quite a bit to Level 3 and to Level 3 customers. Now I hope that Level 3 brings just as much to the CenturyLink customers and to the CenturyLink business. But there really are opportunities for us to go out and win corporate networks where they have a bunch of remote locations and maybe we weren't competitive from a pricing and ability to deliver when we're having to buy all of that off net. This will make us more competitive in the market, more able to compete with the AT&T and Verizons and Deutsche Telecom and British Telecom and all of those different companies while we're operating in the U.S. With respect to the management and what are we doing to keep management, we're doing everything that we can. We think we have an incredibly talented team of executives and managers all the way down to the GMs and the sales directors and throughout our company in service delivery, service assurance. We think we have the most talented team in the industry. And as a result of that, other people think we have the most talented team in the industry as well. And so we do get targeted. But we get targeted by a bunch of different companies and you can't go to any of the large networking companies and large content companies and look in their network department and find anything but Level 3 people running around. And so we're actually used to this environment where people come and try and lure our team away from us. So we do a lot of things that are inherent in the way that we operate, give people opportunities to expand, challenge people with rewarding jobs, push authority down into the organization, so that people are challenged to satisfy our customers and that they have the authority and the ability to do that. That's a rewarding job. We try and create those for our employees across the board. We also have put in retention programs in place to make sure that we do what we can from a financial perceptive to retain the key employees. We also spend a lot of time talking to employees and talking about the value that they create. I'm going to have a call on Friday with our sales organization and my message is to them, if you're performing and you're in sales, we want you in the combined company. We want every sales person, every good sales manager, every good sales director to help us drive the growth of the combined business. And so we do a lot of things to make sure that we are focused on retaining the key talent. Now, having said that, we will lose people, and we're used to that. We're accustomed to it, and our funnel of building people and bringing them up is one of the strengths that we have in our organization. And so the churn of people is inevitable, but it's also good for us, because it gives opportunities for people to step up and do different roles. Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks for taking the questions. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Sure. Operator Our next question from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Great. Thank you. Could you comment on your customer base? Have you had any conversation with customers about what their possible reaction might be to tax reform or repatriation and their propensity to invest and grow? Do you think that would be a positive for your base business? Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I mean, we haven't specifically talked about tax reform, but I think clearly the two key tenets, one is repatriation of cash and lowering of income taxes for corporations are both very positive things for companies and won't surprise me if that drove to more investment obviously. And till it actually is tangible and gets through, nobody is really going to change their spending plans per se, but there is certainly excitement and buzz around it. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. Frank, I'm going to twist your question just a little bit of tax reform and tell you what our customers are saying to us, because Sunit and I both spend a lot of time on the road talking to customers, talking about our business, talking about the CenturyLink transaction and talking about what they need. And what they need is a high-performing, very capable network with a robust set of products and a robust set of infrastructure so that we can meet their needs. And from all of the customers that I've talked to after the conversations, maybe they have initial questions about how CenturyLink and Level 3 are going to work together. But after the conversations, every customer I've talked to has been very positive about it. They see this as a strength, to give a scale, scope and ability to deliver for them. They see it as a strength in combining two strong, rich, fiber-based networks together and meeting their needs. And so, the customers have been pretty positive. And they haven't told me about how they're going to repatriate the money, or if they're going to spend more directly as a result. But I'm hopeful that that's going to happen anyway, so. Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Yeah. And all those comments has been very positive. Same experience, yeah. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. All right. Just a... Sunit S. Patel - Level 3 Communications, Inc. Go ahead. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. I'd say as a follow-up I was going to say if you had any – what's the conversation you had in Washington about infrastructure spending, and to the extent that it sounds like what's being discussed is something that you'll be able to participate in? Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. We spend a lot of time working with the federal customers and I won't get into specifics, and I'm not going to project what the government will spend on infrastructure that applies to us. But I'll tell you that, that we're very good at meeting those customers' needs as well. If you look at our federal business over the past few years, we've done a really good job of growing it. We've got an excellent team in Washington. We don't approach the federal government just as another customer. We approach them as a different way of doing business with them, a way of supporting them, a way of helping them, meet the needs and the challenges that are unique to the federal government. And we've been very successful at it. And so I expect that to the extent there are opportunities for our products and services, we'll continue to win in the market competing for them directly. Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay, great. Thank you. Jeffrey K. Storey - Level 3 Communications, Inc. I believe that's our last question. So I'd like to close the call with a few thoughts. The team at Level 3 remains focused on executing in the market. We are focused on driving profitable growth and delivering for our customers. We are continually enhancing our performance and our customer experience and recognize that, that is a key differentiator in the market. We're excited about the company we'll create with CenturyLink transaction and our opportunity to become the premier global provider of enterprise networking services. Additionally, as we look at the financial benefits of the transaction, we believe the combined company will be well-positioned to grow free cash flow per share, which we believe is a key component of increasing stockholder value. Thank you for joining today's call and for your support of Level 3. Operator, that concludes the call. Operator Thank you, Jeff. We would like to thank everyone for your participation and for using the Level 3 conferencing service today. This does conclude the conference call, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines.

Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you, Amrita, and thank you all for joining us today. Our performance in 2016 further strengthened our position as the world's leading stand-alone interactive entertainment company. We achieved record results in 2016, delivering all-time high revenues of $6.6 billion, and record non-GAAP EPS of $2.18, up 42% and 68% respectively over last year. We also delivered record non-GAAP operating margins of 35%. We over-performed our plan for the quarter delivering record revenues of $2 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.65, up 49%, and 160% respectively over last year. We also delivered our strongest annual operating cash flow in history at $2.2 billion, up 71% over last year. Our success continues to be driven by our two greatest assets: our incredibly talented people, and the devoted community of gamers we serve. We have roughly 450 million players in 196 countries, and they spent over 40 billion hours playing our games in 2016, and they watched a record 3 billion hours as spectators of our games. We continued to see opportunities to expand audiences, deepen engagement and increased player investment. In fact, prioritization of opportunity remains our greatest challenge. But we remain vigilant in ensuring that the right resources are connected with the right priorities. We had number of important successes in 2016 that we'd like to acknowledge. Blizzard's new franchise, Overwatch, has captured the imaginations of players all over the world, and we've only scratched the surface. The truly extraordinary Overwatch team launched the most successful new intellectual property in our company's history. We now have over 25 million registered players and engagement has continued to grow. The King team was very focused on continuously releasing fresh content with new levels and features as well as increasing live operations efforts with events and competitions. As a result, mobile bookings for the Candy Crush franchise grew in 2016. King also made meaningful progress with its advertising initiatives. Last year's advertising tests had two primary goals: to design and build an outstanding ad platform that would actually enhance our users' in-game experience, and to deliver significant value to advertisers. We're encouraged with the early results. In most tests, our users play more game rounds, spend more time in the game, and have a self reported better game experience with advertising. Additionally, our platform delivers meaningful value to advertisers. We've partnered with some of the world's top advertisers, including Nestle, Fox Entertainment and Visa, and our viewability, verifiability and completion metrics are all encouraging. Ads are perceived as more unique and interesting when shown on King inventory, and viewers are more likely to take action after seeing an ad in King games. The King team will continue to build on their efforts this year, and we believe advertising has the potential to be a growth driver in the years to come. We also nurtured emerging growth opportunities outside of our games, including e-sports, television and film, and consumer products, and we enhanced the organizations that will support these initiatives. These new opportunities are consistent with and organic to our company's missions, and they have the potential to become important standalone businesses in pursuit of our goal to become the leading 21st century entertainment company. We accelerated our e-sports efforts with the integration of Major League Gaming, the formation of the Call of Duty World League, and the announcement of the Overwatch League. Our ambition is to create nothing less than the e-sports equivalent of the world's established major professional leagues. To this end, in 2017, we plan to start the process of selling teams and commercializing media rights for the Overwatch League. We look forward to welcoming team owners with the expertise, skills and investment required to build the professional league together. We plan to invest in these long-term growth pillars further in 2017 and expect them to have even greater impact in 2018 and beyond. I couldn't be more excited about our prospects for the future, and our team's dedication and enthusiasm reinforces my confidence that we will continue to achieve our ambitious plans. Thomas and Dennis will now share with you the results of our record quarter and our record year. Thomas Tippl - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you, Bobby. Due to our portfolio strength and digital momentum, we far exceeded our plans in 2016. We surpassed our initial revenue guidance by $0.5 billion and our initial non-GAAP EPS guidance by more than $0.40. And we also outperformed expectations for the holiday quarter. In driving our record-setting year, and as we look ahead, we remain focused on our three strategic pillars: first, expanding our audiences; second, deepening engagement; and third, providing opportunities for more player investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was 447 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had record Q4 MAUs of 41 million. And for the year, Blizzard had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 37% from 2015, and up 87% since 2014. This is a remarkable achievement, demonstrating the strength of the Blizzard portfolio and capabilities. Overwatch, released in May, set the record for the strongest launch year financial performance of any game in Blizzard's 26-year history. The game is critically acclaimed, receiving 55 game of the year awards and reached 25 million registered players faster than any franchise in Blizzard history, beating Diablo III's launch year unit sales record set in 2012, which for a new IP is an extraordinary accomplishment. In Q4, MAUs rose to a new franchise high, as existing players stayed engaged and new players joined the fun. Showcasing its continued global appeal, Overwatch has players all over the world, including great success in Korea and China. It's always difficult for Western companies to succeed there, and Overwatch's popularity is testament to Blizzard's unique ability to create globally appealing games. World of Warcraft's Legion expansion, which launched in late August, continues to reenergize the community. For the year, MAUs were up 10%, and for the quarter, MAUs were up over 20% versus year ago. Hearthstone players enjoyed a tremendous amount of new content in 2016, with one adventure and two expansions including Mean Streets of Gadgetzan in the fourth quarter. For the year, Hearthstone had record MAUs, up over 20% year-over-year, and for the quarter, MAUs were also up versus year ago. Activision had Q4 MAUs of 51 million. On a full-year basis, Activision had its highest annual MAUs ever, up 3% from 2015, and up 23% since 2014. Black Ops III's digital season led to record MAUs for Call of Duty in the year, and Destiny showed steady engagement in its third year. Call of Duty was the number one franchise in North America for the eighth year in a row, and the number one console franchise globally, a mantle we've held for seven of the last eight years. Activision's November release, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a high quality, innovative game that paired with Modern Warfare Remastered offers a tremendous amount of value and gameplay variety. However, sales underperformed our expectations, and it's clear that for a portion of our audience, the space setting just didn't resonate. We had a passionate experienced studio deeply committed to this direction, and despite the risks we saw, we believe it is important to consider the passions of our game teams in deciding what content to create. While it wasn't the success we planned, it allows us to protect a core tenets of our culture that Bobby discussed, empowering our talented teams to have the chance to pursue opportunities that they are passionate about. Providing an environment that recognizes passion is a critical component of our success, and the process to learn from our mistakes is what makes our company special, and it's why the most talented people in our industry are attracted to our company. In 2017, Activision will take Call of Duty back to its roots, and traditional combat will once again take center stage. This is what our dedicated community of Call of Duty players and Sledgehammer Games, who has been developing this year's title, are the most excited about. The Call of Duty community remains strong, and Call of Duty is the most successful video game franchise of the last 20 years. Overall franchise MAUs were stable in Q4 as players engaged on multiple titles. Life to date, on current gen consoles, Call of Duty alone has three of the top ten games. This demonstrates the value of year round engagement and live operations on both new releases and our highly engaging prior releases. Activision also released Skylanders Imaginators during the fourth quarter, an innovative new game that allows players to create and play their very own Skylanders. The game has delighted kids around the world, and has grown the franchise to become the 11th biggest console franchise of all time with more than 300 million toys sold. Based on this franchise strength, our film and TV division launched its first initiative, Skylanders Academy on Netflix in October, which has been very well received. The second season will be delivered later this year, and Netflix has already ordered a third season. In 2017, rather than releasing a new console title, we will be supporting the award-winning Skylanders Imaginators with multiple adventure packs, new characters and new in-game content. We are also excited to bring Skylanders Imaginators to Nintendo Switch as a launch title next month, and we have a new Skylanders mobile game in development. Now turning to our second strategic pillar, deepening engagement. Our compelling games, deep gameplay and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also strong engagement with over 10 billion hours of playtime in Q4. Our 43 billion hours of engagement in 2016 was on par with Netflix and 1.5 times Snapchat. And importantly, we own our content. Blizzard's Q4 playtime sets a new record, breaking the previous record set in Q3. During the fourth quarter, Overwatch had its second and third seasonal events, Halloween Terror and Winter Wonderland, showcasing the successful year round event-based approach to content. Each successive event drove new engagement records, including the most recent Lunar New Year event. And Overwatch has more exciting content coming. Blizzard's increased investment in World of Warcraft development resources is paying off through a more regular content cadence for players, with two patches released since Legion launched. This has resulted in higher engagement for the franchise, with an increase in total playtime for the quarter surpassing Legion's launch quarter, and all non-launch quarters in the last four years. More content is coming later this year, as the full Legion story unfolds. King's player base continues to be highly engaged with time spent of 34 minutes per daily active user, an increase over last year, and last quarter. This was due in part to our increased focus on live operation efforts. King also released a new franchise sequel at the start of this year, Bubble Witch Saga 3, which is off to a great start. Playing our games is just one way our players engage with our franchises. We recently announced our new Consumer Products division, headed by Tim Kilpin, a veteran of Mattel and Disney. Elevating our nascent consumer products business to a more strategic level is a great opportunity to provide our communities with more high-quality products and collectibles based on our own intellectual properties. Our audiences also connect with our franchises by viewing our games. In fact, Activision Blizzard accounted for five of the top ten most viewed games on Twitch in 2016. E-sports has become not only a catalyst for increased reach and engagement, but also a stand-alone opportunity. Our Major League Gaming division hit a number of milestones this year, including hosting tournaments for Call of Duty, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft, launching the enhanced viewing experience, integrating the MLG.tv player into Call of Duty, growing video viewers on social platforms like Facebook and Instagram by 50%, and increasing twice player engagement by over 60% year-over-year. Activision's launch of the Call of Duty World League sparked strong growth for Call of Duty e-sports. Activision doubled the 2016 prize pool to over $3.5 million across 16 hosted events. Millions of fans were drawn to the action with the 2016 season delivering 120 million video views, and more than twice the time spent viewing compared to last year's season. We look forward to plenty more action in the months to come. Last year, Blizzard held its tenth BlizzCon and celebrated its 25th anniversary. BlizzCon again sold out in minutes and drew a large global audience with over 25,000 in-person attendees, and 10 million people from around the world tuning in. Blizzard also sold a record number of DIRECTV pay-per-view tickets to fans wanting the full BlizzCon virtual experience. Blizzard announced the formation of the Overwatch League at BlizzCon. For fans, it will offer city-based teams around the world competing in annual seasons, with standardized schedules creating a consistent experience to build passion and allegiance. For team owners, guaranteed slots and clear rights will enable stability and transparency that they can invest in. For players, contracts, including benefits and a combine for player selection will open up the sort of career opportunities associated with traditional sports. The Overwatch League is being designed to bring a new era to e-sports with an epic entertainment experience for everyone involved. Blizzard feels it has the community passion in place and the required structure established to commence the process of selling teams and media rights for the Overwatch League later this year. We'll have more exciting news to share in the months ahead. In January, Blizzard kicked off its Heroes Global Championship and announced its upcoming third annual collegiate e-sports competition, Heroes of the Dorm, which will be streamed exclusively via Facebook Live, ensuring broader global accessibility to e-sports audiences. Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investments. In-game purchases were yet again close to $1 billion in the quarter, and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double last year's $1.7 billion. Even without the benefit of the addition of King to our portfolio, the company's in-game purchases would have grown 33% this year. World of Warcraft content and continued strength in Overwatch seasonal events delivered Blizzard's record levels of in-game revenues in the quarter and for the full year. Activision's record in-game revenues for 2016 were driven by a record-setting Call of Duty Black Ops III in-game content season where for the first time, add-on revenues were greater than DLC and Season Pass combined even with record Season Pass participation. Over the past several years, Activision has methodically and creatively evolved the Call of Duty business model, and this performance illustrates the impact those strategies have had in a relatively short period of time. It also showcases the virtuous cycle created when engaging content leads to more player investment. And this year is the first time we have three player communities at scale concurrently in Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III, and we will be supporting each of them with new content throughout the year. Destiny continues to have a large and committed audience, which is eager for new content and adventures. Activision along with their partners at Bungie plan to answer the call with the release of a full Destiny sequel later this year, designed to thrill our existing loyal fan base and bring many new players into the fold. We plan to support the release of the sequel, with a great content plan post launch, setting the stage for growth with this year's sequel and the content season that will follow. King continues to perform from a player investment perspective despite lower MAUs. Bookings per paying user has increased six quarters in a row to its highest level ever. Importantly, we saw stability in the Candy Crush franchise throughout the year, with fourth quarter and full-year mobile gross bookings increasing year-over-year for the franchise. We have also invested in a mobile incubation pipeline with multiple games for a number of our core franchises across the company. We will rely on our own talented teams and partners, and leverage King's mobile expertise. Some of these games has reached the prototype phase and we believe could drive growth in future years. We'll have more to share on our expanding mobile efforts down the road. So in summary, despite many opportunities for improvement, 2016 was by far our best year ever from what we've accomplished and for the groundwork we laid to realize the significant growth opportunities that lie ahead. Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Great. Thanks, Thomas. Q4 was another great quarter, capping off a record setting year. For the full year for the first time, we had over $1.5 billion in revenues on three different interactive platforms: console, PC, and mobile. Nearly $1 billion in Asia Pacific revenues and more digital revenues for the year than our prior record for total company revenues, all of which helped contribute to record non-GAAP operating margin of 35%, year-over-year EPS growth of 68%, and nearly $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. These results highlight the powerful combination of owned IP, a direct and increasingly digital customer connection and global scale. We're obviously very encouraged by this and believe we're only in the early innings of realizing this multi-year opportunity. Looking back, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results unlike our consolidated results are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. Blizzard had its strongest financial performance in history including record revenue up more than 50% versus last year, a record $1 billion in segment operating income for the year, up 81% versus last year, and record Q4 revenue up 46% versus last year. This historic performance underscores the significant progress Blizzard has made towards transforming into a multi-franchise, multi-platform and multi-geography company. In 2016, Blizzard had more than 60% of its revenues from non-World of Warcraft franchises, 20% of its revenues from non-PC platforms and more than 25% of its revenues in APAC. Activision's Q4 had strong catalog and digital performance from Call of Duty Black Ops III, which offset new release underperformance. Activision delivered record Q4 and full-year in-game revenues and the strong digital performance helped drive a record full-year segment operating margin of 35%. In 2016, King contributed more than the originally planned 30% accretion to our overall results. They continued to have two of the top ten grossing games in the U.S. for the 13th quarter in a row, and importantly, the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with an increase in mobile bookings year-over-year. Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter, we generated record Q4 GAAP revenues of $2.01 billion, $158 million above our November guidance, and $661 million or 49% above Q4 last year. The net effect of deferred revenue was $438 million for the quarter. We generated GAAP EPS of $0.33. We generated an all-quarter record non-GAAP EPS of $0.65, $0.25 above guidance. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.27. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven primarily by Overwatch and World of Warcraft as well as favorable adjustments to our tax rate versus guidance. In Q4, you saw the power of our diverse portfolio and year-round engagement model, where even with lower Call of Duty Frontline sales, we were able to deliver growth and record results. Turning to the full year, we generated record GAAP revenues of $6.61 billion, up 42% year-over-year, an operating margin of 21% and EPS of $1.28. The impact of deferred revenue was negative $9 million for the year. On a non-GAAP basis, we generated record EPS of $2.18, up 68% year-over-year. The impact of deferrals on non-GAAP EPS was $0.02 in 2016. The digital transition continues to be a nice tailwind for our business, and digital revenues in Q4 were an all quarter record $1.5 billion, double last year's figure. For the year, we delivered record digital revenues of $4.9 billion, up 94% versus last year. The primary driver for our digital momentum is the continued growth of in-game content. As Thomas mentioned, in-game purchases were close to $1 billion for the quarter, and a record $3.8 billion for the year, more than double the $1.7 billion we had last year. We believe we still are in the early days of this important vector in our business with more opportunity ahead. In terms of cash flow, our strong business performance has led to record cash flow generation. For the year, we delivered a record $2.2 billion of operating cash flow, up 71% year-over-year. For the quarter, we generated operating cash flow of $859 million. From a balance sheet perspective, we had a number of positive developments in 2016. The durability of our underlying business has driven continued credit rating improvement. During the year, S&P upgraded us to investment grade, and Moody's, who had upgraded us in 2015 concurrent with the King deal announcement, moved us up another notch. In August, we restructured our term loans, which allowed us to realize interest rate savings and in September, we issued new five-year and ten-year notes which replaced our prior 2021 notes at a more cost-effective rate. So, a very busy year on the capital structure front. Regarding liquidity, we finished the year with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments on the balance sheet, with almost $1.4 billion held domestically. Our strong balance sheet and cash flow have allowed us to return significant capital to our various stakeholders. Since 2010, we have repurchased $7.8 billion of our shares and paid out over $1.3 billion in dividends. In addition, since 2013, of the $7.1 billion of gross debt we have borrowed to fund the Vivendi buyback and the King transaction, we've already repaid $2.1 billion as of the end of 2016. Continuing on this trend, our board has once again approved a balanced approach to capital allocation for 2017, increasing our dividend by 15% to $0.30 per share payable in May, authorizing debt pay down of $500 million this year, of which we've already paid down $139 million in February, and authorizing a $1 billion stock repurchase over the next two years. Now, let's turn and look forward to our outlook for 2017. In 2017 as expected, we have a lighter slate of full-game releases. Given fewer major launches this year, we expect to build on our strong momentum on year-round engagement and in-game player investment across our portfolio. A few other things to call out. While strategically important, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch league and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. In addition, as we have said previously, we expect advertising to begin to contribute in 2017 and have a more substantial impact in 2018 and beyond. In terms of segments, we expect a more evenly-weighted contribution from Activision, Blizzard, and King in 2017 than in 2016. We expect Blizzard to have a lower 2017 performance given a lighter release slate. However, Blizzard has lots of exciting plans for live ops and additional in-game content for every franchise, including Overwatch, Hearthstone and World of Warcraft. For Activision, we expect to have lower performance in the first half of the year, given a smaller Call of Duty digital season compared with the record performance of Black Ops III in the first half of 2016. That said, we do expect a larger back half of the year as we release the Destiny sequel and a new Call of Duty title. We are enthusiastic about this year's Call of Duty release going back to its roots, and as such we are guiding it up in Q4 versus last year's Q4 performance. In addition, as Thomas mentioned, the Skylanders franchise will not have a full game console release this year, but we will continue to engage the community and drive player investment through new toys and digital content. For King, we expect to be modestly up year-over-year, mainly driven by a full-year contribution from the business, the introduction of advertising, and ongoing live ops across the portfolio. Turning to the numbers, on a GAAP basis for 2017, we expect revenues of $6 billion, including GAAP deferrals of $300 million, with product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 64%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $156 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 765 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.72. Our GAAP numbers include a $0.03 net of taxes GAAP-only restructuring charge, which is related to our continued transition to digital. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 47%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million. We expect a return to the historical tax rate of 24% as 2016's tax rate was lower due to discrete items and stronger international mix due to Blizzard's over-performance. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $1.70, including a GAAP deferral of $0.15. Please note that we expect more of a deferral impact in Q4 2017 than we had in Q4 2016 due to the larger expected launches of Destiny and Call of Duty in the second half of the year, part of which will be deferred into 2018. Also just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals, or $0.15, to our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.70 to get to our full-year 2017 number. Now let's turn to our Q1 outlook. On a GAAP basis for Q1, we expect revenues of $1.55 billion including GAAP deferrals of negative $500 million, product costs of 21%, and operating expenses of 60%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $43 million, and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 21%. We expect 760 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.25. For Q1 on a non-GAAP basis, we expect product costs of 21% and operating expenses of 43%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $39 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, including a GAAP deferral of negative $0.33. So in summary, 2016's strong performance highlights the tremendous opportunity and potential we have in front of us. The combination of leading owned IP, and franchises, a direct digital connection to our consumers, best-in-class content creation capabilities, and geographic platform and business model diversity provides an incredibly powerful engine for sustained financial performance. So while in 2017, as expected, we will have a lighter release slate, our strong business platform, combined with promising emerging opportunities like e-sports, advertising, and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. Now, I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my question. So looking at Call of Duty, I'm curious what the plan is for content this year, and whether for the Q4 release you intend to tweak anything based on the reaction to last year's version of the game. Thank you. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, Tim. Thanks. It's Eric. So the first thing I'll say is just that I think the most important thing is remember, the Call of Duty ecosystem is strong, and we continue to see very strong MAUs, and that this is the first time we'll have three active games with three different player communities at scale with Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagement for all of those titles with great content throughout the year. As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, with any longstanding franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things that people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue, over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any longstanding franchise in any medium. Last year I don't think we got that balance right. Infinite Warfare had a ton of great gameplay innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved, but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is, is that I'm excited to say that in 2017 we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with a game that our teams are incredibly passionate about, with a lot of great innovations, but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love. The game is being made by Sledgehammer, as Thomas mentioned. They're a proven team that's passionate about this title. We green-lit it over two years ago now, and they've been hard at work at it ever since, and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else we've got in the Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well, and we've never be more excited either creatively or commercially about our three-year Call of Duty slate. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Great. Thanks, Eric, and congrats on the quarter. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from Drew Crum with Stifel. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So for Overwatch, would you be willing to provide any additional detail on plans for content in 2017 and beyond? You made reference to live ops, but any additional detail there? And as far as the Overwatch League, any additional color on what you have in store for that? Thanks. Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Sure. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. First, we're very pleased with the launch of Overwatch and the player response to the content. We've entered 2017 with strong momentum. The game passed the 25-million-player mark last month. And each seasonal event that we run has set a record for engagement. Our plan is to continue evolving Overwatch with new hero and map content, new game modes, and additional events. We've seen very strong engagement in digital sales from these efforts last year. Looking into the future, we also see opportunities in areas like linear media and consumer product. We think that this will help deepen connections with the franchise and also expose Overwatch to new audiences. In addition, we want to create new ways for players to engage with the franchise through the Overwatch League. Esports is growing, but the ecosystem isn't always easy to navigate for players, viewers, or teams. So with the Overwatch League, we're working very hard to address those challenges. Our focus is on creating stability and participation for teams and owners, and accessibility of the content for fans. We'll have global city-based teams with a standardized annual schedule, creating professional, high quality content and guaranteed league slots for the teams. This is all built on a game that's easy to understand, with short matches, and great action. The core experience is very fun to watch, and there's already a sizable audience for it around the world. Based on this, we think that we'll see significant new business and engagement opportunities. We're going to start identifying team owners soon. That's our next step. And we're looking forward to holding our first combine and kicking off the League later this year. So with all of that said, we're very excited about Overwatch's future. Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks, Mike. Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Yeah. Operator And we'll take our next question from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey, good afternoon. For King advertising, can you fill in some detail on the testing so far and when we should expect that you get to a full rollout across the games and the player base? Thanks. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Mike. Here's Riccardo. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Sure. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc So, first of all, we have a large user base, but more importantly, it's a very engaged user base. You've heard earlier Thomas saying that we have more than half an hour of gameplay per player per day, and we think this is an attractive opportunity, a very attractive opportunity for advertisers. It's a very engaged user base. So at the last earnings call I said that we are very careful and protective of the user experience, and so we've been testing and we are testing several ad formats. We've been testing with very high quality consumer brands like Nestle or Fox in our key games. We've been testing in Candy and we've been testing in Candy Crush Soda Saga. And we are testing integrated ad formats, which are integrated in the gameplay and are supportive of the gameplay. And so far, the results have been very positive. They've been positive both for the players, with an increase in gameplay and an increase in ad spend, and they've been positive for advertisers. So we have seen completion rates, which are above industry benchmarks, and we define completion rates as when the player really starts a video ad and finishes the video ad. And further on, we have engaged third parties through third-party research to analyze the impact on players, and the result was that our ads stand out more when they are presented and shown on our platform, on our games than when they are shown on other platforms. So we are very pleased with the results so far. So we are continuing on our plan, and the plan for this year is, first of all, to continue to invest in building the technical infrastructure, and to continue building out the team. Secondly, we will continue to test various ad formats, and as we do so, we will also ramp up the inventory. So our expectation for this year is to have a positive contribution to the bottom line, and we expect to scale the impact on the bottom line in 2018. Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you. Operator And we'll take our next question from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate all the color on the digital revenue strength. I guess I'd be curious to hear about where you finished on full game download mix for consoles for the year and what are you expecting for 2017? Thanks. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Yeah, hey, Brian. Thanks. It's Dennis. Yeah, digital tailwinds have obviously been a huge and important factor across all of our businesses, and thankfully we have the diversity of being across multiple platforms. So having huge success on mobile, which is almost all digital, on PC which has over time become almost all digital, and then the last real holdout is really on console where full game download mix is still the minority of player purchases. In general, it varies based on title and region and audience type. So for a game in big and mass market as Call of Duty, you see a slightly lower percentage mix of digital just because it is so mass market. But it's now in the low to mid 20s, and that's up from zero three or four years ago. But in games like Destiny and Overwatch, we see in the mid 30s. And that trend is continuing every year where we see 5-plus percentage points of mix moving every year in terms of overall business mix. So it should be a nice tailwind for us and for others in the industry over the next few years as well. Thanks. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great, thanks. Operator And we'll take our next question from Doug Creutz with Cowen. Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC Hey, thanks. I think you got 300,000 Redditers to breathe a huge sigh of relief when you confirmed Destiny 2 for this year. Could you give any indication whether you expect that in Q3 or Q4? And then could you talk about what you and Bungie learned from Destiny 1 that's informing the design process for Destiny 2 and your plans for post-launch content? Thanks. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, Doug, it's Eric. Yeah, I think the best thing we can say about Destiny is that the development is going great, and it is indeed on track for release this fall. As for the particulars, we've got a big reveal planned. I'm going to let the game do most of the talking, but I'll give you some broad strokes. I think that our team and our great partners at Bungie are doing a very nice job on two fronts. One is if you're one of the millions of players who really invested in Destiny 1 and have put a lot of hours and passion into that game, you're going to love this game, and there's a lot more of what you love here. For anyone who either hasn't yet tried Destiny or hasn't played it in a while, we think we've made a game with the sequel that's going to have a lot for them to love, too. The cornerstone of that is a great cinematic story. That's been a real focus with a great cast of memorable, relatable characters, coupled with some very nice ways to make the game more accessible to a casual player, without losing anything that our core players love. We've made it more accessible to someone who just wants to have a great more casual first-person action experience. We're also going to introduce Destiny to a number of new people by going to some international markets that we haven't been in before. So I'm going to leave the rest for the reveal, but we're very excited about the game, and it'll be coming this fall. Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC As am I. Thanks. Operator And we'll take our next question from Chris Merwin with Barclays. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay, thank you. I just have one for Riccardo. If you don't mind just updating us on the game pipeline for King. I think you said in the past that you're mostly focused on developing King IP for the time being, but at some point does it make sense to take one of your established IPs from Blizzard or Activision Publishing and create a mobile version of that game that the King team can develop? Thanks. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Chris. Here's Riccardo. So over the past year, we have taken a much more focused approach on what content we develop and release. So this is in line with our goal to continuously raise the bar on innovation. Innovation is a major word for us. It is a major focus point. So talking about the King team, first and foremost we're focusing on the existing King franchises. So we have proven last year that our focus on live games, creating new content in the forms of live ops and new features has paid off, and pays off, and we've seen this in the growth of the Candy Crush franchise year-on-year on mobile. So we are continuing to invest in live games. Secondly, we are working on sister titles and sequels for our existing successful King franchises. We have launched recently, in mid-January, we have launched Bubble Witch 3, and we are extremely pleased not only with the quality of the game, but also with the response from the players and the acceptance from the players. And we are looking forward to scaling further this game in the year. We are also working on titles with much higher level of innovation for the long-term growth of the franchise, and we believe innovation is key for the long-term success. We're also working for the future on additional IPs in new genres with franchise potential, and here it's great to be part of the Activision Blizzard family, and we are very excited about the opportunities coming from working together on bringing established Activision Blizzard IP to mobile. And we're currently working on this, and the work is at prototype stage. We're also working with the Activision Blizzard team on marketing existing Activision Blizzard mobile IP on mobile devices, and that's where we can leverage the experience we have made on mobile, and the technique and infrastructure. So in summary, our resources are more focused than ever, on the long-term growth of our business. Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Operator And next we have Eric Sheridan with UBS. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thank you for taking the question. We saw the announcement of the consumer products division. We've certainly seen other companies like Disney turn large IP libraries into big consumer product businesses. Why now in terms of the consumer product launch? How should we think about that opportunity? And what should we be watching for over the next couple of years as that business rolls out? Thank you. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Great question, Eric. It's Bobby. I think Disney is a great example. They've figured out probably better than any entertainment company how to turn consumer products into a multi-billion dollar business, but also to increase the touch points for their franchises around the world. And so we've elevated consumer products to a new strategic pillar for the company. We hired Tim Kilpin who is a veteran of both Disney and Mattel, and we think that consumer products can accelerate growth by leveraging our IP and creating new ways for people to connect with our franchises, especially as we're launching our e-sports leagues. If you think about consumer products as they relate to the NFL or the NBA, these are billions of dollars of revenues for the leagues, and we think they'll be great opportunities for league and team merchandise. That'll be important components of what we do in the consumer products business. Generally, we think creating more consumer touch points in a low capital investment, high-return way, adds tremendous value to the franchises. So we think this is a great opportunity for the company, and we're really looking forward to expanding what we do in consumer products with Tim Kilpin. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Great. Thank you. Operator We'll take our next question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great, thanks. And this is a follow up question for Mike. I was hoping you could tell us a little bit more about the Blizzard pipeline as well, both in terms of full new releases and online expansions. And then any sense for the linearity of release timing would be helpful as well. Thanks. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Colin, thanks for the question. Well, last year was a really epic and important year for us, in addition to celebrating our 25th anniversary, we posted record results and have more people playing Blizzard games than ever before. We're very grateful for the passion and support of our players, and our commitment to delivering awesome content to them has never been stronger. So with that in mind, we've put in a significant effort into being able to support the type of longer-term engagement that Blizzard games have always delivered, but doing so now across more games on more platforms and in more regions. So we've really had to scale up our organizational capabilities to do that. This year, we'll have compelling new content across all of our franchises, as well as continuing to expand beyond the games with things like comics, animated shorts and more. In addition, we're always thinking about new game ideas, and we have several in the prototype phase, but not able to talk about those right now. As I mentioned before the Overwatch League also represents new business and engagement opportunities for us this year and beyond, and that's going to be a big focus for us as well. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Great. Thanks. Operator We have time for one more question. We will now hear from Eric Handler with MKM Partners. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Bobby, question for you. With League of Legends recently signing a $50 million year streaming deal with BAMTech, I'm curious, how do you perceive the value for your e-sports properties? Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Great question, Eric. I actually think it was a very important milestone for e-sports. It's a large-scale broadcast commitment, and I think it really demonstrates how valuable our content can be as spectator content. I think when we look at what the opportunity is for professionally-produced content, and as Mike pointed out, city-based competition around the world, which there really isn't an analog to, we think that if you look at where advertisers want to spend their capital, where sponsors want to spend their capital, it is very difficult to reach 18 to 35-year-old males today, and this programming is incredibly compelling. People are watching it largely as user generated content today. But we think the professionally produced content will have tremendous value, and we think this is going to be a big area of opportunity, again, to strengthen our franchises, but probably most importantly to really celebrate our players. Because if you think about the player investment that our players make, the time, the commitment, there's a great opportunity for us to showcase and celebrate our professional players, and we think there's going to be larger audiences and large numbers of advertisers willing to support those efforts. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC Thanks, Bobby. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again in early May. Operator And that concludes today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation.

And we'll take our first question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Yes, hi. Thank you for taking my question. So looking at Call of Duty, I'm curious what the plan is for content this year, and whether for the Q4 release you intend to tweak anything based on the reaction to last year's version of the game. Thank you. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, Tim. Thanks. It's Eric. So the first thing I'll say is just that I think the most important thing is remember, the Call of Duty ecosystem is strong, and we continue to see very strong MAUs, and that this is the first time we'll have three active games with three different player communities at scale with Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered, and Black Ops III. And the plan is we're going to be driving engagement for all of those titles with great content throughout the year. As far as the second part of your question, as I've said many times before, with any longstanding franchise like Call of Duty, there's a balancing act we need to strike between staying true to the things that people love about the franchise and also the need to never become complacent and to keep pushing for innovations to keep the franchise fresh and vital. I would argue, over a period of many years now, we've managed that balance on Call of Duty better than just about any longstanding franchise in any medium. Last year I don't think we got that balance right. Infinite Warfare had a ton of great gameplay innovations that many of our fans appreciated and loved, but it also had a setting that didn't appeal to all of our fans. The good news is, is that I'm excited to say that in 2017 we think we have this balance in perfect harmony with a game that our teams are incredibly passionate about, with a lot of great innovations, but that also has the traditional combat that we know our fans are going to love. The game is being made by Sledgehammer, as Thomas mentioned. They're a proven team that's passionate about this title. We green-lit it over two years ago now, and they've been hard at work at it ever since, and we can't wait to unveil it to the world soon. And without discussing too much about what else we've got in the Call of Duty pipeline, I can also tell you that we're confident our fans are going to love those games as well, and we've never be more excited either creatively or commercially about our three-year Call of Duty slate. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Great. Thanks, Eric, and congrats on the quarter. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you.

With League of Legends recently signing a $50 million year streaming deal with BAMTech, I'm curious, how do you perceive the value for your e-sports properties? Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Great question, Eric. I actually think it was a very important milestone for e-sports. It's a large-scale broadcast commitment, and I think it really demonstrates how valuable our content can be as spectator content. I think when we look at what the opportunity is for professionally-produced content, and as Mike pointed out, city-based competition around the world, which there really isn't an analog to, we think that if you look at where advertisers want to spend their capital, where sponsors want to spend their capital, it is very difficult to reach 18 to 35-year-old males today, and this programming is incredibly compelling. People are watching it largely as user generated content today. But we think the professionally produced content will have tremendous value, and we think this is going to be a big area of opportunity, again, to strengthen our franchises, but probably most importantly to really celebrate our players. Because if you think about the player investment that our players make, the time, the commitment, there's a great opportunity for us to showcase and celebrate our professional players, and we think there's going to be larger audiences and large numbers of advertisers willing to support those efforts. Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC Thanks, Bobby. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. All right. Thank you everyone for joining us today and we'll look forward to talking to you again in early May. Operator And that concludes today's presentation. We thank you all for your participation.

Today's call is being recorded, and at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Amrita Ahuja, SVP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Amrita Ahuja - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today for Activision Blizzard first quarter 2017 conference call. With us are Bobby Kotick, CEO; Thomas Tippl, COO; and Dennis Durkin, CFO. And for Q&A, Mike Morhaime, CEO of Blizzard; Eric Hirshberg, CEO of Activision; and Riccardo Zacconi, CEO of King will also join us. I would like to remind everyone that during this call we will be making statements that are not historical facts. The forward-looking statements given in this presentation are based on information available to the company as of the date of this presentation. And while we believe them to be true they ultimately may prove to be incorrect. A number of important factors could cause the company's actual future results and other future circumstances to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, including the factors discussed in the risk factor section of our SEC filings, including our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K, which is on file with the SEC and those indicated on the slide that is showing. The company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revision to any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today, May 4, 2017. We will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures during this call. However, as discussed on our July 29, 2016 conference call, due to updated compliance and disclosure interpretations issued by the SEC staff in May 2016, we are no longer able to present non-GAAP financial measures excluding the impact of deferrals. On this call and in the future, we will continue to provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of expenses related to stock based compensation, the amortization of intangible assets, expenses including legal fees, costs, expenses, and accruals related to acquisitions, including the acquisition of King Digital Entertainment, expenses related to debt financing and refinancing, restructuring charges, and the associated tax benefits. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. Please refer to our earnings release which is posted on www.Activisionblizzard.com for our full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and further explanation with respect to our non-GAAP measures. There's also a PowerPoint overview, which you can access with the webcast and which will be posted on the website following the call. In addition we will also be posting a financial overview highlighting both GAAP and non-GAAP results in a one-page summary. And now I'd like to introduce our CEO, Bobby Kotick. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you, Amrita. And thank you for joining us today. This quarter we achieved record revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow, and over-performed our prior guidance. The size and engagement of our community remains strong. We continue to invest in both in-game growth opportunities, as well as adjacent opportunities, like consumer products, advertising, and esports. One of our big priorities is to unlock the full potential of professional esports by opening the sale of teams and media rights of our leagues. Over the years, we've become a leader in creating world class competitive experiences, sustainable franchises that engage hundreds of millions of people around the world, through gameplay competition and connecting players and communities. This success is driven by our ability to tap into the timeless power of communities, anchored through organized competition. Throughout history, sports has helped bring communities together. City and country loyalties form the basis for spectator enthusiasm, generations of engaged audiences and traditions anchored in scheduled competitions. Until the 20th century though, sports like football, baseball and basketball were still hobbies for gifted amateurs. Then professional leagues emerged like the Premier League, the NFL, or the NBA. The value of sports in our everyday lives has grown exponentially, and so have the commercial opportunities that we see in sports. We actually believe the same opportunity to further professionalize esports now exists, and we think the impact can be as significant as the traditional sports we know and love. The franchises we've built over the years deliver competitive experiences as enduring as traditional sports, but with unique strength and value for brands. Our players are digital natives competing in almost every country in the world. The esports audience includes some of the hardest to reach and most sought-after demographics for marketers and advertisers, with the share of millennials two to three times higher than any of the big four U.S. sports. We're incredibly excited to launch the Overwatch League later this year. We believe by celebrating and rewarding our players, and recognizing their accomplishments, our professional players will become the role model and inspired competitors of the 21st century. The competitions we're creating around the world will attract sponsors and advertisers resulting in broadcast revenues, licensing, sponsorship and ticket sales, and most importantly, amazing spectator experiences. Through MLG, we're building the first dedicated global channel for esports, the over the top ESPN of video games. To put the Overwatch League opportunity in context, around 240 million people today watch approximately 7 billion hours of NFL content annually. This drives $12 billion in revenues including more than $6 billion in media rights revenues. The NBA today has roughly 175 million viewers watching around 2 billion hours total with more than $5 billion in revenues and a $1.8 billion of those from media rights. With hundreds of millions of people already watching esports and playing our games, over the long term our goal is to create opportunities that we believe could be of a similar scale. We're also going to combine delivery of our spectator content with unique advertising opportunities that includes the ability for advertisers to have better targeting and analytics, much more so than what you would see in traditional forms of broadcast advertising today. And with over 400 million MAUs and extremely high levels of engagement, our potential to generate meaningful advertising revenue is substantial. In particular, we believe our initiatives for advertising in King mobile games is a large and untapped opportunity and we're continuing to make progress with our testing and development of our ads platform, Ad King. Our results this past quarter demonstrate our ability to execute successfully against the many opportunities for shareholder value creation we have and as we have done for 26 years. And now Thomas will share the details on the quarter with you. Thomas Tippl - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thank you, Bobby. We're off to a very strong start this year. We delivered record Q1 revenues of $1.7 billion and record digital revenues of $1.4 billion. We grew year-over-year, over-performed our guidance for the quarter, and are raising our guidance for the full year. Our results continue to be driven by focus and execution against our three strategic pillars. First, expanding our audiences, second deepening engagement, and third providing more opportunities for player investment. Let's start with audience reach, which was 431 million monthly active users this quarter. Blizzard had 41 million MAUs for the quarter, up 58% versus last year and relatively stable versus the prior quarter, despite no new full-game releases. Blizzard's fastest growing new IP ever, Overwatch, continues to grow from an MAU perspective, setting another high water mark this quarter. In less than a year since launch, Overwatch has 30 million registered players and has become Activision's eighth $1 billion franchise. Hearthstone continues to attract new players as well, reaching 70 million registered players life-to-date. MAUs also grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter despite no new content in Q1. Activision had 48 million MAUs for the quarter, down year-over-year due to weakness in last holiday's Infinite Warfare release as discussed on our Q4 call. However, Call of Duty continues to have a large and active community of players across Infinite Warfare, Modern Warfare Remastered and Black Ops III. And we expect the community to grow with the next game in the series, Call of Duty: World War II, releasing November 3. When Activision greenlit this game more than 2.5 years ago, the team knew it was time to return the franchise to its roots, and fans are already sharing their excitement for Call of Duty: World War II. Activision revealed the game at a global live stream from London last week, which became the most watched live stream in Call of Duty history, and the reveal trailer has gone on to become the most liked trailer in Call of Duty history, and became the fastest video to reach 10 million views in Call of Duty history, which it did in one day. Additionally, though it's still very early, pre-orders are off to a very strong start. Call of Duty: World War II will deliver the gritty authentic cinematic experience, which Call of Duty is known for. Activision along with its partners at Bungie also recently revealed the much anticipated Destiny 2, which is set for release on September 8. Destiny was the biggest new video game franchise launch of all time when it was released, and early leading indicators including pre-orders for Destiny 2 are very strong as well. The team is taking great care in designing the game to appeal to existing and new fans, including PC players for the first time. Activision is also localizing the game for more markets, which should enable us to reach new audiences. And at launch, we're offering an expansion pass for Destiny 2, containing two future expansions, along with a continuous calendar of other events. Encouragingly, the SKUs that contain the expansion pass have attracted the majority of pre-orders so far. We believe the combination of a great game, the new opportunity to reach PC players, and a robust content plan post-launch highlight the opportunity ahead. We look forward to sharing more about both Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II in the months ahead. Turning to our next strategic pillar, our compelling games, deep gameplay and consistent follow-on content drove not only large communities, but also deep engagement with about 40 billion hours of gameplay over the past 12 months. Blizzard continues to see strong engagement from its players with time spent increasing by a double digit percentage year-over-year to a new Q1 record. Overwatch again had strong engagement this quarter thanks in part to the Lunar New Year event, which like the three seasonal events before it, drove record engagement in the game. Overwatch's latest seasonal event released on April 11. This event named Uprising included a player versus environment game mode, which drew record hours of player engagement, demonstrating that Overwatch can appeal to players beyond player versus player competition. In April, Blizzard also launched Heroes of the Storm 2.0, with a more powerful progression system, reward pack loot chests, and new battleground, and more compelling heroes, all of which brought players back into the game. Blizzard's strategy to release content and feature updates more regularly in World of Warcraft has been paying off with time spent up year-over-year, and with overall performance ahead of the prior expansion. At the end of the quarter, Blizzard released the game's second major patch since Legion came out with more content to come later this year. To round out the terrific performance of Blizzard's games, Hearthstone set a new all-time record in daily active users in April with the release of the new expansion, Journey to Un'goro. King's MAUs were down slightly versus prior quarter, but community engagement trends continue to set new highs with an increase in total playtime versus prior quarter. Time spent by daily active user is now a record 35 minutes. King also had the highest DAU to MAU ratio since 2013, with stability in DAUs versus the prior quarter. This performance shows that King's focus on live ops and new content for core franchises continues to keep our large and loyal audience engaged. And this bodes well for King's biggest growth opportunity, advertising. Esports is an important and growing engagement driver for our community, and there were many highlights this quarter. Activision held Call of Duty World League events in Atlanta, Dallas, London, Paris, and Sydney, and Blizzard kicked off the StarCraft II World Championship Series, Hearthstone Championship Tour, and Heroes of the Storm Global Championship with major international events, along with the third Heroes of the Dorm college tournament in Las Vegas. In addition, the Overwatch APEX League completed its second season in Korea and this year's Overwatch World Cup was announced as part of a busy year of Overwatch esports, as Blizzard gears up for the Overwatch League. And we have more to come down the road, including the recently announced CWL Championship. This is Call of Duty's biggest competitive event of the year, and will be held in August in Orlando with 32 teams from around the world competing for a prize pool of $1.5 million as part of the largest CWL season long prize pool to-date of $4 million. Turning next to the third pillar of our strategy, providing opportunities for more player investment. Blizzard saw an increase in total in-game purchases by almost 30% year-over-year, primarily driven by Overwatch and World of Warcraft, highlighting once again the virtuous cycle of engagement leading to more player investment, all of which starts with great new content. Later this month, Activision's Call of Duty: Black Ops III fans will be getting a new content offering called Zombies Chronicles, a remastered collection of the franchise's most beloved zombies content. This is our most significant new content update yet in the second year following a Call of Duty release as we now have better player engagement opportunities than we've ever had with our catalog games. King not only increased engagement, but also increased player investment this quarter. Bookings per paying user rose for the 7th quarter in a row to a new record. King continues to have two of the top ten grossing games in the U.S. for the 14th quarter in a row, and importantly the Candy Crush franchise showed continued stability with mobile bookings growing versus prior quarter. King has a number of projects in development, including a promising new publishing partnership with PlayStudios in the social casino segment, slated for later this year. This is an attractive mobile gaming genre and will allow us to provide great content for our existing player base, as well as attract new players to the King network. As we discussed last quarter, we also have a number of mobile incubation projects underway across the company, many of which are based on our proven IP. Since King became part of the Activision Blizzard family last year, we've been looking at ways to work together to create even more great gaming experiences for our large player network. Last month, we announced that King and Activision are partnering on the creation of a Call of Duty mobile game, and we're excited about the potential of bringing these two great teams together. In summary, we are off to a terrific start in 2017, with continued success keeping our large audiences engaged across a growing portfolio and on a variety of platforms. We are also pleased with the early momentum we are seeing for Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II and the continued progress on new growth opportunities, like advertising, esports and consumer products. We are excited about our prospects and stay tuned for further updates in the weeks and months ahead. Dennis will now review the numbers in more detail. Dennis M. Durkin - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thanks, Thomas. Today I will review our better than expected Q1 results, our outlook for Q2, and our raised outlook for the full year. Once again, we outperformed our guidance thanks to the strength of our global portfolio of owned IP, which delivered record Q1 revenues, digital revenues, earnings per share, and cash flow. To review the quarter, I'd like to first start with our segment results. As a reminder, our segment results, unlike our consolidated results, are still presented excluding the impact of deferrals as they always have been. At an aggregate level, combined segment operating income was up 41% year-over-year on an as reported basis. Operating income also grew on a pro forma basis, when including a full quarter of King last year. This is despite expected Call of Duty headwinds and shows the strength and broad diversity of our portfolio. As anticipated, Activision Publishing's Q1 results were down due to lower in-game digital sales. As mentioned on our Q4 call, we expect Activision to have a back-end loaded year with the two exciting releases in the second half of Destiny 2 and Call of Duty: World War II. King's relatively stable daily player base and continued growth in per-player engagement and player investment led to sequential revenue growth of 9% and an increase in operating income quarter-over-quarter. Blizzard's revenue grew 50% year-over-year, while operating income nearly doubled driven primarily by the success of Overwatch as well as strong continued engagement in World of Warcraft. So the strong 2016 tailwinds for the Blizzard business continue into 2017. Now let's turn to our consolidated results. Unless otherwise indicated, I will be referencing non-GAAP as redefined figures which include the impact of deferrals. If you would like to calculate metrics as we used to report them, you would add the impact of deferrals to our non-GAAP as redefined figures. Please refer to our earnings release for full GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. For the quarter we generated record Q1 GAAP revenues of $1.73 billion, $176 million above our February guidance, and $271 million or 19% above Q1 last year. This includes the net recognition of deferred revenues of $530 million for the quarter. We generated record GAAP EPS of $0.56 and record non-GAAP EPS of $0.72 in Q1, which was $0.21 above guidance. These figures include the net recognition of deferrals of $0.41. The over-performance in the quarter versus guidance was driven by a combination of business over-performance as well as timing of expenses. Our digital revenues once again grew to a Q1 record, $1.4 billion, up 50% versus last year. The strong digital performance led not only to year-over-year operating margin expansion, but also strong cash flow generation. We delivered record Q1 operating cash flow of $411 million, up 22% year-over-year. From a balance sheet perspective, we paid down $500 million of debt in Q1, ending the quarter with $4.4 billion of aggregate debt outstanding. We finished the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion in cash and investments, with about $1.3 billion held domestically. And next week on May 10 we plan to pay a cash dividend of $0.30 per common share, a 15% increase over 2016, to shareholders of record from the close of business on March 30, 2017. Now let's turn to our slate and outlook for Q2. Our Q2 slate includes one of Blizzard's busiest stretches of in-game content releases, including momentum from the March 28 World of Warcraft content update; a new Hearthstone expansion, Journey to Un'goro; the Overwatch Uprising event; and the Heroes of the Storm 2.0 launch with more content to come in the upcoming months. King will continue to drive live ops across its portfolio, albeit with some typical seasonality expected in Q2. Activision expects to release Call of Duty's second map pack as well as a free update in Destiny. In addition, they will launch new zombies content for Black Ops III, as well as new content and updates across the portfolio to keep players engaged while at the same time beginning the ramp in sales and marketing spend for our major releases later this year. For Q2 on a GAAP basis, we expect net revenues of $1.425 billion, including the net recognition of GAAP deferred revenues of $225 million, product cost of 23%, and operating expenses of 64%. We expect GAAP interest expense of $37 million, a tax rate of 26%, GAAP and non-GAAP share count of 764 million, and EPS of $0.15. For Q2 on a non-GAAP as redefined basis, we expect product costs of 23%, and operating expenses of 48%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $36 million, tax rate of 24% and non-GAAP EPS of $0.38, which includes the net recognition of GAAP deferrals of $0.11. Just to remind everyone, if you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS guidance of $0.38 and remove the net recognition of deferrals for $0.11. Now to our 2017 full year outlook. Though it is still early in the year and we have a lot left to deliver, including our major launches in the second half of the year, we are raising our full year outlook. Also, as we mentioned on our last call, emerging new revenue streams like team sales for the Overwatch League and the associated media rights are not embedded in our current guidance. On a GAAP basis, we expect revenues of $6.1 billion including GAAP deferrals of $230 million, product cost of 22%, and operating expenses of 62%. Our GAAP interest expense is expected to be $157 million and our GAAP tax rate is expected to be 17%. We expect 767 million fully diluted shares, both for GAAP and non-GAAP redefined, and GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.88, up $0.16 versus our previous guidance. For 2017 on a non-GAAP basis as redefined, we expect product costs of 22% and operating expenses of 46%. We expect non-GAAP interest expense of $149 million, a tax rate of 24%, and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80, up $0.10 from our previous guidance, including a GAAP deferral of $0.08. If you would like to calculate non-GAAP metrics as we used to report them, you would start with our non-GAAP as redefined EPS of $1.80 and add the impact of deferrals, or $0.08. So in summary, 2017 is off to a very strong start. Our record performance and cash flow generation speak to the strong year-round trends in our core business. We have a lot left to deliver later this year, but we are seeing some promising early data points on our two major launches ahead with Call of Duty and Destiny. Our strong owned IP portfolio combined with promising emerging business opportunities like esports, advertising and consumer products provides us with a compelling opportunity for growth in 2018 and beyond. And as always, with so many great opportunities ahead of us, we remain focused on operational excellence, capital discipline and long term shareholder value creation. Now I welcome our business leaders, Eric, Mike, and Riccardo as they join us for the Q&A portion of the call. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And at this time, we'll take a question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Yes, so first congratulations on the quarter, and thank you for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could provide more detail on the Call of Duty: World War II release this November, and maybe specifically what you have planned to bring more players into the game. Thanks. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, thanks, Tim. Maybe the easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start. But we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the live stream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like to dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is the – that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we – was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated at about 0.2% at reveal. So, I think, we're going to have a great game. And I think we have the right game at the right time. Obviously there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously we have a lot of confidence in what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: World War II, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we – I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be excited to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years. Operator And this time we'll take a question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks, guys. My question for Bobby or Mike around Overwatch, and you must be encouraged by the pace of growth with the user base. I'm wondering just how large of a market opportunity you think there is for this game, how you plan on maintaining that pace of growth, and on a related note if you could provide an update on the progress of the Overwatch League, including timing of league sales and kick off of the league. Thanks. Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Colin. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. So right now we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we release new types of gameplay through our seasonal events. And we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia as well as our strong presence on both PC and Console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out of game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful in fueling passion for the game's lore. And we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months and I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Yeah, as far as the team selling process is concerned, Colin, if you look back at the history of when we started this, it was really building a structure that would allow us to celebrate, recognize, and reward our players, and that was our principal priority. What we've come to realize is there's a big commercial opportunity potentially as well. So we've got a great team assembled with people from places like ESPN, Fox Sports, the NFL, the NBA. We've been out meeting with prospective team owners, both endemic teams as well as professional sports team owners, and the reception has been terrific. We'll be announcing our key city sometime later this year and give a little bit more detail into what the play schedule will be. But not for another few months. Operator Let us now move to San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Hi. This question is for Riccardo. Can you tell us a bit more about King engagement, what you're focused on at this point? And how you think by driving that business, you're growing engagement. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi Phan. It is Riccardo. So engagement has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we are very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in last quarter was around 35 minutes per day. And this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So, great results. And it's also great result that create engagement, it translates into how you're monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per pay year have gone up for the seventh consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new fresh content in the live games, and we do – we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific timeframe. And this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do then, we also release features, which are permanent. So that they are impacting the gameplay for the long term. And both of those – the content releases are in the live games. What we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross promoting players from one game to the next game. And by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game but at network level. And then of course we release new games and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year. And the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch, and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier, Thomas, we have now – we're also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with PlayStudios, which will go live towards the ends of the year. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator At this time, we'll take a question from Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities. Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities Thanks. So given Blizzard's slate this year, with less full games being released, just curious how you think about the content to help keep the community engaged throughout the year and how you think about the monetization of that engagement? Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Evan, this is Mike. So, yeah, this year for Blizzard represents a new type of pipeline, one that's not necessarily based on full game launches, but instead on delivering new content updates for our games. This quarter, we have meaningful new content for every franchise in our portfolio. In fact, a few weeks ago we set a new DAU record on the back of these new content updates. This reflects the evolution of our business from focusing primarily on full game releases to also providing a consistent stream of content for our players. Even without any full game launches this year, we're continuing to add to the depths of our games to serve a very highly engaged community with more content across our portfolio than we ever have before. Operator At this time we'll move to Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thanks, good afternoon. Looks like King has posted some developer job openings for Call of Duty mobile game. Can you provide us with any more detail on the game and your plans with that going forward? Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Sure, I'll start. Riccardo, then maybe you can jump in. So, yeah, Thomas mentioned King and Activision are teaming up to build a Call of Duty mobile game from the ground up. And the goal is to take a brand that tens of millions of people know and love and reinterpret it in a way that is appealing to the mass mobile audience. And we think it's a big opportunity. With King's experience making massively accessible and engaging games for that platform, and Activision's experience building one of the most enduring and appealing and engaging gaming franchises ever, we think we have the right combination of skills to pull it off. But obviously it's very early days. But that's the goal. Riccardo? Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Mike. So I believe if I may I will add a couple things to what Eric just said. First of all, and most importantly, and I'm talking here for the entire King's team. I'm super excited about this incredible opportunity, and to work together with the incredible team at Activision Publishing. One of the things which really excited us when we joined the Activision Blizzard family was the strength of the team on one side and the incredible quality and depth of their portfolio of games. And now we have the opportunity to work together on one of the jewels in this portfolio. So, this is super exciting. Of course, as Eric was saying, it's still early days. We are just at the beginning of this process and of the development, and it will take many iterations, as we know well, to create a game of incredible quality. But we are super focused on it. We put amazing people on this task. The target is to develop a game of broad appeal and to combine in doing it the experience of King of creating mobile games of broad appeal with the great experience in the genre and in the shooter genre of Activision Publishing and the experience of creating a franchise which has been around for a very long time. And so I believe that this is a really significant future opportunity, and I'm very excited to work together. Operator We'll now move to Doug Creutz with Cowen. Doug Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC Yeah, I wonder if you could give as much update as you can on when you expect to rollout advertising to the King user base, and maybe talk about what some of the gating items are to do that? Thank you. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi, Doug. So advertising is still in beta. In Q1 of this year, we've been doing further testing. We've built the internal capabilities, and we've built the team and are continuing to build the team. Currently, we are testing in seven titles, including some of our largest titles, with Candy, Candy Soda, and Farm Heroes. And we're testing different ad formats to ensure that we have the best possible player experience and also to ensure that we have the best possible return for our advertisers. We're seeing that in the market there's incredible demand for high quality mobile video ad symmetry, and we continue to be very excited about this opportunity, because we think we are in a very strong position both because of the size of the network and as you've heard before, because of the engagement of our players. So as we said earlier this year in – at our last earnings call in February, we expect to become profitable with this business line, with advertising this year, and to scale up the business in 2018. Operator Our final question today will be from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. A question on Destiny. Can you just talk a little bit about your expectations for Destiny in the new guidance given the dual platform, console and PC release? And then talk a little more about the digital and the MTX innovation you see coming with the title and what type of contribution you expect in that? Thanks. Eric Hirshberg - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Thanks, Brian. Well, the community's reception to the reveal was obviously awesome. And after four weeks, Destiny 2 pre-orders are tracking amongst the top in Activision Publishing's history. So the most important thing for this franchise beyond delivering a great game, which Destiny 2 is definitely going to do, as we talked about in the past, is getting the content pipeline right. Destiny's engagement has been the best in Activision's history. And we now have a lot of confidence that we're going to be able to keep up with demand with that steady stream of great content to sort of keep pace with our player's engagement post the release of Destiny 2. So as you know from our past comments on previous calls on – with Destiny 2's content, we're coupling Bungie's great visionary leadership with multiple AAA developers that have a proven track record here at Activision to help us make sure that we have just one great piece of new content after another to keep the community engaged. And that's the most important answer to the second part of your question. We've shown that when we have great engagement, great business follows. So with respect to PC, which you asked about, we're committed to delivering meaningful features that are bespoke for the PC community and I'm really excited about what we have to show for them. But I'm going to leave the details of those for our gameplay premiere event which is happening on May 18. And we'll have some additional, obviously, exciting announcements on the game overall at that time as well. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. All right. Thanks, Brian, and thanks everyone for joining us today. We'll look forward to seeing many of you at E3 or on our earnings call this summer. So thank you.

And at this time, we'll take a question from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies. Timothy L. O'Shea - Jefferies LLC Yes, so first congratulations on the quarter, and thank you for taking my question. So I was just wondering if you could provide more detail on the Call of Duty: World War II release this November, and maybe specifically what you have planned to bring more players into the game. Thanks. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hey, thanks, Tim. Maybe the easiest way to answer the question is to go a little deeper into the data that Thomas started to share on our prepared remarks. Preorders, as Thomas said, are off to a very strong start. But we also track a number of other softer measures to indicate strong positive interest in the game and we're off to a great start with most of those as well. The reveal trailer has become the most liked video in Call of Duty history, and also now has the most organic views of any Call of Duty reveal trailer we've ever made. We also set a new high watermark with the views of the live stream. That's both for Call of Duty and for Activision overall. And the livestream also was extremely positively received, with a 95% like to dislike ratio. And then probably equally important as the positive indicators is the – that the negative social media sentiment, which you know we – was an issue last year, has virtually evaporated at about 0.2% at reveal. So, I think, we're going to have a great game. And I think we have the right game at the right time. Obviously there's a lot of thirst from the community to go back to boots on the ground, but we didn't stop there. We're also going to be bringing some real innovations to the game which are obviously designed to keep it fresh and make it even more appealing for more different types of players, and those are going to be on display when we bring hands on multiplayer to E3 next month, and that's only the second time in our history that we've done that. And for context, the other time was Black Ops III. So obviously we have a lot of confidence in what we're going to be showing. So early days, obviously, but we're off to a strong start. And while we're obviously only talking today about Call of Duty: World War II, I have the benefit of knowing what we have in the pipeline, and I think that we – I've got a lot of confidence that our fans are going to be excited to play all the games that we've got cooking up for them over the next several years. Operator And this time we'll take a question from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird. Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. Thanks, guys. My question for Bobby or Mike around Overwatch, and you must be encouraged by the pace of growth with the user base. I'm wondering just how large of a market opportunity you think there is for this game, how you plan on maintaining that pace of growth, and on a related note if you could provide an update on the progress of the Overwatch League, including timing of league sales and kick off of the league. Thanks. Michael Morhaime - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Hi, Colin. Thanks for the question. This is Mike. So right now we're heading towards Overwatch's launch anniversary later this month, and we're incredibly happy with the community that's developed around the game, how many people have already tried the game and how they're staying with us nearly a year after the launch. Our first quarter MAUs were higher than we've seen all of last year, so that's great. We've seen new players come into the game when we release new types of gameplay through our seasonal events. And we have a lot of opportunities to continue doing that. We're also pleased with how successful Overwatch has been globally across the Americas, Europe, and Asia as well as our strong presence on both PC and Console. But we're tapping into the biggest genre in the world, so we think there's still a lot of room for growth across both regions and platforms. We think the Overwatch IP is incredibly strong and has potential across a number of different mediums. Our out of game linear media via comics and animated shorts has been really successful in fueling passion for the game's lore. And we think there's an ongoing opportunity there as well. Our existing esports community is really strong and it's growing. The Overwatch League is poised to accelerate that even more. So we're early in Overwatch's story with many growth opportunities still ahead. As far as the Overwatch League timing, we are working to launch the league later this year. You'll hear more about that in the coming months and I can turn it over to Bobby to talk a little bit more about how the team sales process is going. Robert A. Kotick - Activision Blizzard, Inc. Yeah, as far as the team selling process is concerned, Colin, if you look back at the history of when we started this, it was really building a structure that would allow us to celebrate, recognize, and reward our players, and that was our principal priority. What we've come to realize is there's a big commercial opportunity potentially as well. So we've got a great team assembled with people from places like ESPN, Fox Sports, the NFL, the NBA. We've been out meeting with prospective team owners, both endemic teams as well as professional sports team owners, and the reception has been terrific. We'll be announcing our key city sometime later this year and give a little bit more detail into what the play schedule will be. But not for another few months. Operator Let us now move to San Phan with Mizuho. San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc. Hi. This question is for Riccardo. Can you tell us a bit more about King engagement, what you're focused on at this point? And how you think by driving that business, you're growing engagement. Riccardo Zacconi - King Digital Entertainment Plc Hi Phan. It is Riccardo. So engagement has always been and continues to be a key priority for the company. And as you've seen from what Thomas was saying earlier, we have very positive trends and we are very happy about these positive trends. The average time played per player in last quarter was around 35 minutes per day. And this has been an increase both towards the last quarter and also versus the same quarter of the previous year. So, great results. And it's also great result that create engagement, it translates into how you're monetization. And we have seen here that bookings per pay year have gone up for the seventh consecutive quarter. So we have reached a new record level. Now what do we do to drive engagement? We do a few things. First of all, we release new fresh content in the live games, and we do – we call it live operations, which basically means this content is temporary, limited in time, and only available for a specific timeframe. And this makes it particularly attractive. And what we also do then, we also release features, which are permanent. So that they are impacting the gameplay for the long term. And both of those – the content releases are in the live games. What we also do is we then leverage the network of games we have by cross promoting players from one game to the next game. And by doing so, retaining and increasing the engagement, not only in the single game but at network level. And then of course we release new games and we have released Bubble Witch Saga 3 in January of this year. And the launch went very well. We are very pleased with the results of the launch, and we're very pleased with the high quality of the game. And as you have heard earlier, Thomas, we have now – we're also entering a new genre of games with the partnership with PlayStudios, which will go live towards the ends of the year. San Q.

(NASDAQ: SIRI ) 2017 Deutsche Bank Media, Internet & Telecom Conference Call March 07, 2017 03:05 PM ET Executives David Frear - CFO Analysts Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Bryan Kraft Okay, all right. Thanks everyone for coming. I’m pleased to introduce David Frear, Chief Financial Officer of Sirius XM. Thanks for joining us today, David. David Frear Thanks for having me, Bryan. Bryan Kraft David, why don’t we just start with some of the key drivers. I think a key driver of the success you’ve had in sustaining and even growing that net add levels over the past few years has been the used car channel. How much more growth is there in the used car side of the business, as you can continue to expand trial programs, other things like service lanes and some of the targeting efforts that you deploy? David Frear I think, the used car channels got a decade of growth ahead of it. I think we’re at -- about 75% penetration is new cars today. And eventually, the used car market will get to the same sort of penetration level. But, it will take at least 10 years to get there because current turnover is just once, the turnover two to three, four times. So, I think we are starting right about 30, 31%. And it’s going to be a long march to get to the same penetration rate. And of course the volumes are significantly higher in the used car markets. Bryan Kraft And what are the priorities for growing used car channels further? I mean, you talked of the natural rate of car turnover and how that affects it. But, you’ve done a lot of things proactively to create those used car channels in those funnels. So, can you talk a little bit about what those priorities are and what the levers are that you are trying to pull here. David Frear True. So, it was -- you start with low hanging fruit, right. And it’s all about data collection and trying to get close to the point of transaction, the point of sale. And so, the easiest place is to start with the OEM. We already -- we had new car programs with them. So, we worked with them to develop certified pre-owned programs. In those programs, they get the name and address from every sale, just like they do from new car sales, and then they could just include it in the new car feed they are selling. And then we set up relationships with the two biggest players in selling dealer sales system, something DMI and rental to rental [ph] and we probably signed up close to sort of 17,000 dealers through DMI rental to rental. And then we began going to other platform providers in the dealership market and we’ve now built that dealer funnel up to 26,000 dealers that report sales transactions to us. The incremental returns from here of growing that number aren’t that all that great because we’ve got pretty much all of the big guys and now you’re down to much smaller dealers left. And we’re following behind that with actually getting into the service pays as well. Alright, we have maybe 14,000 service pays signed up to offer trials now. The service pay doesn’t really gets you at the point of sale; that’s more about service point. And when a customer comes in to the bay, dealer can find out whether or not they’ve got an active subscription; if they don’t, whether or not they’d like a trial. And one of the things that we find we get from that is not only the opportunity to maybe remarket to them again, but we -- it’s unusual for us to learn about a new vehicle owner through that that we didn’t find through our reporting network of dealers. Maybe the last piece of -- and really to focus on capturing data here. The last piece of capturing data is going to be if we can have make inroads with insurance companies and finance companies that you do three things to buy a car that one you tend to go to a dealer all right. The two thirds of the market buys is through a dealer. You may be financing it; you are definitely going to get the insurance. And so, all of those different points of contact are ways of getting close to the sales transaction. Why do want to do that?  Huge difference in conversion, if we get close to the sales transaction as opposed to just use some other marketing technique to capture a new owner of the car. It can be 20 points of conversion difference between getting closer to sales versus marketing new [ph] fleet. Bryan Kraft And curious what you’ve been seeing in the direct self-pay gross addition part of the business. Do you consider this a growth opportunity or is it being sort of displaced by the expansion of the more used car channel? David Frear I think the answer to both those questions is yes, to the extent that we have greater success in getting at that the sales transaction that it actually shrinks the universe that is available to what we call our gross add win back team. But all that being said, the volume of cars we’re dealing with is huge. And while the business has been reasonably successful, I’ve said many times that for as successful as we’ve been, 6 out of 10 new car buyers say no, and two-thirds of the used cars buyers say no. And so that’s an awful lot of opportunity that’s sitting out there to be remarketed to by this gross add win back team. So, it’s still a large opportunity for us, the be big distribution channel. Bryan Kraft I think in the past, at times you’ve used some mass market tolls like pre-activation of everyone’s radios for a week or something. Curious as to how effective those have been; is that something that you expect to employ going forward or? David Frear Yes. I mean, it’s funny when you say it. Right? You have the reaction I did initially to hearing about it. Yes, sure, like that’s going to work. Right? Except that it does. And it’s an extremely low cost of acquisition. So, send an out an email or direct mail piece to say you’re in your free listening period and -- or you just slide up a radio and there are times when people just check back like the free HBO we can please to do. And so, it doesn’t take much of a response rate to make it a pretty profitable business. The customers are coming that way; they are little bit less committed users. And so, their sort of initial attrition rate is going to be higher after they get all to promotional plan. We have a higher attrition rate. But then, when they settle in, they’ll only be hit like a normal subscriber, again cost of acquisition is very low. So, it’s a great challenge for us. Bryan Kraft How, should we think about churn going forward? Despite vehicle turnover, self-pay turn hasn’t really increased over the past five years. And yes, I guess I’m just curious as to how sustainably you think that is? David Frear Well, I know -- I’m pretty pleased by the results because what it says is that the voluntary churn, which not to say involuntary churn is declining. So, the overall -- vehicle really in churn is rising. And so, I think it was -- I don’t know, maybe a year or so ago, some of the calls we talked about that some of non-paying and voluntary churn is being sort of in the 1.4% to 1.45% range. It’s actually come below, 1.4% is -- vehicle related churn has reason. But, the overall churn rate has stayed flat. So, I know we feel pretty good about it. We’ve got a big team of people that work hard to make that number happen. So, the stickiness to the service really seems to be playing out. Bryan Kraft Do you think conversion rates for new and used cars are also sustainable at current levels for the foreseeable future or do you expect some moderation in that as in car connectivity enables more streaming into the dashboard? David Frear So, the two-part question, right? New car consumer conversion rates, I think would be relatively stable. Penetration rate is not really rising anymore. And so, I think that would be relatively stable. And used car conversion rates, which of course won’t be affected by connected vehicle, at least not for a long time because we get 90 million vehicles out there that most of which aren’t connected cars. I would expect used car conversion rates to actually decline as our penetration continues to increase. As I’ve said many times that at around 30% level, the used car conversion rate is much higher than I ever thought it would be. So, I’m thrilled that I was wrong; I’ve been wrong for years. But I think as we move from sort of this 30% penetration rate inexorably up to 75%; that conversion rate has to come down. Bryan Kraft Yes, just because the car is getting older. David Frear Yes, exactly. Now on the connected vehicle side, we’ve been monitoring connected vehicle statistics for about five years now. We do a series of surveys. Population of connected vehicles has risen significantly over the last five years. And to be honest, we can’t find any difference in likelihood to subscribe that you can correlate to a connected vehicle. Bryan Kraft We’re a year away from I guess the first 360 all-equipped cars rolling out assembly lines. How excited are you about the new product and how do you expect to transform the user experience? David Frear So, I keep seeing demos. We do a bunch of demos with product at CES. And they continue to work on these. So, I thought that CES demonstrations were fantastic. And it’s a really well conceived product. I think consumer is going to like it quite a bit. It is an opportunity for us find way to sort of go beyond just one way service. And that ability to actually interact with the consumer whether it’s interact from a content perspective or interact from a messaging perspective related to their subscription that they are both just sort of great opportunities. So, I think the consumer is going to get a richer product experience, and we’re going to have a sharper engagement with the consumer in the vehicle and which I think will reap benefits of both conversion rates and churn rates. Bryan Kraft How quickly till it reaches critical mass from a production standpoint? I know it’s going to take a long time to obviously build up in the base but from a production standpoint, how quickly do you think you can have that curve… David Frear We found that -- you’ve always found this to be I think very relative to talk about OEM plans, and they can be difficult to predict. So we know what the plan of record is for what we know the product for a whole bunch of OEMs. And you are right; there is N OEMs that will be rolling out in about a year. And then there is modeling [ph] coming a little bit behind that and then there is few more coming a little bit beyond that. But that little behind that, it can move by half a model year or model year over other issues to do if there is supply chain. From a software delivery perspective, we’re be ready. We’ll have fully production ready platform by the fall. And so, then, it really just comes down to operationalizing with the OEMs and that’s very much outside our control. Bryan Kraft One question I had on 360L is I think if I understand it correctly, it’s being integrated basically on a native basis for lacking better term into touch screens in the cars. And I was curious if you would also integrate it or think about integrating it into the Apple and Android operating systems within the car? David Frear So, the answer is yes. And it all depends on how the OEM is implementing. And so, there’ll be no problem with implementing 360L in through Android auto or CarPlay, if that’s the way the OEM is going. Bryan Kraft Okay, all right. Do you think you’ll ever get a deal with Tesla? David Frear We do, we have a deal with Tesla. Bryan Kraft You do? Okay. David Frear Yes. Bryan Kraft I was not aware of that. David Frear Yes. I’m not going to remember off the top of my head, what proportion of the vehicles we’re in. I know we’re only in vehicles that have a sunroof because Tesla doesn’t want an exterior antenna. And so the antenna doesn’t pick up signal well when it’s underneath metal. So, what would you put it underneath glass and it’s got that clear view of the sky... Bryan Kraft Shifting gears a little bit, how should we think about your pricing power and how you think about using in the future I think? You’ve always been careful about exercising it, but how do you think about going forward the pricing power that you have? David Frear I think you’ve heard us say for years, we don’t feel like we have a lot of pricing power. And if in fact we’ve done a lot of price increases over the years -- and we have a fairly complex price grid. There are a lot of different options in terms of content as well as length of subscription. And so, we’re always doing something in the price grid to tinker with it, that across the board price increases don’t work very well in our system because the communications cost is sort of overwhelming with doing it. I mean, you have to tell subscribers when you’re changing a subscription price. And across 25 million self-pay subscribers, they actually don’t want to go out and hit them all the same time. So, we tend to monkey with the price grid, a little bit over time. If you kind of boil it down and look back over the last sort of six, seven years as to all the different price actions we’ve taken, what you see is something just a little bit less than 2% ARPU growth that’s come out of that. And I think that’s the good way to think about the business sort of going forward that we’ll have this sort of gently rising ARPU, and we’ll continue to tinker with the grid. Bryan Kraft Streaming has been an increasing focus for the Company. Curious if you could elaborate on what percentage of your subscribers utilize out of car streaming and what the directional trend is on that? David Frear So, I might not be able to answer question quite the way you’ve asked, but let me go at it this way. Our subscriber base is I think more likely than the average payer out there in the country to destream [ph] that and they are also more likely to pay for streaming. And so, I want to say that one of the studies we did, I think 40% of our subscriber base had used Spotify at some point in time. And I think that more than 60% of our subscriber base had used Pandora. And so, there is -- streaming is a huge business now. There are over 150 million people using online radio on a regular basis, which includes all the streaming options and that’s quite obviously towards the size of satellite radio. So, it’s out there and it’s out there at massive scale. So, we started streaming our linear channels in 2004. And honestly, everybody at the Company believes in IP connected world and we wanted to extend beyond the car. And so, we’ve got that ability to do that. Now, as we go forward, 360L is a way to take the benefits of what you can do in streaming environment, combine it with what you can do with the satellite radio and capability to give a richer content experience and everybody has got a stream. So, by now, it’s just a matter of what business plan you put around the streaming. And we like to make money. So, so far, we’ve decided to charge for it. Bryan Kraft Are you thinking of or are you planning to incorporate the 360L experience directly into iOS and Android, so that when I use my phone for example, the interface actually in the app looks the same as what I have in the car because it’s very conducive to doing that? David Frear Exactly. And I think that 360L was initially an implementation to get into production in autos. I think you’ll see a migration of the app as well as the 360L product to be relatively seamless following the launch. Bryan Kraft Yes. And it seems like it’s a great way to increase usage as to make it exact same experience? David Frear Yes. Bryan Kraft I think the CRB hearings you said are going to begin in any April and expect the decision by December 15th, I guess statutorily to ask you. Is anything substantive changed since the last process that might impact the outcome, one way or the other? David Frear I don’t really think so. It’s one of these things that there are only three opinions that matter on this issue and it’s three judges who sit on the copyright world, the board panel. I think that the case that the music industry is putting on is very similar to cases they’ve put on the past. I don’t think that there is anything really new in it. They are asking for 23% rate; it’s not the first time they’ve asked for a 23% rate. And we’ll put out a case that we think those are good job, arguing for different rate range. So, we’ll see what the judges come out with. The fact is that the CRB has decided twice what the rates are, they’ve twice been already [ph] asked for from the music industry. And it’s been somewhat consistent with this view they’ve expressed of the upper end of a reasonable range of rates [ph] and being around sort of 12% or 13%. We’ll see as they -- what they think about the evidence presented to them this time around. And rather than projecting outcome -- there’re always three voters in this election. And so, we’ll go through the trial and we think we’ve got sort of a good case that we put on good experts, good facts, and we’ll find out in December what the vote is. Bryan Kraft So, the same three judges as last time? David Frear It’s the same three judges as in the webcaster proceeding, but the panel is two new judges from the last satellite radio decision. Bryan Kraft What are you doing from a content perspective this year and in terms of the lineup? David Frear Well, it’s funny. And no, I’m not going to come up with much of the way specifics through. And it is sort of a never-ending sort of creative exercise that goes on that Scott’s guys are constantly rolling out new ideas and new promotions for subscribers that we had a private concert with Ed Sheeran in New York last night. The shows we brought on to the protocol spectrum in the course of last year, which remain extraordinarily current have been great, got a lot of engagement. And Craig Ferguson has got a new show that he’s bringing, bringing it out that we’ve got new some channel launches coming up in summer time. And it’s hard to keep pace with the number of promotions. So, there aren’t any of the sort of blockbuster type things, because it’s -- I think that most of that we already have. But there’re a lot of changes at -- I don’t call it the margin, but there’re lot of changes in the program that simply keep the content lineup fresh with what current interests in the country are. The media landscape really never stops evolving. Bryan Kraft I want to talk about the connected vehicle market for a minute and the opportunities that you see there. Jim on the call talked about some third-party predictions of $1 trillion connected vehicle market on your last earnings call. So, it sure sounds like it could be a very big opportunity. But can you be maybe -- can you talk in maybe a little bit more specifics on how you’re thinking about that market, where you might be able to have an impact and be successful? David Frear So, it -- the most visible product in that market today is safety and security services. And so, that’s a business that we’re in through our connected vehicle segment. And I think it’s got pretty solid organic growth that the way that the OEMs are productizing an asset, those kind of services for a period of time are becoming sort of table stakes from the marketing perspective. And so, that’s good in terms of growing a corporation in the vehicle. The other thing about connected vehicles that is a market that is largely unformed at this point is that the they are now building the communications, the entertainment, the electronic modules in the car in a way that they are actually connected internally. And this wasn’t the necessarily the case several years ago where they might have one board in there for satellite radio, and another board for an AM/FM radio, and a different board for a modem, and different board for the BUS that runs in the car. And those boards didn’t necessarily talk to one another. And so even though you might put a modem in the car that because you weren’t sending any information to the modem from the other boards that you couldn’t get any of the information on the car. All the automakers now realize that it makes sense to connect things up until that there is lot of resources they can share in terms of memory and power management, CPUs and things like that. And so, there is going to be a richer and richer set of data that you are going to be able to get out of cars over time. And then the question is who is going to use it, how do you manage the platform? And then there may be some opportunities in that area for us as well but you would have to characterize that is very unformed... Bryan Kraft Any guess as to when those opportunities may become a little bit of more fully formed in terms of what they look like? David Frear There are a lot of what I’d characterize as pilots going on in the automotive industry now as -- and there is an awful lot of engineering resources going in where the OEMs realize the vast amount of data that they could provide, how do they want to collect it and how do they want to retain it and how they want to process it and who is a good user for that data. One of the things we have to remember is that the customer owns the car. And so the data coming off the car belongs -- I think most people feel belongs to the customer. So, you also have to have permission along the way. But with -- it’s an enormous amount of data. And I think part of this is that people have to actually see it work with it little bit come and [ph] decide what they think can really be done with that. Usage base -- insurance is a kind of commonly quoted way of using that data and that’s a good one and but there are a lot more as well. Bryan Kraft Can you talk about the path to bring the legacy Sirius spectrum and what are the opportunities for utilizing spectrum do you see long-term? David Frear So, I think that these -- so, we have the high-band and the low-band. And they simply refer to out of the 25 megahertz spectrum that there is 12.5 that’s little bit higher and 12.5 little bit lower. So, the first generation of change that we’ve got going on is just moving to what was the XM chipset, which focuses on high-band. And we will have all the automakers over to that chipset in by another three years. And so, the low band vehicles on the road are reaching their peak now. We’ve got a whole bunch of people migrate to it. And from here, I think the low band vehicles on the road will sort of slowly but surely decline over time. In terms of when it’s that will be a monetizeable change as it relates to the use of spectrum, it really comes down to then okay, how many revenue generating radios we have left that can only hear the low band. So, that’s a lot today. But as we get sort of six, seven years from now that you’re finally I think going to be entering a zip code where you could say, you know what, there’s only a couple of million of those out there. And maybe it’s worth stopping uplinking all the same channels twice. Clearly that’s spectrum for other content, and you simply provide those remaining revenue generating radios with a substitute product which would affect the high band radio, so they can continue get their subscription. By the time you get to sort of nine, maybe 10 years out the outside, I think you have very few revenue generating radio slots. So, it’s sort of that period 2022 to 2025 roughly where you can make the switchover. Then the question is what is -- now it could be audio content, if autonomous cars really come in, it could be a lot of video. It is the spectrum that could be redeployed for other use in the wireless arena. So, what we’re doing at this point, since we don’t know how we’ll use it in 2022 through 2025 that we’re assuming that we will. And so what you’ll see coming in behind this switch of everybody off low band on to the high band is a wide band chipset and where we’ll have radios going in the cars that can hear kind of all of 25 megahertz in a single radio. And so, we’ll maintain the optionality of the fleet on the road through a dramatically expanded suite of content. And then we can make the decision on what that content looks like when we get more proximate to that day, because one thing’s for sure, media taste of the country will change between now and then. Bryan Kraft The NOLs are now over 3 billion. I guess, just curious at this point, assuming no change in the tax, when do you think they’ll become a material cash tax there? David Frear Well, federal tax is sometime in 2019. Bryan Kraft How should we think about your appetite for acquisitions? David Frear Well, we obviously have a lot of excess capital. And so, the financial flexibility to do acquisitions is there -- the challenge we’ve had with it so far is that we haven’t had many that are really strategic, that really do something to sort of advance the business. And we have such strong business model that a lot of things that are out there to acquire just out what is attractive. So, given that we have this opportunity where the satellite enabled vehicles on the road is going to double in the next 10 years, we have a huge amount of growth to manage within the core business. And as we look at acquisition opportunities, we want to make sure that they actually add something as opposed to just lock up our time. Bryan Kraft We have a couple of minutes left. Is there anyone in the audience who wants to ask the question? No one? Okay. How is the Board thinking about capital returns, as Liberty’s ownership increases? I mean is then approaching 80% threshold, is that something that the Board think about in terms of what happens once they get to a point of consolidation? David Frear I think if you kind of look at where we’re now and you can do the math how long it takes to get through 80%, you pretty much use all the NOLs by then anyway. And so, while you wouldn’t want to grow through 80% without a tax sharing arrangement, it’s not that material of consideration. Bryan Kraft Okay, alright. What about the cost structure of the Company? I think you guys have done a great job of containing the controllable cost,, particularly SG&A over the years where you’ve grown marketing, the G&A, how do you think about the cost structure going forward? I now you’ve - last year was a big year for resetting programming cost but how do you think about the programming cost -- about the cost structure going forward and margins? David Frear Couple of things, I guess. We continue to expect maintain about 70, 80% of contribution margin. And because subscriber acquisition costs are really entirely associated with new current installations, we have a fully recovered auto market, unit costs continue to come down a little bit each year that I think we’re going to continue to get margin expansion by over absorbing sack. And so the good news about that is that with high variable margin and then over-absorbing the sack that it gives us a lot of flexibility in terms of reinvesting in the business from both R&D perspective as well as marketing perspective. And so, all that we’ve than replatforming our app over the course of the last year, we’ve been doing three 360L development, we’ve got the live band chipset development going on that we’ve are building with satellites and we have strengthened the threshold radio network and we’ve done all that with expanding margin. We’ve also seen this expand margins, quite frankly we have dramatic expansion of number of trials that we’re running through. And so, it is one of these great things that we could probably drive margins, net margin, EBITDA margin harder than we have but for every dollar we generate, the first choice we are making is to try and reinvest it in the growth of the business and second choice is to redeploy it through acquisitions or return capital. Bryan Kraft All right. We’re out of time. So, why don’t we stop there. David Frear Okay. Thanks, Bryan. Bryan Kraft Thank you.

Good morning and thank you for participating in today's call. SiriusXM turned in a very good first quarter, and I am confident we are on track to meet or beat all of our financial and subscriber guidance that we issued in January. Once again, we are demonstrating the scalability and strength of SiriusXM's unique business model and the robust consumer demand for our very special content bundle. We grew revenue at approximately 8% in the first quarter to about $1.3 billion. We expanded adjusted EBITDA by about 14% to $502 million. This is the first time in the company's history that we've generated over $0.5 billion in adjusted EBITDA in a single quarter. And this quarter also marked our highest ever adjusted EBITDA margin at 38.7%, up 200 basis points from the same quarter of last year. Net self-pay subscriber additions were approximately 260,000, consistent with my expectations for the quarter. Paid promotional subscribers were roughly steady in the quarter on relatively flat auto sales. Churn rounded down to 1.8%, and new car conversion was 40%. Both very strong numbers, and within the range you've seen in recent quarters. We now have over 31.6 million paying subscribers, the highest level in the company's history. And as I mentioned, we feel very good about our full year guidance of roughly $5.3 billion in revenue, $2.025 billion of adjusted EBITDA, a $1.5 billion of free cash flow, and 1.3 million self-pay net additions. SAAR of the first quarter was solid at $17.1 million and nearly flat year-over-year. Most feedback I'm hearing from the OEMs on the economy, and auto sales is still broadly positive. Estimate for new car sales for the year remain in the low $17 million range, similar to the first quarter. Trucks and SUVs are flying out the door, but smaller cars are taking longer to sell. Our new car penetration rate was 75.9%, up from 74.3% in the first quarter 2016. Sales of SXM-enabled new cars climbed 1% in the first quarter to more than 3 million. The fleet of SXM-enabled vehicles climbed 14% year-over-year to 97 million, growing the pool of vehicles from which we can drive reactivations and used car additions. As a percentage of all used car sales, we estimate about 34%, so far this year have built-in SiriusXM, up from about 30% at this time last year. Our trial programs are now active at about 27,000 dealers, up from around 20,000 this time a year ago, with a bulk of the growth coming from independent dealers. Trial starts in the used car market are up 19% so far this year to a record 2.05 million, and we believe we are capturing a tad under 60% of vehicles turning over with dealer-based trials. Service lane is now active at more than 13,000 dealers, generating about 17 million data points in the first quarter alone. This helps us ensure our vehicle owner database is as accurate as possible, even as more vehicles turn over in the private market, which is naturally more challenging to track than dealer-based transactions. In short, I'm thrilled with our continued and very successful efforts to build distribution in the subsequent owner market. We expect many years of subsequent owner additions as penetration here arcs over the next decade from the mid-30% up to the new car penetration rate in the mid-70%s. This continues to be a strong growth opportunity for SiriusXM. SiriusXM today is a hive of creativity, innovation and experimentation. Our biggest technical initiative remains the development and deployment of 360L as our next-generation two-way platform for connected vehicles. As I've said before, the vision is really quite simple. We want to provide a seamless, easy to access, easy to use listening experience, no matter wherever, whenever and however our subscribers want it. 360L will help secure our dominant in-car listening position, and we are excited by the opportunity to offer car buyers and our subscribers the enhanced functionality and content enabled by this exciting new platform. And we're even more eager to demonstrate how 360L can improve our marketing and CRM efforts in particular, removing friction and making it easier to convert and up-sell our subscribers. We continue to expect initial deployments of 360L in select new vehicles in early 2018, so stay tuned. And note, our continuously improving app is a key part of 360L. With better apps and support from additional connected devices, we also intend to drive expanded listening at home, at the office, and on the go. As I've said before, we are very committed to seizing opportunities that are developing in the connected vehicle space and investing in this area. Along those lines, I'm also pleased to announce the acquisition of Automatic Labs, which we acquired a few days ago. San Francisco-based Automatic is a leader in connected vehicle data and analytics, and its connected car adapters provide a range of useful features like diagnostic alerts, emergency service assistance, fuel monitoring, parking assistance, vehicle tracking and many, many more. What's great is that Automatic's technology will enable us to target the vast majority of cars on the road today that have no connectivity. We think Automatic is a great fit with SiriusXM and furthers our capabilities in connected vehicles, as we open up new business opportunities in this space. We will continue to look for opportunities in this space, and we plan on giving you further updates about our connected vehicle initiatives and plans, as we head into next year. The competitive audio space requires us to remain at the top of our game, not just with new technologies, like 360L, but by also constantly reinforcing and improving the best bundle of compelling, timely and entertaining audio programming available anywhere. It is what our subscribers have come to expect from the leader in audio entertainment. We are focusing on new voices, exclusive programming, easy access to the best live sports, and special performances from world-class entertainers. Across our talk, sports, music and comedy programming, we continue to add unique personalities. Just this quarter alone, we launched shows with Brooke Shields, comedic TV star Jim Parsons and André Leon Talley of Vogue fame. In addition, late-night star Craig Ferguson started a daily new show, and debuted with a parade of star guests. We added a new series of shows from Stanford University and aired a stirring audio documentary about pioneering tech training programs for inmates called The Last Mile. Again, we hosted a special subscriber-only event that brought our audiences one-of-a-kind experiences, in person and on the air. Ed Sheeran performed at an exclusive subscriber event and broadcast just as the young star was setting industry records with the release of the new album. We provided subscribers the latest in EDM from our Music Lounge in South Beach, leading up to the Ultra Music Festival. And we broadcast interviews, reports, and performances from this year's Coachella music festival. We launched a new Las Vegas-based sports information network. We broadcast legend Brent Musburger, while continuing to give sports fans front-row seats and easy access to the biggest sporting events such as the Super Bowl, which we aired in eight languages, every game of the NCAA college basketball tournament, all four rounds of the Masters, and now the start of the Major League Baseball season. We reached a new long-term renewal with NASCAR, giving our listeners live access to every race through 2022 and bolster our coverage with a new show hosted by star NASCAR driver Kevin Harvick. The year is still young, but I feel very good about our progress so far. We are busy developing new platforms, searching for new and interesting content, and continuing the day-to-day execution you've come to expect from our team. As I said, we are on track to meet or beat the initial guidance we have given you and we continue to thoughtfully invest in our business, deploy our free cash flow to our shareholders, and make selective and targeted acquisitions. With that, I'll turn it over to David. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone and thanks for taking the time today. The top of the funnel has never been stronger for us. Strong new car sales, strong penetration and a rapid expansion of our used car dealer network delivered a trial funnel of nearly 9 million trials at quarter end. Total trial starts of 5.1 million in the quarter rose 8% while used car trial starts rose 19% to a record more than 2 million as our franchise dealer network grew to 17,700 participating dealers and the independent dealer network more than doubled to 9,300 participating dealers. New car consumer conversion rates in the quarter stood at 40%, an increase from 38% in the first quarter of 2016. Used car conversion rates held on to the 30% level despite fighting headwinds of an increasing mix of prior non-converters and an aging base of vehicles. Along with strong performance in fleet and rental conversions, we delivered a record first quarter for both OEM additions and self-pay additions. Churn rounded down to 1.8% in the quarter as reductions in both non-pay and voluntary churn rates offset pressure from an increasing rate of vehicle related churn. In the first quarter of the year, we added 259,000 net new self-pay subscribers, which brought the self-pay subscriber base to over 26.2 million and total subscribers to 31.6 million. We feel confident in achieving our full year guidance for net self-pay subscriber additions of approximately 1.3 million. Total revenue in the quarter was up 8% to approximately $1.3 billion on the strength of our subscriber additions as well as growth in ARPU. ARPU in the quarter was $12.95, growing more than 2% from $12.66 in the first quarter of 2016. Advertising turned in yet another great performance with 14% growth. We feel extremely good about our revenue guidance of approximately $5.3 billion in 2017. Contribution margin in the quarter was 70.7%, up 40 basis points versus the first quarter of last year with lower customer service and billing expenses from lower contact rates and lower agent rates and cost of equipment as a percentage of revenue more than offsetting higher revenue share, and royalty expenses. SAC declined from Q1 2016 as higher installs from our 75.9% pen rate, was more than offset by a reduction in SAC per install to $29. Fixed costs declined 50 basis points as a percent of revenue in the quarter. Together, all of this produced record adjusted EBITDA of $502 million, up 14% over the prior year period, resulting in a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.7% in the quarter, a 200-basis-point increase from the first quarter of 2016. Based on the strength of this performance, we feel very comfortable reaching our full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately $2.025 billion. In the first quarter, free cash flow totaled $249 million, down 24% year-over-year as a result of payments for satellites, a pre-1972 legal settlement and a shift in timing of automotive and interest payments compared to the first quarter of last year. Capital expenditures in the period totaled $53 million compared to $30 million in the first quarter of 2016 and we remain confident in achieving our full year 2017 free cash flow guidance of approximately $1.5 billion. The stock has performed well this year, opening the year at $4.49 and touching a high of $5.53 in March. In the first quarter, we spent approximately $300 million to repurchase 62 million shares and paid nearly $50 million in dividends to our stockholders. Total debt now stands at approximately $6 billion with no maturities in the next three years, and leverage is 3.1 times trailing adjusted EBITDA. After nearly a year of deliberation, last night, the CRTC in Canada announced they had approved the recapitalization of SiriusXM Canada subject to certain conditions which we anticipate meeting. We anticipate closing the recap in late May, Sirius will issue no more than 35 million shares in the recap and the cash component will probably be less than US$150 million and we'll know all this as the Canadian shareholders make their various elections by the middle part of May. We had $1.2 billion available under our revolver at the end of the quarter, and so we entered the quarter with ample liquidity to close the recap of Canada, the acquisition of Automatic Labs and continue investing in the business pursuing strategic investments and returning capital to shareholders. And with that operator, let's open it up for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. And we will take our first question from Barton Crockett with FBR Capital. Please go ahead. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. One of the questions I guess was about the confidence that you have in your 1.3 million sub adds for this year, and it's just kind of a basic question, but I mean you added 259,000 self-pay in the first quarter, you multiply by four and you're not hitting that 1.3 million number. So, what is it that you see that drives better sub growth later in the year to give you confidence in hitting your target? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Barton, this is Jim. First of all, I mean, obviously this is a number you can imagine we focus on daily, okay, and when I say we're confident, I want to reiterate we're confident in meeting or beating our guidance of 1.3 million. There are a lot of items that go into this, and I think that the timing of – we're still learning the timing of how used car deactivations are going to hit and when, and as we go through those numbers, and we look at our forecast out for the rest of the year, and what I think is probably certainly a consistent estimate for what we believe SAAR would be, all that points to certainly being able to add 1.3 million. David, do you want to add something? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah. Barton, 259,000 is right on the button for what we expected in the quarter, in our path to 1.3 million. So, for us, we are right on track. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. I mean, seasonally would you (19:11) second and third quarter to typically be much bigger than the first quarter? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think if you look back at the past, they generally have been that the first quarter has always been the low point. So, I don't think there's any year that you would take the first quarter, multiply it by four and get to the end of the year. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. And I think, Barton as you know, we've never given quarterly guidance on subs, but obviously we pay close attention to what the quarters look like, and look, I think that's all I can add there. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay, all right. And then to your acquisition, I know you guys are not giving a value for this, but I assume that means that it skews towards the immaterial side in terms of what you spent. But I was wondering if you could talk about maybe what the impact is on your financial statements from their business such as it is, that somebody will kind of notice or not and a little bit more detail on how meaningful you think it could become over time? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think nothing about the acquisition of Automatic would cause us to change our guidance for the year for EBITDA or revenue. What we spent out will be in the 10-Q, it's a little over $100 million to acquire it. And look, as we get in there and in future calls, I think you can expect to hear us talk more about it. But as it relates to revenue and EBITDA, it wouldn't cause us to change those measures at this point. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. Great, I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator And our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Thanks. Two quick questions. So, first just following upon Automatic Labs, can you give us a sense of what this actually brings to the consumer offering, it looks like it is a consumer facing product, just wondering how that actually gets incorporated into the SiriusXM product itself? And then secondly, can you update us on CRB and how we should be thinking about this particular round of hearings versus the last round? Thank you. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I'll take the first and David will take the second. What appeals to me about Automatic is, two things. One, they have a very interesting vehicle analytics data platform, that frankly we think has lacked significant investment and it's something that combined with our very large vehicle database can be leveraged into a very valuable asset, and we'll get on with those plans over the next several months. And so I would say that's less of a consumer facing advantage. It ultimately should, if it works out, generate revenue in some consumer facing way. Second though, they do have an adapter that they developed that we found to be quite impressive. They're already on their third generation of technology on that adapter and to amplify that a little bit that adapter at least in my mind would give us the capability to reach out to a mammoth number of cars, 150 million of the 250 million active cars in the U.S. and provide connectivity in a way that would provide connected vehicle services to those cars. We have a lot of work to do to understand what the right path to that option might be and what the speed towards that option would be, but that's what appealed to me about Automatic. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Amy, I'd just add, I think that you can think of it as having applicability in various industry verticals, some of which are – there are things that OEMs can benefit from these products. There are things that dealers can benefit from the insurance industry. It has a very strong interest in this product. There may be information that we can get back out of it depending on the car and what's happening with radio modules. And there may be other industry applications as well on top of the consumer offering. So, we're excited about what we can do with this. On the CRB side, so I am obviously biased on this one, right. So, I've been at three or four of these proceedings over the years providing testimony, but I honestly don't believe that SoundExchange has put on much of a case. And there are only three opinions that matter and those are the judges. And so what I think actually – I don't think you should necessarily take all that much from it, but there is a very strong record hearing prior proceedings about what the judges have thought about the upper bound of a reasonable range of rate. So I think that SoundExchange has come back in and for effectively the third time, it has presented the case, it says that we think the rate ought to be over 20%. And I just don't think when you look at their case, they've actually presented any evidence that would suggest that there is any difference here from the past. On the other hand, I think that there is a very strong link in the case that we put on that says, if you look at what the judges decided in the webcaster proceeding and that you (24:55) satellite radio that there is a very good case for rates going down based on decisions the judges have made about the value of sound recordings in other areas. So, what they'll decide, anybody's guess, we'll go through the rest of the testimony and the introduction evidence over the course of the next few weeks. And then sometime in late fall, we'll do what they think. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. I've noticed in just the recent period sort of this LSXMA Series spread has tightened a bit, meaning the market seems to think something is going to get resolved. I just have a two part question. Do you think that's true? And if so, what are the options at your disposal to sort of collapse the two? Thanks. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think, the collapse of the two isn't really up to us. I mean if Liberty wants to collapse it, I'm sure they'll make a proposal. The spread widened for quite a while and then – in the course of the last week it tightened it. I think I read a note that Berkshire had bought more of the tracker and there was some feeling that helped to drive the tightening of the spread. Other than that, Jason, we're in the business of running the satellite radio company and maximizing value of SIRI and where it (26:32) may trade is neither here nor there to the management of the company. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I want to reiterate that Jason. I want to reiterate, I paid zero attention to the value of that stock, and you can imagine we pay a lot of attention to the value of SIRI. Liberty will decide what Liberty wants to do and when they decide I'm sure they will let us know. And I think beyond that – but I certainly don't know of any plans they have. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator We'll move next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Good morning, excuse me. Jim, can you talk a little bit of how you're thinking about folding in this new acquisition into the Agero platform from a product perspective and whether this brings some additional OEM relationships into the company that you didn't have before? And then, David, can you give us any help on the Canadian recap in terms of impact to financials, whether you'll consolidate Canada now or they change to the license payment structure or anything on those lines would be helpful? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I'll take the first one, and, Ben, when you heard my comments, you noticed I tread a little bit of water and said that we would get back to you... Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. ...late this year or early next year was, and the reason I did that is right around your question, okay. First and foremost, we will operate Automatic in the foreseeable future as a separate entity, and I don't mean that it will just sit out there on its own. In fact, I've made some realignments on announcing this morning in my organization to put more focus on it. How we consolidate eventually within the CV organization, we're still working on it. And the reason we're still working on that is, as you know, we've been chosen to deploy Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and FCA CV platforms, and all of those platforms are either rolling out right now or roll out over the next four months, and my team on the CV side is totally focused on those rollouts. And so, after we get those rollouts under our belt, a few of us will begin to figure out how we integrate these within the platforms. What I will tell you is I'm very confident they'll integrate well together. I just quite honestly haven't figured out exactly how we want to do it yet. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got you. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Okay. On Canada, we've said previously that we will not be consolidating the results that, while we'll have a 70% economic interest in the recapitalized company, a Canadian board will control the company, and the Canadian shareholders have super voting shares and as it relates to matters like electing the board. So, we don't set the control definition under the accounting rules in order to validate it. So, you'll see the economic effect of Canada come through in a couple of different line items. One will be other revenue that the loyalty rates will go up post-recapitalization. So you'll see that come through other revenue. There will be an adjustment in the dividends we received and, to be honest, I can't remember exactly what that is. So there will be a change that runs through other income. And then to the extent that one of the things that we've talked about, we haven't made a decision yet is that if we called the Canadian bonds they had issued, and replace it perhaps with funding from the U.S. that you could find a boost in interest income. But the way that I think you can think about it is that we incorporated the effect of an anticipated closing of Canada in all of the guidance that we gave so that would be in revenue in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. It's already in our guidance. I will tell you that it's closing a couple of months later than we thought, and so when expressing our confidence in all the guidance this quarter, we feel confident being able to make up for a couple of months of lost economics in Canada. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for the help. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Hey, Ben, the only comment I'd make on Canada is that number one, I think our team has done a really, really good job here, and I'm pleased with the outcome. For me there is all the way the numbers move around, and then there is the basic reason why are we doing it, and that is SiriusXM Canada has run as a separate company. And I know that may be hard for you to believe, but they haven't been able to take advantage of all the investments we're making in all our various platforms. With this transaction, we can move a lot of that out of the way, okay? And I see certainly not maybe as we move through the next two or three quarters, but as we go into 2018 just the opportunity to run that business better because of the economies of scale. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Makes sense. Thank you. Operator Our next question will come from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Great. Thank you. First on some of the investments. You've invested materially in the streaming platform in 360L. How do you measure the return of that investment? Are there certain metrics that you plan to use or is it more broader than that. Are you just thinking about improving the overall listening experience and improving engagement? And then I have a second question. Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think, number one, it's much more the latter than the former however. However, we have real expectations for what we believe we can achieve in terms of how – of metrics of how we expect customers to use it. And so, I would tell you our first intention of 360L is we believe we'll get better engagement with our customers, and better engagement with our subscribers. And we will be able to measure that. And I can tell you in the game we're in, it's all about the engagement, okay. And so, that's the first and foremost reason. Second is, I really do believe and when you see the demos of 360L, it really helps us on the backend of our business to remove friction for customers both to find whatever programming they want, and also to be able to deal with us in a much easier way of whether it's renewing their subscription, converting or anything else they want to do with us and we bundled that all together. I want to caution you here and I've been really consistent here from when I began to share with you in the early days of 360L, this is a march, not a sprint. While in my comments I was very deliberate to say we expect to roll this technology out beginning in the first quarter of 2018, it will take many, many years for this to roll across all the OEM platforms. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Carl, I'll just add that I'm glad that you separated those things out of streaming in 360L. But as you know, we have been charging for our streaming services for eight years and what you – I think you can think about the investments we've made in streaming as having taken profits from that business and reinvested it in improving the streaming app into the platform, resiliency for it that as opposed to making an investment and hoping that it pays off sometime in the future that that's a product that was that not too long ago on 2004, 2005 technology base and needed to be updated. And I think it's – you can tell by ratings that it has come up pretty well. 360L is 100% going to pay off and pay off large. The investments we're marking are substantial, but relative to the scale of the business, very small changes in conversion rates I'm sure (34:54) it will pay off. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Do you want to share with us any expectations about the changes in renewal rates or conversion? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Not yet. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Not at this point. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Yeah. And then, secondly, on some of the exclusive content that you provide subscribers, how was that financed? Is it – do you use other partners? Can you license that after the SIRI airing to other platforms and any synergies with say any other Liberty affiliates like Live Nation? Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. No. I mean, obviously all the talent that we use in our programming, we pay for ourselves. We have not been interested in sub-distributing our content in any other way at this point. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Thank you. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. And I don't think we are. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Okay, thanks. Operator Our next question will come from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Thank you. Just one follow up to what Tom just asked. Is there any timeframe over which you expect the 6VL program (35:57) to have any impact on profit metrics? I know you said it's a march versus a sprint but how long is that march before it starts to hit some of the metrics? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. It's many, many, many quarters, okay. I mean, what I'm very pleased with is our engagement with the OEMs and their excitement about the platform. I've been here 13 years and the one lesson perhaps I've learned the most is we can get as frustrated as we want about changing the OEM cycle, we're not going to change it. And so our deployment is tied in directly to when they deploy their new platforms. I'm very comfortable that we're wired in with them as they deploy at various points. But I will tell you, it takes a long time quite candidly just like it did initially when they introduced satellite radio. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. And sort of a separate issue. You always discussed lot of the things that go into the mix of subscriber additions. Is there any way to separate out what share of those sub adds you're getting from new cars versus used cars at this stage, and how rapidly you expect that mix to shift given peaking SAAR versus the growing base of used cars with installed radios? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I think our new car additions are a little less than half now of total additions. Yeah. And they're going to just tick down bit by bit by bit. In a way, it's... James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. As a percent. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah, as a percent. In a way, it's not the similar to the answer Jim just gave you on the rollout of the 360L. That everything as it relates to automotive distribution pursue sort of like an evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary path. The changes are – they are slow but they are steady, and they are in inexorable in where they're going to go. It's just going that way. And as Jim said in his comments that we're going to see the pen rates on used car sales go from the low-30s to the mid-70s. It's probably going to take a solid decade for that to occur. And as it does, you're going to find subsequent owner additions continuing to rise for that entire period of time. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah. And I couldn't agree more. One point I want make, Jim, is there are a lot things we can debate about whether they are going to happen or not. That mix from mid-30s to mid-70s is just math, and it's absolutely going to happen. There is zero chance it's not going to happen, okay. It's just a question of how long is it going to take. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. And do you think – in that context, do you think used car conversion rates will start to rise as the whole concept of Sirius just becomes that much more prevalent? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I think we've gotten an good idea now that we've been at it for 14 years or 15 years about where are new car conversion and how it behaves, okay. We really understand well model mix; we really understand even within that trend mix, and we now really understand how people who have never used our service before convert versus people who are were just literally changing from one car to another, and how they convert. And so, we've got a really, really good idea. On used cars, we're still really, really new to this game. So, what I say is my feeling. I don't have a ton of analytic data yet to support it. But I believe we will probably rather than used car rates increasing, I just believe we'll continue to see more pressure on those rates. And I'll tell you why? Number one, we're going to a much wider demographic as we expand out; and number two, as you think about it, we're going to get older and older, older vehicles, which are second and third cars in the family. And frankly, one of the challenges our marketing group is looking at and will be developing strategies on is, what is the right way to market to those customers and quite frankly, what might be the right way to price to those customers, as we look at what's the value of those subscribers going forward. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Jim, we think it's more volume at a lower rate and so we'll end up with more additions. And so, when we talk about growth in used car volumes over a decade, we mean growth in conversions. And I mean the only thing we have to go on is new car, right. So, as new car penetration rates went up, conversion rates came down, but at the same level of auto sales, you ended up with more total volume of conversions and that's our expectation at this point for used cars as well. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator We will take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First, on the sub guide for the year, you mentioned the industry still expects about low 17 million SAAR for new cars, can you tell us the assumptions for industry used car sales you're embedding in your guidance, since used cars are such a big part of your gross additions now? And then following up on Jason's question, would you pay a premium to buy back the two-thirds of your stock that Liberty owns as opposed to Liberty making an offer to the minority holders? And then finally, as you mentioned your stock performance in your prepared remarks, as your stock has climbed higher, does that affect your thinking on the mix of your capital return? Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think on the first question, today we don't look at the used car market as a total, and track it as a total industry for one simple reason. Our penetration is, as I said, yeah, I think in the first quarter was about 34%. So, we tend to look at the segments more, meaning, how many SiriusXM enabled vehicles are becoming available, and how many of those are selling. That said, right now, we think used car sales are about consistent also as industry being flat with the year ago period. However, the mix within those is changing a little bit in that the high end of used car sales seems to be under more pressure as new car pricing has gotten a little more competitive here in the last four or five months. And yet the other part of the used car market seems to be growing a little faster. In terms of what's in our guidance that we're using for used car net growth adds, we think we understand that pretty well, and we're confident in how that looks for the rest of the year. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. And, would we consider paying a premium for Liberty's holdings in Sirius, I guess if Liberty was interested in selling their holdings in Sirius that we'd certainly consider it based on the public comments they've made. Greg had said that he anticipates that they will eventually own 100%, so that doesn't sound like it's available for sale. In terms of a higher price and mix of capital returns, I think to go back that as management, I don't think we care who owns the company, I mean we run the company for the shareholders. And so if Liberty wants to be a shareholder, we think that's fantastic; if Berkshire Hathaway wants to be a shareholder, we think that's fantastic. And if it turns out they don't want to be shareholders and somebody else want to be a shareholder, and our job is just to run the company and drive value for whoever our shareholders are. In terms of higher price and mix of capital returns, sure, I guess the value of the stock plays into it, we do take a point of view on value in the buyback program. And while we don't announce target values that we do run grids that are price sensitive, and we buy significantly more stock in periods of weakness, and we buy a little bit less in periods of strength. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah. One other point I'd like to make, and again you have to ask Liberty whatever Liberty wants to do. But I can tell you our relationship with Liberty has never been better. My relationship with Greg Maffei is extremely strong and I tell you, I take personal pride in the fact that our largest shareholder once owned more of our company. That to me is a real endorsement of the strength of our business and our company. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator Our final question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC Hi. It's James Ratcliffe for Vijay. Two, if I could. First of all, it sounds like, it's in the prepared remarks, that the used car conversions holding in around 30%, that seems pretty encouraging. Can we drill down into that a little bit and how much of that is you're getting a larger swath of the transactions and information on that more rapidly and how much is just better execution against the transaction base which you know about? And secondly, regarding, you've seen unlimited data get much more extensive over the course of the last quarter. Do you guys have any sense of how – what take rates for the satellite radio service are for customers who have an unlimited data option on their phone and hence wouldn't effectively be paying for streaming audio versus customers who don't? Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Jay (46:37) I'll start and then David will address the specifics. I want to make a very deliberate point here and that is, and for those of you that are following our company and for investors, I want to be clear how we run this company. While we provide conversion metrics for you, that's not the way we're running the company, and I'll give you a great example. In the used car funnels as you can imagine, we continue to get more sophisticated every quarter on how we find these leads, and occasionally we'll find huge pockets of records, maybe 100,000 vehicles that sold, that we didn't know it sold with SiriusXM in them and now we get those records, and those customers may have already owned those cars for 9 or 12 months, okay. I can tell you that when we go out to try to convert people who have owned the car longer than what would be our normal trial period, they convert at a lower rate, okay. If you were running the business to maximize conversion rate, you would pass on those opportunities. That is not the way we run the business. We run the business to maximize the total additions from those funnels, okay. So, if we see an opportunity where the conversion rate is 12%, and in this particular the used car metrics, our cost to add those subscribers is so attractive, we're going to take that opportunity. And that's why I want you to be careful using those metrics. We provide them and I think they help you be able to look at the top of our funnel and guess the yield from the bottom of our funnel, particularly in the used business they are not an indication of the demand for our service. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, yeah, I couldn't agree more with what Jim said that a lot of the conversion marketing efforts are about the efficiency of the touches. But the used car conversion rate is, it comes from sort of multiple different channels within used cars. And it is one of these things that we do expect it to decline over time. So, I've said many times I've been surprised at how strong it is and how long it stayed at this level. And so, we continue to be really pleased with where it is. In terms of unlimited data plans, James, we see zero impact of that on our business at this point. James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thank you. Hooper Stevens - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Thank you. And, with that, we'll wrap it up. We'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks for your participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

And we will take our first question from Barton Crockett with FBR Capital. Please go ahead. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question. One of the questions I guess was about the confidence that you have in your 1.3 million sub adds for this year, and it's just kind of a basic question, but I mean you added 259,000 self-pay in the first quarter, you multiply by four and you're not hitting that 1.3 million number. So, what is it that you see that drives better sub growth later in the year to give you confidence in hitting your target? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Barton, this is Jim. First of all, I mean, obviously this is a number you can imagine we focus on daily, okay, and when I say we're confident, I want to reiterate we're confident in meeting or beating our guidance of 1.3 million. There are a lot of items that go into this, and I think that the timing of – we're still learning the timing of how used car deactivations are going to hit and when, and as we go through those numbers, and we look at our forecast out for the rest of the year, and what I think is probably certainly a consistent estimate for what we believe SAAR would be, all that points to certainly being able to add 1.3 million. David, do you want to add something? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah. Barton, 259,000 is right on the button for what we expected in the quarter, in our path to 1.3 million. So, for us, we are right on track. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. I mean, seasonally would you (19:11) second and third quarter to typically be much bigger than the first quarter? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think if you look back at the past, they generally have been that the first quarter has always been the low point. So, I don't think there's any year that you would take the first quarter, multiply it by four and get to the end of the year. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. And I think, Barton as you know, we've never given quarterly guidance on subs, but obviously we pay close attention to what the quarters look like, and look, I think that's all I can add there. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay, all right. And then to your acquisition, I know you guys are not giving a value for this, but I assume that means that it skews towards the immaterial side in terms of what you spent. But I was wondering if you could talk about maybe what the impact is on your financial statements from their business such as it is, that somebody will kind of notice or not and a little bit more detail on how meaningful you think it could become over time? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think nothing about the acquisition of Automatic would cause us to change our guidance for the year for EBITDA or revenue. What we spent out will be in the 10-Q, it's a little over $100 million to acquire it. And look, as we get in there and in future calls, I think you can expect to hear us talk more about it. But as it relates to revenue and EBITDA, it wouldn't cause us to change those measures at this point. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. Great, I'll leave it there. Thank you very much. Operator And our next question will come from Amy Yong with Macquarie Securities. Please go ahead. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Thanks. Two quick questions. So, first just following upon Automatic Labs, can you give us a sense of what this actually brings to the consumer offering, it looks like it is a consumer facing product, just wondering how that actually gets incorporated into the SiriusXM product itself? And then secondly, can you update us on CRB and how we should be thinking about this particular round of hearings versus the last round? Thank you. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I'll take the first and David will take the second. What appeals to me about Automatic is, two things. One, they have a very interesting vehicle analytics data platform, that frankly we think has lacked significant investment and it's something that combined with our very large vehicle database can be leveraged into a very valuable asset, and we'll get on with those plans over the next several months. And so I would say that's less of a consumer facing advantage. It ultimately should, if it works out, generate revenue in some consumer facing way. Second though, they do have an adapter that they developed that we found to be quite impressive. They're already on their third generation of technology on that adapter and to amplify that a little bit that adapter at least in my mind would give us the capability to reach out to a mammoth number of cars, 150 million of the 250 million active cars in the U.S. and provide connectivity in a way that would provide connected vehicle services to those cars. We have a lot of work to do to understand what the right path to that option might be and what the speed towards that option would be, but that's what appealed to me about Automatic. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Amy, I'd just add, I think that you can think of it as having applicability in various industry verticals, some of which are – there are things that OEMs can benefit from these products. There are things that dealers can benefit from the insurance industry. It has a very strong interest in this product. There may be information that we can get back out of it depending on the car and what's happening with radio modules. And there may be other industry applications as well on top of the consumer offering. So, we're excited about what we can do with this. On the CRB side, so I am obviously biased on this one, right. So, I've been at three or four of these proceedings over the years providing testimony, but I honestly don't believe that SoundExchange has put on much of a case. And there are only three opinions that matter and those are the judges. And so what I think actually – I don't think you should necessarily take all that much from it, but there is a very strong record hearing prior proceedings about what the judges have thought about the upper bound of a reasonable range of rate. So I think that SoundExchange has come back in and for effectively the third time, it has presented the case, it says that we think the rate ought to be over 20%. And I just don't think when you look at their case, they've actually presented any evidence that would suggest that there is any difference here from the past. On the other hand, I think that there is a very strong link in the case that we put on that says, if you look at what the judges decided in the webcaster proceeding and that you (24:55) satellite radio that there is a very good case for rates going down based on decisions the judges have made about the value of sound recordings in other areas. So, what they'll decide, anybody's guess, we'll go through the rest of the testimony and the introduction evidence over the course of the next few weeks. And then sometime in late fall, we'll do what they think. Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital ( USA ), Inc. Great. Thank you. Operator Our next question will come from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Yeah. I've noticed in just the recent period sort of this LSXMA Series spread has tightened a bit, meaning the market seems to think something is going to get resolved. I just have a two part question. Do you think that's true? And if so, what are the options at your disposal to sort of collapse the two? Thanks. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think, the collapse of the two isn't really up to us. I mean if Liberty wants to collapse it, I'm sure they'll make a proposal. The spread widened for quite a while and then – in the course of the last week it tightened it. I think I read a note that Berkshire had bought more of the tracker and there was some feeling that helped to drive the tightening of the spread. Other than that, Jason, we're in the business of running the satellite radio company and maximizing value of SIRI and where it (26:32) may trade is neither here nor there to the management of the company. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I want to reiterate that Jason. I want to reiterate, I paid zero attention to the value of that stock, and you can imagine we pay a lot of attention to the value of SIRI. Liberty will decide what Liberty wants to do and when they decide I'm sure they will let us know. And I think beyond that – but I certainly don't know of any plans they have. Jason B. Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator We'll move next to Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks. Good morning, excuse me. Jim, can you talk a little bit of how you're thinking about folding in this new acquisition into the Agero platform from a product perspective and whether this brings some additional OEM relationships into the company that you didn't have before? And then, David, can you give us any help on the Canadian recap in terms of impact to financials, whether you'll consolidate Canada now or they change to the license payment structure or anything on those lines would be helpful? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I'll take the first one, and, Ben, when you heard my comments, you noticed I tread a little bit of water and said that we would get back to you... Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Yeah. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. ...late this year or early next year was, and the reason I did that is right around your question, okay. First and foremost, we will operate Automatic in the foreseeable future as a separate entity, and I don't mean that it will just sit out there on its own. In fact, I've made some realignments on announcing this morning in my organization to put more focus on it. How we consolidate eventually within the CV organization, we're still working on it. And the reason we're still working on that is, as you know, we've been chosen to deploy Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and FCA CV platforms, and all of those platforms are either rolling out right now or roll out over the next four months, and my team on the CV side is totally focused on those rollouts. And so, after we get those rollouts under our belt, a few of us will begin to figure out how we integrate these within the platforms. What I will tell you is I'm very confident they'll integrate well together. I just quite honestly haven't figured out exactly how we want to do it yet. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Got you. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Okay. On Canada, we've said previously that we will not be consolidating the results that, while we'll have a 70% economic interest in the recapitalized company, a Canadian board will control the company, and the Canadian shareholders have super voting shares and as it relates to matters like electing the board. So, we don't set the control definition under the accounting rules in order to validate it. So, you'll see the economic effect of Canada come through in a couple of different line items. One will be other revenue that the loyalty rates will go up post-recapitalization. So you'll see that come through other revenue. There will be an adjustment in the dividends we received and, to be honest, I can't remember exactly what that is. So there will be a change that runs through other income. And then to the extent that one of the things that we've talked about, we haven't made a decision yet is that if we called the Canadian bonds they had issued, and replace it perhaps with funding from the U.S. that you could find a boost in interest income. But the way that I think you can think about it is that we incorporated the effect of an anticipated closing of Canada in all of the guidance that we gave so that would be in revenue in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. It's already in our guidance. I will tell you that it's closing a couple of months later than we thought, and so when expressing our confidence in all the guidance this quarter, we feel confident being able to make up for a couple of months of lost economics in Canada. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for the help. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Hey, Ben, the only comment I'd make on Canada is that number one, I think our team has done a really, really good job here, and I'm pleased with the outcome. For me there is all the way the numbers move around, and then there is the basic reason why are we doing it, and that is SiriusXM Canada has run as a separate company. And I know that may be hard for you to believe, but they haven't been able to take advantage of all the investments we're making in all our various platforms. With this transaction, we can move a lot of that out of the way, okay? And I see certainly not maybe as we move through the next two or three quarters, but as we go into 2018 just the opportunity to run that business better because of the economies of scale. Benjamin Daniel Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Makes sense. Thank you. Operator Our next question will come from Tom Eagan with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Great. Thank you. First on some of the investments. You've invested materially in the streaming platform in 360L. How do you measure the return of that investment? Are there certain metrics that you plan to use or is it more broader than that. Are you just thinking about improving the overall listening experience and improving engagement? And then I have a second question. Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think, number one, it's much more the latter than the former however. However, we have real expectations for what we believe we can achieve in terms of how – of metrics of how we expect customers to use it. And so, I would tell you our first intention of 360L is we believe we'll get better engagement with our customers, and better engagement with our subscribers. And we will be able to measure that. And I can tell you in the game we're in, it's all about the engagement, okay. And so, that's the first and foremost reason. Second is, I really do believe and when you see the demos of 360L, it really helps us on the backend of our business to remove friction for customers both to find whatever programming they want, and also to be able to deal with us in a much easier way of whether it's renewing their subscription, converting or anything else they want to do with us and we bundled that all together. I want to caution you here and I've been really consistent here from when I began to share with you in the early days of 360L, this is a march, not a sprint. While in my comments I was very deliberate to say we expect to roll this technology out beginning in the first quarter of 2018, it will take many, many years for this to roll across all the OEM platforms. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Carl, I'll just add that I'm glad that you separated those things out of streaming in 360L. But as you know, we have been charging for our streaming services for eight years and what you – I think you can think about the investments we've made in streaming as having taken profits from that business and reinvested it in improving the streaming app into the platform, resiliency for it that as opposed to making an investment and hoping that it pays off sometime in the future that that's a product that was that not too long ago on 2004, 2005 technology base and needed to be updated. And I think it's – you can tell by ratings that it has come up pretty well. 360L is 100% going to pay off and pay off large. The investments we're marking are substantial, but relative to the scale of the business, very small changes in conversion rates I'm sure (34:54) it will pay off. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Do you want to share with us any expectations about the changes in renewal rates or conversion? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Not yet. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Not at this point. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Yeah. And then, secondly, on some of the exclusive content that you provide subscribers, how was that financed? Is it – do you use other partners? Can you license that after the SIRI airing to other platforms and any synergies with say any other Liberty affiliates like Live Nation? Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. No. I mean, obviously all the talent that we use in our programming, we pay for ourselves. We have not been interested in sub-distributing our content in any other way at this point. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Thank you. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. And I don't think we are. Thomas William Eagan - Telsey Advisory Group Okay, thanks. Operator Our next question will come from Jim Goss with Barrington Research. Please go ahead. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Thank you. Just one follow up to what Tom just asked. Is there any timeframe over which you expect the 6VL program (35:57) to have any impact on profit metrics? I know you said it's a march versus a sprint but how long is that march before it starts to hit some of the metrics? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. It's many, many, many quarters, okay. I mean, what I'm very pleased with is our engagement with the OEMs and their excitement about the platform. I've been here 13 years and the one lesson perhaps I've learned the most is we can get as frustrated as we want about changing the OEM cycle, we're not going to change it. And so our deployment is tied in directly to when they deploy their new platforms. I'm very comfortable that we're wired in with them as they deploy at various points. But I will tell you, it takes a long time quite candidly just like it did initially when they introduced satellite radio. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. And sort of a separate issue. You always discussed lot of the things that go into the mix of subscriber additions. Is there any way to separate out what share of those sub adds you're getting from new cars versus used cars at this stage, and how rapidly you expect that mix to shift given peaking SAAR versus the growing base of used cars with installed radios? David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I think our new car additions are a little less than half now of total additions. Yeah. And they're going to just tick down bit by bit by bit. In a way, it's... James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. As a percent. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah, as a percent. In a way, it's not the similar to the answer Jim just gave you on the rollout of the 360L. That everything as it relates to automotive distribution pursue sort of like an evolutionary as opposed to revolutionary path. The changes are – they are slow but they are steady, and they are in inexorable in where they're going to go. It's just going that way. And as Jim said in his comments that we're going to see the pen rates on used car sales go from the low-30s to the mid-70s. It's probably going to take a solid decade for that to occur. And as it does, you're going to find subsequent owner additions continuing to rise for that entire period of time. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah. And I couldn't agree more. One point I want make, Jim, is there are a lot things we can debate about whether they are going to happen or not. That mix from mid-30s to mid-70s is just math, and it's absolutely going to happen. There is zero chance it's not going to happen, okay. It's just a question of how long is it going to take. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. And do you think – in that context, do you think used car conversion rates will start to rise as the whole concept of Sirius just becomes that much more prevalent? James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. I think we've gotten an good idea now that we've been at it for 14 years or 15 years about where are new car conversion and how it behaves, okay. We really understand well model mix; we really understand even within that trend mix, and we now really understand how people who have never used our service before convert versus people who are were just literally changing from one car to another, and how they convert. And so, we've got a really, really good idea. On used cars, we're still really, really new to this game. So, what I say is my feeling. I don't have a ton of analytic data yet to support it. But I believe we will probably rather than used car rates increasing, I just believe we'll continue to see more pressure on those rates. And I'll tell you why? Number one, we're going to a much wider demographic as we expand out; and number two, as you think about it, we're going to get older and older, older vehicles, which are second and third cars in the family. And frankly, one of the challenges our marketing group is looking at and will be developing strategies on is, what is the right way to market to those customers and quite frankly, what might be the right way to price to those customers, as we look at what's the value of those subscribers going forward. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Jim, we think it's more volume at a lower rate and so we'll end up with more additions. And so, when we talk about growth in used car volumes over a decade, we mean growth in conversions. And I mean the only thing we have to go on is new car, right. So, as new car penetration rates went up, conversion rates came down, but at the same level of auto sales, you ended up with more total volume of conversions and that's our expectation at this point for used cars as well. James Charles Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc. Okay. Thanks so much. Operator We will take our next question from Brandon Ross with BTIG. Please go ahead. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC Hi, thanks for taking the questions. First, on the sub guide for the year, you mentioned the industry still expects about low 17 million SAAR for new cars, can you tell us the assumptions for industry used car sales you're embedding in your guidance, since used cars are such a big part of your gross additions now? And then following up on Jason's question, would you pay a premium to buy back the two-thirds of your stock that Liberty owns as opposed to Liberty making an offer to the minority holders? And then finally, as you mentioned your stock performance in your prepared remarks, as your stock has climbed higher, does that affect your thinking on the mix of your capital return? Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, I think on the first question, today we don't look at the used car market as a total, and track it as a total industry for one simple reason. Our penetration is, as I said, yeah, I think in the first quarter was about 34%. So, we tend to look at the segments more, meaning, how many SiriusXM enabled vehicles are becoming available, and how many of those are selling. That said, right now, we think used car sales are about consistent also as industry being flat with the year ago period. However, the mix within those is changing a little bit in that the high end of used car sales seems to be under more pressure as new car pricing has gotten a little more competitive here in the last four or five months. And yet the other part of the used car market seems to be growing a little faster. In terms of what's in our guidance that we're using for used car net growth adds, we think we understand that pretty well, and we're confident in how that looks for the rest of the year. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. And, would we consider paying a premium for Liberty's holdings in Sirius, I guess if Liberty was interested in selling their holdings in Sirius that we'd certainly consider it based on the public comments they've made. Greg had said that he anticipates that they will eventually own 100%, so that doesn't sound like it's available for sale. In terms of a higher price and mix of capital returns, I think to go back that as management, I don't think we care who owns the company, I mean we run the company for the shareholders. And so if Liberty wants to be a shareholder, we think that's fantastic; if Berkshire Hathaway wants to be a shareholder, we think that's fantastic. And if it turns out they don't want to be shareholders and somebody else want to be a shareholder, and our job is just to run the company and drive value for whoever our shareholders are. In terms of higher price and mix of capital returns, sure, I guess the value of the stock plays into it, we do take a point of view on value in the buyback program. And while we don't announce target values that we do run grids that are price sensitive, and we buy significantly more stock in periods of weakness, and we buy a little bit less in periods of strength. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Yeah. One other point I'd like to make, and again you have to ask Liberty whatever Liberty wants to do. But I can tell you our relationship with Liberty has never been better. My relationship with Greg Maffei is extremely strong and I tell you, I take personal pride in the fact that our largest shareholder once owned more of our company. That to me is a real endorsement of the strength of our business and our company. Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator Our final question will come from Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC Hi. It's James Ratcliffe for Vijay. Two, if I could. First of all, it sounds like, it's in the prepared remarks, that the used car conversions holding in around 30%, that seems pretty encouraging. Can we drill down into that a little bit and how much of that is you're getting a larger swath of the transactions and information on that more rapidly and how much is just better execution against the transaction base which you know about? And secondly, regarding, you've seen unlimited data get much more extensive over the course of the last quarter. Do you guys have any sense of how – what take rates for the satellite radio service are for customers who have an unlimited data option on their phone and hence wouldn't effectively be paying for streaming audio versus customers who don't? Thanks. James E. Meyer - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, Jay (46:37) I'll start and then David will address the specifics. I want to make a very deliberate point here and that is, and for those of you that are following our company and for investors, I want to be clear how we run this company. While we provide conversion metrics for you, that's not the way we're running the company, and I'll give you a great example. In the used car funnels as you can imagine, we continue to get more sophisticated every quarter on how we find these leads, and occasionally we'll find huge pockets of records, maybe 100,000 vehicles that sold, that we didn't know it sold with SiriusXM in them and now we get those records, and those customers may have already owned those cars for 9 or 12 months, okay. I can tell you that when we go out to try to convert people who have owned the car longer than what would be our normal trial period, they convert at a lower rate, okay. If you were running the business to maximize conversion rate, you would pass on those opportunities. That is not the way we run the business. We run the business to maximize the total additions from those funnels, okay. So, if we see an opportunity where the conversion rate is 12%, and in this particular the used car metrics, our cost to add those subscribers is so attractive, we're going to take that opportunity. And that's why I want you to be careful using those metrics. We provide them and I think they help you be able to look at the top of our funnel and guess the yield from the bottom of our funnel, particularly in the used business they are not an indication of the demand for our service. David J. Frear - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. So, yeah, I couldn't agree more with what Jim said that a lot of the conversion marketing efforts are about the efficiency of the touches. But the used car conversion rate is, it comes from sort of multiple different channels within used cars. And it is one of these things that we do expect it to decline over time. So, I've said many times I've been surprised at how strong it is and how long it stayed at this level. And so, we continue to be really pleased with where it is. In terms of unlimited data plans, James, we see zero impact of that on our business at this point. James Ratcliffe - Evercore Group LLC Great. Thank you. Hooper Stevens - Sirius XM Holdings, Inc. Thank you. And, with that, we'll wrap it up. We'll speak to you next quarter. Thanks for your participation. Copyright policy:  All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NASDAQ: SIRI ) 45th Annual J.P. Morgan Global Technology, Media and Telecom Conference Call May 23, 2017 11:20 AM ET Executives James Meyer - Chief Executive Officer Analysts Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co., Philip Cusick Hi. We’re going to get started guys. My name is Phil Cusick. I cover the Telecom and Cable space here at JPMorgan. I want to welcome Jim Meyer, who is the CEO of SiriusXM. Jim is the relatively recently appointed CEO, but he was with the Company for a long time as COO. Thank you for joining us. James Meyer Thank you. Philip Cusick Do you want to just give us a few minutes on sort of priorities that the Company is working on right now? What are the big issues that you're focused on? James Meyer I think the first issue that we pay a lot of close attention to is our content and obviously it's the reason people pay us and so I think we constantly push ourselves to be improving the bundle of content that we offer constantly. A good example is I think last Wednesday or Thursday, we introduced a exclusive Beatles Channel, which for those in a listeners Channel 18, it’s going to be really, really – it's a very, very good channel. It has been developed fully with the management, the Beatles’ management to develop and it’s just a good example of how we are constantly pushing ourselves. Second is I worry a lot about our position in the car and in particularly our penetration rate in the new car, which is at an all time high in the upper 70s and I really worry about that for two reasons. One, it feeds our first funnel of where new subscriber come from. And second its oxymoron, but I lecture our guys all the timeline, it can't be a used car until it's been a new car and when you think about how big the used car business is in the United States and our rapidly rising penetration rate in that business is giving us a tremendous second funnel to drive growth. And so we worry a lot about those. And the final area, I tell you I worry a lot, a lot, a lot about as our churn. And we spend a lot of time talking about. I meet with our teams almost every week in terms of why customers are leaving us and how we can do a better job keeping them. Philip Cusick Well, let's start on the first one. The new car penetration in the upper 70s, given the sort of skew of sales that are out there for new cars, is that about as high as you can get or as you look down the contract path, can you see even a higher mix there? James Meyer So believe it or not, there are still a lot of carmakers who kind of still sell that lead model with no floor mats and so there is – particularly some of the big U.S. guys, they want an entry level of vehicles that don’t have any features in them and so there is no use trying to push into those. Second, if you get into that $17 million kind of SAAR, there is a chuck of those, I’ll give you an example work events that a plumping company will buy eight of or 10 of, those were never going to get a suppression from, and so we kind – I really see where it is today about where it will stay. If we see an opportunity to increase it, we will and working with the automakers, but we're not pushing it as far as we used to because where it is right now. So for instance in the luxury brands, we are 100% and there's a really good return on our economics there. Philip Cusick And as the electronics in the cars improve over the next few years, talk about where you're going from today sort of standard satellite radio 2 both 360L and connected car, what are the things that are happening there? James Meyer So one of the things I get to do is, we spent a lot of time with the auto industry and a lot of time with various levels of audio executives. I can tell you for instance, there are connected car work, I will tell you for instance with one large Asian OEM, we're already almost signing off the 2022 model year with them, okay, so were that far out. So we have a really good view of what's going on in terms of where the trends are aware, this particular part of technology is going in cars. We don't weigh in on hybrids and electrical and all that stuff. And the one thing I can tell you and I've said it many times, in 2020 the vast majority of new cars built will have an embedded modem in them. And they will have an embedded modem in them really having nothing to do with entertainment. They will have an embedded modem in them for all the things the carmaker wants to do with frankly the number one on the list is over the year software upgrades to the vehicle, which will have a profound impact on their warranty costs, but that modem will also allow an extensive change in the entertainment experience in the vehicle. We've developed a piece of software, which had its sense is a new interface for the vehicle called 360L and the concept in 360L, I’ll give you an example, our headquarters at 49 Street and 6 Avenue, New York. If you were sitting out in front of our building, listening to satellite radio and you say, I really like satellite radio. You're not even getting from a satellite. You're getting it from a terrestrial repeater over a couple blocks and you don't care. All you care is I'm listening to the Highway. In the world going forward, 360L will allow that entertainment experience to shift between our private satellite network, our private terrestrial network and the public wireless networks to significantly enhance both the front-end of our user experience as well as our back-end of our user experience. And many people asking aren’t you really afraid of the connected car? No, I'm not. I mean I actually believe the connected car is really good for our business because frankly that connectivity is going to – we don't give up any of the advantages we have with our very powerful one to many network and we get all of those things that we're lacking in that network like return path data, a direct link to the customer to be able to really simplify our CRM process and our customer process and the opportunity to sell the customer new services. Philip Cusick So let's talk about the path of connected car, can you dig a little deeper into the new model mix of connected car in the next few years? And then also on the use side, you've introduced some products to start to connect some of the used cars out there, how do you see that ecosystem going? James Meyer Well, so I think the connected car business, I think I've been CEO a little over four years. I've been at Sirius almost 13 years and the one lesson I can't ever seem to learn is how slow the OEM cycle go, okay, even when I adjust it to what I think is the right speed, it generally goes lower than what we predict. And a great example of that is if you went back 10 years ago, our incorporation rate of satellite radio in cars was mid-teens or high-teens and now it's high-70s, right. That isn't just driven by the popularity. The product it takes that long to work through the development cycles. The connected vehicle is coming. It's coming in a big way. I think all of you’ve seen with Toyota, Nissan, Fiat Chrysler, and Honda, all of those will be introducing our connected vehicle platform this year. As we speak right now, they’re actually coming in the 2018 model year and we will begin rolling out and then you'll see those platforms rollout across their vehicle lines over the next three to five years. So we're really excited about building a different revenue source there than our current entertainment business. But also we're really excited about the capability that that's going to give us in vehicles to be able to enhance our existing service. Philip Cusick So how you think about those four automakers, the ones that they're launching in 2018, what's the mix of connected versus unconnected in those new model year where you're involved…? James Meyer Most of the OEMs don't like us to speak publicly about their plans. But I can tell you for most of them they're rather modest to where they start, but I can also tell you their plans are to continue ramping up that upgrade over the next three to five years. Philip Cusick If an automaker is launching a new platform 2018 model year is all the vehicles of that line going to be connected or is it sort of a high-end product within that…? James Meyer It is the way the automakers generally do it is they never put all their line at risk at once. And so they generally – they're divided into four increments or five increments where there's new models every year, but each time and so the either only 20% or 25% of the vehicles that convert over of the models. Let’s say sometimes the volume is really, really heavy like the F-150, the number one selling vehicle, when it changes it skews a lot and so at any given time there's usually about 20% of the volume that's being impact. Philip Cusick I'm thinking within that new model car, not – just the F-150 for example with all of the cars within that be connected or would there be sort of a good, better, best as well? James Meyer Well, we're not in the F-150, but right now actually – for some of them it’s actually starting at a lower trim level than you might imagine. It just happened to be the radio platform that was changing in the 2018 model year. It hasn't necessarily been about where it sits in the line and more about where they're changing the platforms over and they can fit this in as they get there. Philip Cusick And what's the opportunity for going back to connecting older cars? You've got a product that can do this… James Meyer Well, it's a great question. Most of you know we made an acquisition about three weeks ago. We announced the acquisition of the Company called Automatic Labs in San Francisco. And the reasons that interest me very much is twofold. One they have a really interesting what I'll call data clearinghouse platform that's geared to the vehicles right and if you want to be – if you want to keep growing in this business, one thing I'm sure of this is going to be a massive amount of data going back and forth between connected vehicles and people who might be interested in that. And so we see a chance to continue to build that platform and then perhaps be able to work with our OEM partners to couple into that platform. As importantly they also have an adapter that allows you to plug in the vehicles. My guess is, there is between 120 million and 150 million of the used cars that are out there right now, do not have any connectivity that this would allow you to go backwards to connect those vehicles, and excites us looking at that opportunity. What we do with it and how we roll it out, we're not ready to say here, but we certainly are looking at the connected vehicle business going forward and going backwards. Philip Cusick And how does that product compare to the one that Verizon has a product, T-Mobile as a product to connect vehicles as well? James Meyer We think it'll be better, but we’ll see and we learn an awful lot about OnStar and what OnStar does and but I want to be clear we have not publicly said what our strategy will be in that space yet, we're still working on. Philip Cusick And as you mentioned that's sort of a new revenue stream, new business model, how does that affect the legacy SiriusXM business? James Meyer Not at all. Philip Cusick Not at all. James Meyer Not at all. Philip Cusick Okay. So let's switch over to 360L, as you start to get those vehicles connected, how do you treat the customer differently? How can you service them better? James Meyer So 360L will begin rolling out in the first half of next year. I'll caution you, it's like a lot of things in the auto industry and I've been very clear on my earnings call, it's a March, not a run and certainly not a sprint. It will go very slowly, very clearly across multiple vehicle manufacturers and multiple vehicle lines, it will take several, several years to build. But it will greatly simplify our relationship with the customer. We've demoed it to a lot of people. There is I think 40 or 50 vehicles out now in operation around the country where we're testing it and using it. But for instance it allows you one touch renewal. You just literally can push a button on the dashboard and renew your subscription, upgrade your subscription, change whatever you want about your subscription with having zero conversation with us. On the other side of it is it allows us to know that you love our country channels particularly the Highway. We noticed you never do listen to our Garth Brooks Channel and so the next communication we send you ought to be about now we have Garth Brooks, we have Kenny Chesney and we have this and why don't you try listening to it or you tell us you're a big God forgive, New England Patriots fan and we know there's a show or a game or whatever and we can immediately alert you them that those things are on. We can't do that in our one way network today, 360L will allow us to really change that experience. Philip Cusick As you think about that March, not the total penetration, but of new cars, do you expect that 360L will eventually have the penetration of new cars that SiriusXM does today? James Meyer I do. What I can and as I told you I admitted my – I confessed my biggest weakness, it will be slower than I think it will be. But what I can tell you is it's been – every OEM we've showed it to has loved it. It's just a matter of where it fits in their development cycles. What’s important by the way, it doesn't add any costs to the vehicle. It obviously is development costs for both us and each OEM as we roll it out, but it needs to go as they rollout their platforms to fit in and so we're busily working on those plans and my guess we will be for several years to come. Philip Cusick Leveraging some level of touch screen that's already there? James Meyer And voice. Philip Cusick And voice, no incremental OpEx, okay. And how does it change how you sort of think about your content? Do you expect to find out that some things are more popular and less than others? James Meyer Well first and foremost I think the biggest thing is it completely takes away any capacity constraints we have. So if today we want to do three additional music channels, we're almost at capacity in our satellite capacity and so we have to generally – when we put other programming up we generally try to either look for programming that's not as popular we can take down. I hate doing that, okay. There's always somebody who loves the channel we take down…. Philip Cusick You mentioned the 40s channel? James Meyer Yes, we took the 40s channel down and I thought if you're listening to 40s channel maybe you should need to be driving, but that ended up not being correct, trust me I got more. By the way I got more e-mail campaigns and online campaigns by people of the 40s channel you can imagine. With this connectivity coming, we can have as many channels as we want. We can also change our service. I'll give you an example. We have lots of talk content today, it's great. We have a great channel called Doctor Radio and how many of you listen to it? But it's linear. When you want to hear the chart the channel on men's prostate health, it needs to be on and you happen to be – need to be in the car when it's on. In the 360L, where we're going to be able to push a button and we can give it to you on demand, it's going to change our entertainment experience a lot. More importantly that we’re also going to be able to customize that entertainment experience to you based on what you tell us your preferences are. I will tell you one thing though, I talked to a lot of young people and they're always telling me they want to go this way and that way and all that stuff. Most of our subscribers I talk to asked me one thing. Hey, can you make it even easier for me to use. And so at it’s heart, the one thing that I've just driven through our organization 360L has to be simple, simple, simple to use and that's really the starting premise of it. Philip Cusick That's interesting. Let's open it up to the audience. If you have a question there's a mic that can come around, please raise your hand and I'd be happy to calling you. While we wait to see if anybody has a question, let me ask you about churn. You mentioned that as one of the big places that you focus. What are the things a) that are going well and improving over the last year and b) what do you worry about on the churn side? James Meyer So our number one, two, three and four and five reason for why people churn is pretty simple. I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, I don't want to pay, okay. So of course there is – you took a channel off I don't like, but it's way over here and our primary competition without question is free and by the way everybody gets all excited about all of the streaming stuff, our primary competition I will tell you is terrestrial radio today without question. And when I talk to people who have left us and want to understand why they left us. Most of them either say, I don't want to pay or frankly you never gave me enough reason for me to pay. And when I say where would you go? They almost all went back to their local AM and FM station, okay. And they complain about it whether on the phone, they don't really like it, but we haven't given them a good enough reason. We've given 32 million people a good enough reason to pay us, okay. And so our churn has been really, really steady between 1.8% and 2% a month. That number is particularly impressive, ladies and gentlemen it includes turnover of the vehicle. So if you’re a subscriber and you bought a new car, okay, in our model you’re a subscriber, you're a churner, you're a trailer, and then you’re subscriber again, right because you change vehicles and we can't necessarily match you up as well as we would like to in that system. So a big part of our churn has sold my car, okay. That's going to get bigger and bigger and bigger over time and we’re – our team is really, really focused and what we're getting so much more sophisticated is to ask ourselves two questions every time that happens. Number one where did you go when you sold your vehicle? And in fact did we find you – almost overwhelming that you bought another car and where we able to simply transition you from that car to this car and keep our subscription relationship with you. That's the first question we ask ourselves. And what's important today, we also say what happened to that car you sold? Where did it go? Who bought it and how do we establish a relationship with them? And so this natural turnover while I don't worry about it. We can't stop it. I think actually is going to give us a much bigger opportunity and getting second and third owners. When you go to the fundamentals of our business where you measure the impact potentially of competition and there I mean voluntary and non-voluntary churn, frankly we're operating right now as good levels that I've seen in 13 years and so I'm pretty pleased with it. Philip Cusick Let's go to the question. Question-and-Answer Session Q - Unidentified Analyst Hi. James Meyer Hi. Unidentified Analyst You and David have been skeptical about streaming services in the past, has anything changed in that respect? James Meyer Well, I don't know that I've been skeptical about streaming. I want to be clear, I love streaming as a technology. It's one of the arguments, I work for Mel Karmazin for eight years, but I love working for Mel. But Mel saw streaming as a competitor. I see streaming as a technology and the rules vote it, right. I mean there's not a human in the world don’t have one of these, okay. And so we shouldn't care how customers listen. We should only care that they listen and pay us. And so I don't care, which device they listen to. I only care that they listen. The streaming businesses today I think have challenged economics and what we keep asking ourselves is, if we were to get involved in one of those businesses, how can we change that equation perhaps in a way that would be beneficial for our shareholders? That's a tough question. I love spotify. I read about them all the time. I use their product all the time. At some point, they're going to have to make money. And I'm not sure how easy that's really going to be, right. And so those business models challenge us. The other thing we're really careful, and I want to be clear here and maybe we're not getting it right, but we think we really are seeing it crystal clear. We don't want to be in the music distribution business. Music has been distributed for 50 years. There are records and then eight tracks and then cassettes and then CDs and then downloads, and now downloads being replaced perhaps by $10 a month, let’s call it a lease business. Those are different than the business we’re in. We’re in the radio business. We’re not in the music distribution business. We want to be careful with jumping over that void. Now I will tell you one thing. We're spending a lot of money on streaming. We're spending a lot of money – we have a big team working on significantly improving our apps and significantly improving the services that are available on those apps. And the day our customers say to us, hey Jim, I know you drew this line between these $10 services and something else. I expect to get that from you. We’ll have to give it to them. We’ll go develop that service and provide it to them. Unidentified Analyst When you stream your service, you confirm to the CRB rates that are relevant to your satellite service or do the CRB rates that are set by the SoundExchange for webcasting? James Meyer Our streaming product complies with the SoundExchange for webcast. Unidentified Analyst With some of the deals that have been done recently for webcasting at very high rates, does that have any relationship to your upcoming CRB discussions? James Meyer Not that we see at all, no. Unidentified Analyst Okay, thanks. Philip Cusick There was one here. Unidentified Analyst While you walkover, let's follow-up on the advertising model. Those streaming services are all driven by advertising, but your advertising business has been ramping up as well. What is the ad load on your product today and how are you selling it and how do you expect it to grow? James Meyer Well, I mean we don't have any ads on our music channels and at least as long as I’m in-charge we never well, okay. Our customers value commercial free in music and we need to protect that value equation with customers everywhere we can. On our talk channels, we do sell ads and frankly it's necessary because there are natural breaks in talk channels. I'll give example Howard Stern, he needs to take a break every so often and we run those ads when he's on break. Our ad business today is I think in the $140 million range, our total revenues in the $5.3 billion range. So it's 2% of our revenue growing to 3%. I’d love to grow it one day to 5% of our revenue. I don't know whether we'll be able to do that or not, okay. And so it's funny I just spoke to our whole ad sales force last week until now great, everything is and they are, they're growing double-digit and I love it. But our primary way to make money is subscriptions and our primary way to make money going forward will be subscriptions. Philip Cusick Okay, the question for you. Unidentified Analyst Yes, I was just curious your thoughts on trends around vehicle sharing, autonomous vehicles, vehicle ownership and how that's going to impact the business going forward? James Meyer Yes. I think it's going to change probably a little slower than some of you might think. But I certainly believe it could have an impact on how many cars there are in the U.S. or the world one day. Frankly we only care about North America. Our business is very North American centric both U.S. and Canada. So that's really all we worry about. There is the beginning of macro trends, which you just identified, which is more young people and older people coming back from the suburbs into the cities, more of them saying right, sharing works for me. On the flipside, I'll tell you I got three kids, when everyone of them graduate from college, what would you like they all want a car, right. And so I'm kind of waiting to see that balance. We certainly don't see it having a meaningful impact in the next three to five years and we base that on both our own knowledge as well as the various – I know there's any given time 20 different forecasts out there from experts and banks and what's going to happen to the SAAR, inevitably it has to have some impact on it. Unidentified Analyst Can you talk about your penetration in the home and your strategy there and then your overall kind of medium-term growth rate, how you grow revenue? James Meyer So we dominate in car listening today and when someone subscribes our service, I can tell you they just mostly listen to SiriusXM and frankly they go back mostly for local weather, local sports, local news is why they go back to their terrestrial station. This is one of the things I'm so excited about connectivity for. I don't know how many of you owned our – I’ll probably get killed for them, but how many of you owned our products like five years ago, if you wanted to listen to our product from the satellite you had to buy a boombox and put a little antenna. I mean we made some really clever products, but let's face it, that's not what you've got to be a really passionate fan to do that. Now you can just take this device or your tablet and work it right through your home entertainment system. So and we announced in our earnings call last quarter, a huge increase in the amount of aftermarket devices were now available on, things like Sony Play Station almost every Smart TV and I can tell you there is more to come in the next 30 days in a big way. And so our goal is to get you to listen more everywhere and we're going to work a lot harder on that and think about it. It's almost like the same as 360L, if we can get you to listen more at home through a connected environment, we get some of those same benefits I talk to you about that we want to go in the car. If we know you listen to the highway at home, it's a pretty good bass, you listen to the highway in the car, which gives us a little bit more knowledge about you to help us better experience what we offer to you to try to make you more sticky and a better listener. So I think you will see more and more focus for us improving our streaming products and more and more focus on us trying to lift up the amount in-home listenership we get as well, without losing our position in the car. When I say in the car, I mean when you work out in the car, where those might be. I can't hear you ma'am sorry. Growth, so number one, I will tell you I expect us to have subscriber growth as far as I can see. It gets harder and harder when we had 20 million customers, let's make it easier and churn rate was 2% that means we had to make up 400,000 a month to grow. Now we have 30 million for churns to now we're going to make up 600,000 just to stay easy. If you got to 40 million and that would be 800,000, so and you see it with a lot of big Pay-TV services and a lot of the wireless guys, it gets harder and harder to offset that churn. That said we see subscriber growth for many years to come, which means we see revenue growth for many years to come and obviously EBITDA growth for many years to come. We haven't given a forecast beyond this year. Philip Cusick Let me follow-up on the first question and you mentioned when customers have to demand that there's going to streaming product within your application you’ll need to provide it? What our customers telling you today, do they want that today? James Meyer Today, they don't tell us they want it. It's very, very interesting as I told you, I keep waiting only talk to customers and for them to say what I really want there's a spotify like experience. That's not what we're hearing and I mean I can’t be emphatic enough here. But most of them are saying is I'm just not going to pay. Philip Cusick They want to curious radio type… James Meyer That's what they want. In our customers love our curation and not to bore, I had a root canal yesterday morning and my dentist is an avid – this guy is an avid listener of SiriusXM, and talking about everyone of our channels while he's working away and of course, I can't answer, right. So – but he came back and when he came back to me as I love the curation and the way you do it, about say some interesting about him, which is interesting about our customers., if you got his age, he was 59 or 60 years old, okay, affluent obviously gets a charge dentist rates, right and he loves classic vinyl and those kind of channels and yet, it's always that fifth when we never get right that makes our service work. He loves Broadway show tunes. We would have never been able to guess that was something that he loved and I find that more and more as subscribers, we know a little bit about their age and a little bit about where they live or what they do. We can get their three or four first channels right. It's always that fifth one that completely surprises us where they discover something they don't think they can get somewhere else. Philip Cusick I thinking in mind, top 20. James Meyer What’s it? Philip Cusick Top 20, line them up, all right, good. Let's talk a little bit more about the used opportunity and then we'll finish it up. As you think about growing into that big sort of used base, what are the couple of things that are really on the focus for the next year that you need to change, you can continue to drive that? James Meyer So I want to be clear – my message to the investors is clear. Our penetration in these used cars is just math, okay. I mean and again as I said earlier, it can't be a used car until it's been a new car. If we continue at our high-70s penetration, 17 million kind of SAAR, okay. There's more than double that used car sold. And so eventually, those two penetration rates have to catch up, right. So our opportunities for trials from the used car should double over the next five to 10 years and it’s just math, okay. I mean really it’s just math. Well then what's so complicated about? There are two things that are very complicated about it. One is in a new business, not only is our relationship with the auto is important because they install our technology, but they also send us a sold record like you buy a car on Saturday, we get that sold record with your name, address, and phone number almost immediately so we can begin marketing to you, okay. That's really, really powerful. In the used market, they don't get that data, okay. And so we're now out building all that data. Today we have 25,000 dealers that report to us every day. Here are the cars we took in on trade that have satellite radio and then in the evening they send us a data saying, here is all the cars we sold today with satellite radio. Here is a name, address, and phone number. That's still not good enough to be able to get as big amount of data as we want. And so when you buy a new car, for you it's a new car, but a used car, right, generally most of them are financed, generally most of them are insured, so now we're working with finance companies and insurance companies to get that owner data as well. And I'll tell you the area where we're really finding to be very fertile is service locations, places like oil change shops, places tire shops, places like that where they actually do record the car by VIN number and the name and the car comes in and we're really making a lot of progress. I think today we have over 14,000 of those locations reports. So the first thing that's necessary to drive the used business, we have to know who bought that vehicle and be able to market them in a timely basis. The second challenge is going to be a little tougher and that is the demographic of those buyers is going to be different, okay. Today our average subscribers in their upper 40s and makes $115,000 a year. Obviously that doesn't describe America, right. Americas obviously younger than that and not as wealthy as that. And so as more and more used car buyers come to us, we're going to have to very, very smartly and very, very carefully manage that value equation for them as we transition and that content equation, okay. And so for instance a car that's on its third owner and might be 10 or 11 years only has two years left or three years left, we might have a very different approach for selling a subscription in that vehicle than we do some who just bought a brand new car that's got 12 years a life or whatever, 14 or whatever it maybe. Also there's a variety of pricing tradeoffs in there that will need to make as we try to go after a lower demographic and we need to be very careful. That's why when I say it's going to be done very, very carefully and very, very systematically that we don't disrupt this big base that we have that's paying us almost $16 a month today right. So I'm really excited about it. We have a great CMO, Kathy Thomson joined us a couple of years ago. This is a huge amount of our focus as we understand those tradeoffs and I can assure investors that will be all over this for many, many years to come to maximize not just the yield of this funnel the use funnel or not just the yield of the new funnel, but how do we maximize both of those yields to generate the most revenue and EBITDA.

Unidentified Analyst You and David have been skeptical about streaming services in the past, has anything changed in that respect? James Meyer Well, I don't know that I've been skeptical about streaming. I want to be clear, I love streaming as a technology. It's one of the arguments, I work for Mel Karmazin for eight years, but I love working for Mel. But Mel saw streaming as a competitor. I see streaming as a technology and the rules vote it, right. I mean there's not a human in the world don’t have one of these, okay. And so we shouldn't care how customers listen. We should only care that they listen and pay us. And so I don't care, which device they listen to. I only care that they listen. The streaming businesses today I think have challenged economics and what we keep asking ourselves is, if we were to get involved in one of those businesses, how can we change that equation perhaps in a way that would be beneficial for our shareholders? That's a tough question. I love spotify. I read about them all the time. I use their product all the time. At some point, they're going to have to make money. And I'm not sure how easy that's really going to be, right. And so those business models challenge us. The other thing we're really careful, and I want to be clear here and maybe we're not getting it right, but we think we really are seeing it crystal clear. We don't want to be in the music distribution business. Music has been distributed for 50 years. There are records and then eight tracks and then cassettes and then CDs and then downloads, and now downloads being replaced perhaps by $10 a month, let’s call it a lease business. Those are different than the business we’re in. We’re in the radio business. We’re not in the music distribution business. We want to be careful with jumping over that void. Now I will tell you one thing. We're spending a lot of money on streaming. We're spending a lot of money – we have a big team working on significantly improving our apps and significantly improving the services that are available on those apps. And the day our customers say to us, hey Jim, I know you drew this line between these $10 services and something else. I expect to get that from you. We’ll have to give it to them. We’ll go develop that service and provide it to them. Unidentified Analyst When you stream your service, you confirm to the CRB rates that are relevant to your satellite service or do the CRB rates that are set by the SoundExchange for webcasting? James Meyer Our streaming product complies with the SoundExchange for webcast. Unidentified Analyst With some of the deals that have been done recently for webcasting at very high rates, does that have any relationship to your upcoming CRB discussions? James Meyer Not that we see at all, no. Unidentified Analyst Okay, thanks. Philip Cusick There was one here. Unidentified Analyst While you walkover, let's follow-up on the advertising model. Those streaming services are all driven by advertising, but your advertising business has been ramping up as well. What is the ad load on your product today and how are you selling it and how do you expect it to grow? James Meyer Well, I mean we don't have any ads on our music channels and at least as long as I’m in-charge we never well, okay. Our customers value commercial free in music and we need to protect that value equation with customers everywhere we can. On our talk channels, we do sell ads and frankly it's necessary because there are natural breaks in talk channels. I'll give example Howard Stern, he needs to take a break every so often and we run those ads when he's on break. Our ad business today is I think in the $140 million range, our total revenues in the $5.3 billion range. So it's 2% of our revenue growing to 3%. I’d love to grow it one day to 5% of our revenue. I don't know whether we'll be able to do that or not, okay. And so it's funny I just spoke to our whole ad sales force last week until now great, everything is and they are, they're growing double-digit and I love it.

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. David Baggs, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation. David Baggs Thank you, Sherlyn, and good morning everyone. On behalf of the management team I would like to welcome you to our first quarter earnings call, and also thank you for your interest in CSX Corporation. This morning we are being represented by our Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison; our Chief Marketing Officer, Fredrik Eliasson; our Chief Financial Officer, Frank Lonegro; and our Chief Operating Officer; Cindy Sanborn. Now, before we begin the formal part of our presentation this morning, let me remind everyone that the presentation materials, our safety and service measures, our quarterly financial report and our press release announcing our new guidance and dividend and share repurchase are all found on our website at CSX.com under the investors section. In addition, following this presentation later today, our webcast replay and the 10-Q will be filed. And so now let me turn your attention to Slide 2 of our presentation. Here are our forward-looking disclosure statements outlines the risks and uncertainties of forward-looking statements. There will be a number of them this morning during our presentation, and I imagine quite a few during our question-and-answer session. So I would encourage you to take those forward-looking statements in the full context of this disclosure statement. On Slide 3 is our non-GAAP disclosure statement. While CSX does file all of its financials in accordance with US GAAP, we are providing some non-GAAP financial measures in addition to the GAAP financial measures to help you better understand the business. But these measures are not a substitute for GAAP. Finally, I would say that we have close to 30 analysts this morning, and so I would encourage everyone to play nicely in the sandbox, so to speak. You will have one primary and one follow-up question, so that everyone can be heard and we use everyone’s time wisely. And before I turn the presentation over to the team, let me also remind you that the earnings call today is limited to discussions of the earnings and the business of CSX only, and we will not touch upon matters that are currently the subject of the company’s annual meeting.  And with that, it is my great pleasure and privilege to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Hunter Harrison.  Hunter Harrison Thank you, David, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. I guess my first comment would be I am back. I didn't think this is going to happen, but [Indiscernible] hopefully – well, not hopefully, I think factually my last leg on this journey that I have taken on this railroad, [Indiscernible]. In the 50 years did I ever think that I would finish in Jacksonville a group of railroaders with the talent that they did this, and the franchise that is before us, and I am very, very excited about the opportunity. I met yesterday with the first board meeting, formally with our board. I think it is safe to say that all of us were pretty excited about the opportunities going forward. As I found here, [Indiscernible] there is a group of [railroaders]. There might be a little shift in direction, but this company is going to achieve things that some of you don't think could be achieved. I'm not going to spend a lot of your time on the first quarter because I was only here for 30 days, and the three leaders here with their team produced those results are going to spend some time going through that with you. I certainly think it was a pretty outstanding quarter. As an outsider certainly looking in and it builds the foundation for us to go forward on with our plans for the future. I would say that I was reflecting this morning on what I might say here today and I know if you look at the various [Indiscernible] that we deal with, certainly our investors are represented – certainly our employees are represented. The one group that is so important to us that is not represented directly that I am [Indiscernible], and I am extremely excited. If you look at our service offering as it is today, there is a lot yet to learn but pretty good job in our bulk movement and cycles. Do a good job in the intermodal area. I think all of us would say that in our core merchandise category, we can make some significant improvement. I think the [majority] have already started down that road. And I think you will see some what I would characterize as some pretty dramatic changes in our cycles and I think you will see things like from Chicago to Florida markets that we will take two and three days out of that as a result of some strategies you are going to hear about today. So I think that is pretty exciting for the customer base. So without me taking additional time let me turn it over to the team here, and let Frank give us some observations on the results in the quarter. Frank Lonegro Thanks Hunter, and good morning everyone. Consistent with the transformation that we are undertaking through Precision Scheduled Railroading under Hunter’s leadership and knowing that you are eager to ask questions this morning, we are going to be very efficient in the way that we discuss the numbers. So with that as a backdrop, let us turn to Slide 7. The safety of our employees in the communities that we serve will continue to be a top priority for CSX and for this leadership team. While the personal-injury frequency index was 9% higher year-over-year the absolute number of injuries was down slightly, and that is part of our continuing drive towards the ultimate goal of zero injuries. Our train accident frequency index was 25% improved with substantially fewer reportable incidents. In terms of efficiency, we are continuing to drive both train length improvements and fuel efficiency gains, while our service levels remain stable on a year-over-year basis. Cindy Sanborn Thanks Frank. Let me just add a little bit. First of all, it is very exciting to be working with Hunter here, and as the operating leader spend a lot of time with him. And so I will talk a little bit about the quarter, but I will talk about going forward how we are working on some of the items that Hunter has briefly alluded to this morning. First of all, as you would expect, and has always been the case for CSX safety is our highest priority, and we will continue to focus on that not only employee injury performance, but train accidents in order to improve or make sure that the communities that we operate through we operate through safely. Turning to productivity, in the first quarter we delivered $123 million worth of savings. Significant resource productivity drove this. Continued train length opportunities and reduction in crew starts, and also we saw some other support costs, particularly in engineering and mechanical labor cost also affecting us positively in the quarter. But I think what we really want to hit on here is how we think about our business going forward to drive to and in the past six weeks we have done a couple of key things I will just highlight this morning. One, we have adapted our operating plans to incorporate some of our unit train business into our merchandise business – merchandise service. And this allows us to do a couple of things, as you think about our 28 hour train dispatch, our variable train dispatch, we did that in order to improve our train length and we have done that and very successful with it. But I think what is helping us continue to move forward with train length and cycle time improvement is adding the vast network into the merchandise service, so now we can have a more balanced network with a more highly likely probability of seven-day a week service and still keeping the length of the trains where it is productive. This also serves our customers well as we are able to improve dwell time in our terminals as a result of these changes. The second item that we have been working on is reduce our – changing or converting our switching operations in some of our traditional pump yards into a flat yard model. We have 12 pump yards across the system. To date we have converted four of those over into flat switching operations. This has allowed us to reduce – support resource efficiencies, particularly in managing the infrastructure that is necessary to support in pump yards, in the pumping process, reduce that as well as at the end our plan has been focusing on improving the cycle times through those terminals. So we have been able to do both of those things. As we look forward, we expect to continue to reduce several pump yards. We don't have a hard and fast specific number. We look at each one individually. We will make sure we are making the right decisions to improve both productivity and service. And I would also say that as we look at our quarter one measurements, our network performance measurements we are seeing as we have implemented some of these changes I am talking about, improved dwell time, improved velocity across the network and we think that will compound the effect of some of the changes that we are making to lead us to feel very comfortable moving forward that will actually have record productivity in 2017 following our previous record productivity in 2015. So overall I think the team is doing very well coming together with some significant changes as we adjusted to the reductions in management headcount as part of our first quarter initiative. We saw a lot of change there and we are continuing to see change, and we are driving that effectively I believe, and we will continue to do so incorporating that into our business model going forward. Frank Lonegro Thanks Cindy. Those are great insights for the analysts and for the investors. Going forward as we implement Precision Scheduled Railroading you will see what we believe is a powerful combination of improved safety, improved service and improved efficiency that exemplifies a great railroad. We believe that that powerful combination will benefit employees, customers and shareholders alike. Turning to Slide 8, the GAAP view of our income statement highlights the 10% year-over-year top line improvement, which has been achieved through a combination of volume growth, higher fuel surcharge recoveries, favorable mix and value pricing. Volume is up 3% with pricing on a same-store sales basis increasing 3.9% all in ,  and 2.5% excluding coal, driving revenue per unit up 7%. Looking at the expenses at a high level, total costs were up $243 million, with a $173 million restructuring charge accounting for most of that year-over-year increase. As for the charge of the combined impact of increased fuel prices, inflation and volume, were nearly offset by the $123 million of efficiency savings that you heard Cindy reference. The focus on cost control and a rising volume environment produced incremental margins of over 70%, excluding the charge. Bottom line, ex-charge CSX delivered record first-quarter operating ratio of 69.2%, operating income of $885 million, and a record first quarter EPS of $0.51.  Turning to Slide 9, these financial results drove over $1 billion in operating cash flow, a nearly $300 million year-over-year improvement. This improvement carried through to free cash flow before dividends of $630 million. Earlier this morning we announced a free cash flow target of around $1.5 billion for the year, which takes into consideration the combined impact of our earnings trajectory and a Capex reduction of over $100 million. We continue to remain focused on returning capital to shareholders through a balanced deployment strategy. In the quarter, we distributed $166 million to shareholders in the form of dividends, while repurchasing 258 million of CSX shares. Having now completed the two-year $2 billion program we commenced in April of 2015, we were pleased to announce a new one-year $1 billion buyback program earlier this morning. While ROIC was stable on a year-over-year basis, we fully expect that it will inflect more positively going forward as we continue to increase efficiency and reduce the asset intensity of our railroad. Debt-to-EBITDA was also relatively stable as we continue to appropriately utilize our balance sheet and remain committed to a BBB+ Baa1 credit-rating. Turning to Slide 10, the volume outlook for the second quarter is largely positive with nearly 70% of our markets in the favorable category and over 20% of our markets in the neutral activity. Only domestic coal is expected to be unfavorable in the second quarter. Fredrik Eliasson To just add a little color to that, if you look at the macroenvironment, several indicators support continued growth. Obviously the economy continues to grow at a modest pace, GDP in the 2% to 2.5% range for the full year and probably a similar pace in the second quarter itself. The consumer sentiment continues to be at high levels, which helps many of our markets especially the intermodal market. At the same time though the truck market right now continues to see excess capacity. But as we move through the year we do expect that to gradually improve in the second half and into ’18. And then, of course, on the favorable side export coal had a very strong year in the first quarter, 8.7 million tons that we moved in the first quarter. We do expect that to taper off as we move through the year, but we still think that an upper 20 million range in terms of tons for the full year on the export side is a good estimate at this point. As we think about some of the headwinds, we think that auto production is clearly flattening out, and we think for the rest of the year relatively flat. It is probably a good place to think about the auto business, and then while the core chemical market continues to grow at a nice pace we expect crude by rail to continue to decline both year-over-year and sequentially as we move through the rest of 2017. And then of course on the unfavorable side, we see our domestic coal business. We talked about it in the fourth quarter, we lost some short-haul business but despite that we did about 15 million tons here in the first quarter on the domestic side and we expect a similar pace in the second quarter. But as you saw in the first quarter the quality of the revenue and the impact to the bottom line is still very strong and we expect that to continue as we move through the year. It is obviously reflected in our RPU. So I would say overall we feel good about the top line. We continue to expect our merchandise and intermodal business to grow at or above the economy as a whole, and it is nice to see coal revenue to be growing a little bit here this year as well. And lastly and echoing Cindy’s comments earlier, we are very excited about what this operating model can do for CSX, not just in terms of the bottom line, but really what it can do for our customers. We are already seeing that from a service perspective both in terms of transit time, reliability and recoverability. So we feel very good about this change.  Michael Ward Thanks Fredrik. A very helpful again commentary for the investors and for the analysts. Let us finish up on Slide 11, with our first quarter results we are off to a very good start in 2017 and expect to accelerate the transformation to Precision Scheduled Railroading in the coming quarters. Earlier this morning you saw that we issued full year guidance, excluding restructuring charges. To that end in 2017 CSX expects to achieve a mid-60s operating ratio, record efficiency gains that you heard Cindy mention, EPS growth of around 25% off of 2016’s reported EPS of $1.81 and free cash flow before dividends of around $1.5 billion. In issuing these expectations we assume, of course, that the coal markets and the overall economy will remain stable. This morning we were also pleased to announce 11% or $0.02 increase in the quarterly dividend along with a new one-year $1 billion share buyback program. And finally we look forward to sharing our longer-term plans with you in the second half of the year.  With that we will be delighted to take your questions this morning. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Brian Ossenbeck Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Hunter, I guess my first one for you I know with have a scheduled day later in the year perhaps to hear more about the longer-term plan, but the initial impressions that were laid out in the file, could you just give us some context in terms of where do think the significant opportunities are to further streamline the network, you talked about monetizing real estate, which is a target that – any specific when you are there, and just in general if you think there is just too much track with too few [Indiscernible] going over there, just the ability to improve the network density and the design as you move forward over the next couple of years? Hunter Harrison Let me – I don’t think that this franchise is significantly different than others that we have overlaid this model with. Cindy touched on a lot of these things, and as we have talked internally, we don't have some ironclad numbers on what the headcount number got to be, what the pump closures got to be. It is going to be what is smart to do. I don’t think that I have spent a great deal of time with Cindy and her team. We are – I think step one was cutting through a lot of bureaucracy. We are getting through where we had nine-divisions, and so we are going to be going down to maybe a couple. [Indiscernible] just cost money, and I think we are trying to streamline that. We are trying to get the right leadership in the right spot. We have got nine dispatching offices. I don't think any railroad has nine dispatching offices, and we are going to make some efforts there. There is efforts going on now promoting productivity, I would expect before the summer is up, we will have 550 or so locomotives [restored]. We will probably have 25,000 freight cars put up, and all of the associated costs that go with them, labor, material, and the locomotive fuel productivity, velocity, and a lot of things, dwell time in terminals I would say would come down dramatically. Some of our facilities historically have they been overbuilt? Yes.  Like the auto railroad. But this railroad has had a special challenge. If you look back at the mergers, there were more companies involved with mergers of that what is now the CSX than any other major railroad. So if you are going to place [Indiscernible] and we have four or five yards, well, it is because you have money to have a yard there if you go through some of these common points. So, we are doing some things. For example, [Indiscernible] is a good example, where I think we have four yards there. Cindy is helping me here, and I think we will be down to, maybe there is one super operation there. But I know we have a track of land there that is an operating proxy that needs to be a good deal of money. So there is going to be some monetization of assets. So this is going to be more of the same at maybe a more rapid pace taking advantage of larger opportunities. Brian Ossenbeck Okay, great. Thanks Hunter. So, just one quick follow-up just on the coal side, Frank or Fred, if you could just give us a sense is that the export market price and that really spiked pretty much after the quarter ended. So, just want to see if you thought that the mix, the favorable benefit that you saw in the first quarter is something that you would also be able to capture in the second and third quarter? Thank you. Frank Lonegro Well, thank you. We don't forecast size, but we have said overall, over time that we do have indexes on our contracts on the export side that when things go well we share some of those economics, and when things aren’t as well, we take some of that pain. Clearly this quarter, it wasn’t just export pricing that helped. We also see some pretty favorable mix and a lot of that mix we do expect to continue, but it of course, depends on where we see the utility business, for example, go in terms of resale replenishment of the inventories of through the years. So, I think there's a favorable mix story and favorable sort of going forward but I think it's unclear at this point how favorable it's going to be through the year. Brian Ossenbeck Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee Hi, great. Thanks, and good morning. Michael Ward Good morning. Chris Wetherbee I want to touch on the volume side, Hunter. If you could just sort of give your initial impressions on what you give sort of volume opportunities that are out there for CSX, obviously playing in the E3 automatically kind of think of the intermodal market and efficiency obviously played big and to being able to gain shareable from truck as well as your rail competitors. Can you give us a sense as what your initial impressions are about sort of the franchise there and how you think about that going forward? Hunter Harrison Well, I'm obviously in 30 days, I've limited amount of knowledge. I will say that I think one of these starting things going forward with this organization as well as rail overall is the opportunity catch before us to get this off the hour. And I think that we're set up in almost a perfect storm here to take advantage of that. If you look at that we have we start with a strong base to begin with, with great market that we serve up and down the East Coast and Chicago, Florida, and some really some growth areas, where there is congestion, the highway systems aren’t going to be able to contemplate everything. If you look at the advantages of rail would, from an environmental standpoint, from an energy standpoint. And if you look at an organization that is going to be able to take a combination of dual times and terminals about limiting terminals, which lowers cost, that at the same time then takes dual times now from an average of effectively a day or 25 hours or 26 hours of dual, down to 18 or so, and you say we're going to skip some terminals and you start to look at really what we used to talk about the strong competitive, that is not strong competitive, it's better than pro. Now, the issue is the change and is tried to take that to the market place and to sell it and converted and change it. But that's where look the individual markets, I mean this can be just as we guess more the competitors out there, we'll stretch and fighting and win the business there. The real opportunity has been is on the in the high wall. Chris Wetherbee Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up thinking about some of the guidance and we had to think about it a little bit beyond 2017. So, mid-60s for this year, we're having pull forward some of the benefit, but clearly some of the things you are going to be doing are going to be gaining traction as the year progresses. Presumably you'll be entering 2018 at a better run rate. So, obviously I'm trying to jump the gun here a little bit and get some of this forward. Look, before you might be ready to give it but when you think about 2018, and I think you got it wrong in the respect that it is sort of natural that some of the benefits you're acquiring in 2017 will be playing out in 2018 and maybe we're thinking about something like the low 60s or show a warn in 2018? Hunter Harrison Is that based -- send me your mail, Chris, and I'll fill it in. I think you're right on. Look, this is not the first time this movie played out. We see opportunities, not going to happen overnight. Is it going to exactly linear? No. will be there be a fair step approach? Yes. Do we have any barriers here? Structural issues, as we deal with the board discuss, we can't do what's been done before. And even go beyond that? No reason. Chris Wetherbee Got you, that makes sense. Thanks very much, it's worth the shot. I appreciate it. Hunter Harrison Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Tom Wadewitz Yes, good morning. Hunter Harrison Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz Hunter, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the opportunity at CSX versus what you saw at CP. I think of your approach being one of the things you do is simplify the flow of traffic and reduce work event. If CSX has a greater complexity and the network begin with versus CP, that would have find maybe greater opportunity for cost take out in or as you take out that, that complexity right simplify things. So, that's the right framework and I wanted to see if you could comment on that and maybe compare the opportunity you see so far at CSX versus what you had at CP. Hunter Harrison Well, I mean, Tom, they're totally different franchises. The maker, the market. As generally speaking, a lot of roads are in North America. So, you look behind your belt and you say look what is the best way to operate and run this franchise and I think that the -- there is a lot of talk about this is not a simple T operation that it got all the complexities and the density and the spaghetti bowls. Well, the waiting, the hand led, eat his spaghetti and get rid of it. So, one of the things we've done, is the same the time we work diligently on is being sure that we're not going through terminals and process and cars just because the terminals there. So, it's almost kind of the old term we use before the wide motocross, let's start on with this franchise. The last, and I was there yesterday when I talked to group but the last stop yard, it was built in North America, the last two, with one and way across which is the heart of this CSX in my view. And the other one was our [indiscernible] in mid-80s. Markets have changed since mid-80s. Demand of traffic that's bulk, that is intermodal, that is very nearly -- true trends. It don’t have to be sold it in Swiss, so you adopt that year your operating strategies to the market. And I just think that there's much more of a natural fit to make some of the changes that we need to make here that will present even more opportunities to both year point for the complexity as said in the past and built in and simplified. This franchise, if you apply the marker here to some degree, adds more potential than anyone up there will. Tom Wadewitz Okay, great, that's helpful, I appreciate it. Then the second question of the follow-up would be, CSX approached intermodal has benefit different than I think what typical if you look at Norfolk, they have the corridor strategy. I think that will be more characteristic maybe of the Canadian road. But CSX has this Baltimore Ohio hub strategy, and has talked about one in the South East. Do you think that is the right approach to continue or do you think on the intermodal network is their opportunity to maybe simplify and go towards more of a kind of a origin to destination as opposed to sending it to the hub that you have in Baltimore Ohio? Thank you. Hunter Harrison Well, Tom, I don’t want to get into about there. I'm sure the people here they’ve have potentially a different better strategy given what they had to work with. The operating groups challenge is to present velocity and speed in customer requirements to the marketing sales group and then given how well that service going to apply to the market, then its spreads changed job into this end of service to take that to the market. And I think a better product raw product this Wendy and team can produce the more successful and more latitude, it will give thread and technique till I think that I think the competition, we're going to get bears in our rear view mirror and they're going to be looking at the rear, we're going to be pass him on the left. Tom Wadewitz Okay, great. Thank you for the time, Hunter, I appreciate it. Hunter Harrison Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Allison Landry Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hunter, Chicago has always been at the forefront of your mind and historically you've made comments that CSX used the Chicago belt and perhaps the Indiana belt for switching more than any of the other rail. So, now that you're in arguably a much better see to effects change. Do you have any plan to pick Chicago and if so could you provide some content surrounding that? Hunter Harrison I don’t know that how quick to pick Chicago. But Chicago is a special issue. And if you noticed in a lot of our what we've discussed and talked about, it hadn’t included Chicago, but those Chicago we here affectively carved out and are taking a different special type look at. Chicago has some real challenges to this all North American infrastructure. Chicago cannot survive as it is today. You got law suits now, the imminent domain, had you want to take rail infrastructure to replace it with that one. You got it right beside all here. Okay. Everybody wants to grow, they want to grow in Chicago and it's not going to work. Now, the plus for us is this. We own a lot of assets in Chicago and we can be a more significant player that in positions that been in the past. And only one move could change things in Chicago and so people have to be aware of it and not I don’t read, I'm not going to mention the term but just a stroke of a pen of a partnership could shift a lot of track away from Chicago, and infrastructure thing to people think it's need for Chicago will be needed. For example, if you look at Kansas City today. Kansas City used to be a Chicago. And we were little late in the real business and built tons of infrastructure and now you look at Kansas City and it's pretty much rail business relative to the infrastructure. So, Chicago is going to be gravy on top of this plan of what we eventually decide we're able to do with our partners and fellow owners and all the other entities that want to be part of Chicago. So, it’s real opportunity is that we're taking a special look at. Allison Landry Okay. And when you refer to the stroke of a pen of a partnership, is that a single partnership that you have in mind or could it be multiple? Hunter Harrison Look, I don’t have anything in mind. I got four years contract, I want to go out and CSX with a green, with a blue and gold jersey running under the goal post, okay. If even if I want to do something after that, it's up to them. I'm only pointing out that one of the challenges that's brought to my attention, almost every time, I'd be with the big customer, is real consolidation. And in spite of the fact that which you might hear, in proper statement, we got to LA to a customer in South and West of adding service to New York and I'll talk to you about half of it. They don’t want to hear about half of it, they want to hear about all of it. And until one easy and control movement rail is never going to have the competitive alternative to the highway. But what I'm just pointing out that for a lot of these reasons, Chicago was kind of a wild card. Allison Landry Okay. And then, as a follow-up question, how are you thinking about the coal network or other areas of the network that doesn't necessarily have as much density as you would like. And I know there was sort of a question earlier in this round. But ask a little bit differently, is there any opportunity to short line any of this business and are there any carriers or holding companies that you think would be a good fit? Hunter Harrison Now, look I think that -- I think that you give us off to and buy into, what we say we're going to do, that you don’t need to think about short liners all the time. I do think that we do domestically move coal a little bit different than I'm traditionally used to, in a very disciplined close loop unit train operation that can be much more efficient. You can't move unit train coal train for three days and then park them two days and then run them for three days and then move again to very efficiently. Now if you do that there is a higher pulse associated with it with higher cost maybe comes the higher price. So what we are trying to do both with the -- is to create and encourage our super stores with us to create more disciplined approach what we can do with [indiscernible] and fewer locomotives and we can be more competitive for them and give them a constant supply of coal which is what they want and if we developed the reliability we need then it will all come together. Allison Landry Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the time.  Operator Thanks. The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question, Amit Mehrotra Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the operating expectations for this year. It looks like the OR target of the mid 60s implies around 800 million year-over-year on your profit improvement. It just seems by our estimate at least that only about 300 million of that will come from revenue growth and improved fixed cost absorption which leaves about call it somewhere close to half a billion dollars of absolute reduction in the cost base. So first of all is that the type of cost take out that you hunter in the team and are targeting to realize this year and just for our own, my own avocation, how does one achieve sort of half a billion dollar of cost take out without maybe driving a significant amount of disruption at least in the near term. Thank you. Frank Lonegro Amit, let me, it's Frank, let me take that one first and then turn it over to Hunter for additional commentary. In the targets that we gave you one of the things that we mentioned was record productivity embedded within that is obviously the prior record of $427 million in 2016 so clearly you can have your own estimate in terms of how much we will exceed that to a very good start in terms of the $123 million of efficiency. I think from just a line item perspective other than fuel you should expect us to continue to drive cost out across the board in terms of the various items there when you look at better service you look better productivity, you look at the ability to absorb volume with literally no additional cost associated with that, you get huge flow through from what your expectations are on the revenue side. So we are kicking one off cylinders here in terms of the volume side, the pricing side and the efficiency side so that's what gave us the confidence to put out the targets that we did this morning. Michael Ward Yes, I mean I don't want to add more example that which you want to look at odd numbers just the achieve it. Taking on some initiative to take the 1000 position, those 1000 positions were a lot of more voluntary and there was store room that is what we are all position that has not touch any of the [inaudible] we are going to utilize the people internally we have, we are very sensitive to your comment about the disruption and the moral and we have at [inaudible] but it is a little higher when normal and so I think if you had the [inaudible] member on it and I haven’t got into that kind of level yet but I think the potential is there that sometime around the first half of the year by the end of, there would be probably be a similar number taken out also now we didn’t take any of those to take some real cost without impacting the service or safety or anything else. These are just a different ways to doing things. We are bringing some job own. We have, I don’t know all of that, 250 or 300 boys in India, we are reviewing those jobs back here but [inaudible] also some job but I am really [inaudible] worried about India right now I am worried about CSX [inaudible] America, so there is a lot of opportunity and I don’t think that there was a breach as far as we do the job and we have the ability to do that we can achieve all these things that we dealt that. Frank Lonegro Okay, one other point on the folks in India, there are contractors not employees but obviously we're going to in source that work and really look to absorb that with the existing workforce. I know Cindy also had some points, she wanted to make here. Cindy Sanborn I just put it in a couple of broad categories as I think about it. [inaudible] mentioned the reduction in the management that took place last month, I think as you think about [inaudible] conversions and so forth those types of actions I would call core operations and we expect to do more of that. Volume absorption, we are seeing our outlook with a higher level of volume for us to move and we think we can absorb that of more efficiently than putting resources back one for one and then I would also say, some of the, looking back and some of the improvements that we have made other railroads [inaudible] I would call it network efficiency cars online velocity [inaudible] those types of things, we think will see improvement improvements there. So I would call that just network efficiencies going forward. And when you put all that together that's what's given us our confidence to move forward with that with another record here. Amit Mehrotra Right. Well thanks for all that. Let me just ask one follow up if I could. Frank, on your comments about productivity, maybe I'm thinking about incorrectly but I feel like productivity is different than absolute reduction in the cost structure? Because productivity is in my view the way I understand it you're optimizing the cost structure to maximize the incremental, may be minimized to detrimental but it doesn't necessarily mean the cost structure is declining. So you guys achieved 72% incremental operating margin in the quarter which is unbelievably great. Is there a way to understand or help us in terms of what was that was actually fix cost absorption? What was that actually absolute reduction the cost structure? Frank Lonegro So, when we think about productivity and how, I would say keep score internally, we do look for structural cost reductions. So a big part of that record productivity, structural cost reductions meaning each line item in the expenses is going to get lower again I'm excluding fuel just given the price environment that we're in but we are focused on fuel efficiency as well. I think there as you can see from an incremental margin perspective, we're also a very good start with about 72% incremental for the first quarter when you understand what we're trying to do on the cost side and you will understand what the volume outlook looks like I would estimate that the incremental margins were actually improve throughout the year which is going to give you the bottom line to flow through the revenue that we are bringing up. Amit Mehrotra That's great. Hunter, one last one for me if I could. Can you just comment on your relationship with the union so far? You have the company has over 20,000 union employees, can you just talk about those initial meetings and conversations and just in the context of all the operational changes to come? That’s it for me. Thank you. Hunter Harrison Well, I hope it's pretty good. I've worked most of my career. The first four years alongside of the various roles that now make up the effects and those some of the leadership I've had some, I mean terrible what I say here, I had some bad things conversations, exploring new opportunities with those individuals. It's not real common for a new CEO to get me in and I don't care what your name is in the labor leaders to be bringing in a [inaudible] that just now, [inaudible] but at the same time I [inaudible] to be approached unofficially at least, the conversations about potentially there was something like an hourly agreements that has been extended in some part of the US system and now the Canadian national that we developed. It is very encouraging to say that, even that there are dialogue like that and one of the things that, the beauty of that would be, a couple of things that the people should think that one: those agreements guarantee people position that’s important today people they certainly have job and they have the job guarantee and that’s very important in people and at the same time for us it lowers our, potentially our cost, 30% to 35%. So we're going to have some squabbles. They don't like to see their people disrupted nor do I but you got to do which you got to do some time. And so there'll be some, I'm sure there'll be some, comment but all I care about is the bottom line and profit and I hope that in turn we're very sensitive to the employees in the part they play in this. So I think we'll do fine with it. Amit Mehrotra Okay. Thank you for answering my questions, I appreciate it. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ravi Shankar Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hunter, just to summarize tie-up everything you said in the call so far in terms of playbook the precision railroading playbook that you've so effectively deployed several times before at other railroads, do you think that's kind of directly applicable to CSX here or do you think the complexity of the network here involves changes to the way that it's been under before and also CSX has in recent years had a playbook of deemphasizing coal and becoming more of an intermodal rail. Do you agree with that and do you think that kind of becomes part of your playbook as well. Hunter Harrison Well, the question was, yes it was. I think, is the more complexity there in the network the better model you can apply to it, you can get more advantages or opportunity but if you just got a linear street line railroad because there would be lot of people can do that into the model to that. So this has certainly, those implications. Now, strategically going down there in the line as to far as, look I think, if you look at three years out of five years, out of ten years that we need to understand that the world is going to continue to change though and we need to be flexible and to have a plan that allows us to change with those changes, okay. And we got things going on as we speak from energy standpoint, what is the future of fossil fuel, what is the future of crude, how much influence of the environment is going to have? What is the next we are going to do with the railroad, you go ahead inject rail, you drive manage huge warehouse of Amazon and so the supply chain is going to change and we have to be, going to be some of the game that are traditional [inaudible] we have to be more flexible and more creative to be able to deal with those changes in the world. Frank Lonegro I mean we have to emphasized call CSX, the coal has been the emphasize by the utility and so we want as much business as we can what is called, but we will deploy our strategy where we can capture the growth and create the bottom line value for CSX through excellent service to our customers. Ravi Shankar Got it and your vision of your intermodal, is this largely, I think you spoke about service initiatives a little earlier on the call, but it is largely a case of improving the service levels and gain to a point where it become super-competitive versus struck or are you looking for more demand improvement from macro or kind of being able to take price and segments. So between service and demand and price kind of which do you think is the most important level for intermodal?  Hunter Harrison I don’t know that, the market would have you believe, to begin with, we are not going to sit here and let our precious service the kind of commodity and so that there we create in service and I would [inaudible] at this we are just in time an intermodal get real hot, if you look back and do a little history, you will see that prior I am in, it was not going to our 20% [inaudible] you let interest rate and they are going back up after, I just can’t tell you when they do people do move merchandize will be rewarded because caring are going to go up. The beauty is this the quicker we move it, the cheaper it is and so it goes on itself and so we turn the equipment quicker, we give better service to the customer and we got the lower cost and then we can may more convincing and it all fits in this model. Ravi Shankar Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Hoexter Good morning. Hunter, you sound well I look forward to your tenure at CSX. If you noted you're going to be an advocate for customers in your intro remarks. Is that a change in how you're going to attack the plan? I mean after you've left obviously we heard keep talk about fixing ruffled feathers and a customer focus. So now it sounds like you start this with a little bit of a different tact. Maybe you can just talk about that a bit. Hunter Harrison I have in my whole career in fact one of the reasons why I'm sitting here was I have to be an operating guys that [inaudible] okay. I have got a little reputation [inaudible] people look at your bill and that wouldn't they do on the ground, but look there's no one more sensitive than I am and more [inaudible] than I am of the business that our customers yield, okay. I am the greatest advocate in the world which you could sit in some of our meetings when we talk about service and we talk about [inaudible] because that’s not just about creating pain and suffering for our customers which I don’t want to see creating. One example of a customer turn over a period just when we are going to do a transition that sense any problem or issue from it didn’t exist, okay. So I am going to do a little coaching couple of mine and actually anticipate had a response. Ken Hoexter Let me just read it, something you talked about on the union because the US has changed like historically have been a little bit different right in terms of all the rails coming to negotiating in one team against kind of the all the unions in one group. You always had things may be a little bit differently in Canada, can you, is that something you think you need to shift how you would address that as you move forward? Hunter Harrison Well, I think, if you look back, the parts when I was parts of the U.S. operation, we were not part of handling. So negotiated our labor agreement and then we can do that now we are going to have some dialog it appears to me and I have had a chance to some of my colleague about it but it appears to me that some of the big -- if you will or seven or they start to see the world differently than if they start to see the world differently and then on one page and that's makes a lot of sense to have this one big care conference negotiated for us. I would much prefer I think us to sit down with our employees and do what's the best for the organization and employee. So I think that all those things that deal with policies and all we will take a look at it and see how they see the world and how we see going forward and what's the most appropriate action. Operator Thanks. Your next questions comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. You may ask your question. Brandon Oglenski Yes good morning and thanks for taking my question and Hunter definitely welcome back and I know there is a lot of investors excited to see you back in the field. So surprisingly though it just keeps coming back we hear it a lot that length of farm, and the short length of farm from the east coast just means that the return on invested capital or the margin potential is not as high as railroads or some of the stuff going out, out west in the US can you just talk to that dynamic and whether or not you think length of plays a lot of determination in the ultimate profitability of the network. Hunter Harrison Well [indiscernible] the markets of the market. We don't get a chance to make the market. I know this the more productive we are the better we are at cost controlling that cut inflation -- controlling cost okay will put us in the position that says people used to say -- 800 miles plus you could make -- well that's not true. If you are operating -- 90s it's true. The operating ratio is 58 it's wrong. So it's I don't really, necessarily while on the short it's the bottom-line margin that we can make out the business and what I don't think we set the price out there. The market sets the price which we want to play or not. And we keep ourselves competitive with the market both with long and short term. Brandon Oglenski And if I could, kind of also that question maybe what Ken was asking well there is some fear that as you go through these operations changes and focus more on service that maybe some of your customers are disruptive from the way business is done in the past is there potential here that you see some share shift as you go through this transition period or do you think as service improve you could actually improve top line at the same time. Hunter Harrison Yes. That's the story. That's why you provide good service. It starts with your product but you don't have the product you don't have anything. So we start with the product and the better we make that product the more we can extract in value added both in market share and whatever the revenue. So this is not one set of the game. It's the revenue up and cost down and investor get rewarded and it's fun. Okay. Brandon Oglenski We look forward to Hunter. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Scott Group Hey thanks. Good morning everyone. So maybe Fredrik can you isolate the strength and export pricing from the mix benefit of losing the short haul business and understand what bigger impact in the quarter and can you just kind of confirm it if the guidance for the year assumes kind of export pricing stays where it is or that it does come down in the back half of the year and then bigger picture on call maybe for you Hunter, we can see this quarter how profitable the coal franchise is if we kind of assume that coal resumes at secured in the next couple of years do you think that maybe could impact the ability to get to us sub 60 OR in a couple of years? Fredrik Eliasson So let me take your first part of your question first. I would say that the majority of the [indiscernible] change was stable mix, with favorable mix on one hand that some of that short haul traffic obviously went away which was short in marginal but also we saw a more replenishment of utilities in the south versus last year where if you recall not for gas prices were tremendously low for design and then also on the export side we saw additional traffic going into the Virginia which is generally little bit of a export there that is longer length of haul so we had a couple of things that was favorable from a mix perspective that certainly helped so that was the majority of the driver that we saw. And then turning to question about the coal franchise to Hunter. Hunter Harrison My numbers, my analysis as a short timer don't include some big goal, if coal comes back stronger than anticipated it's very – will it change any of these numbers, I don't think so. If you look at the last story we get the same thing -- and you will get to the numbers well I think that group has done an excellent job and they continue to do it I think they bound through 60 it through with their life 58 so no I don't think that I have set longer term almost – western Canada that I can't retract it. I just take longer term coal is not something that rails should depend on. Now it can take a while to transition out it's not going to happen overnight and we might see another 10-15 years but longer term I don't think that fuel I mean coal is going to be the energy source of the future. Scott Group Okay and just the part about coal pricing assumed in the guidance in the back half. Hunter Harrison Well overall, side that we follow in this index after the variety of them and as you can see in the forward curve currently that is coming down as we move through second half of the year and that certainly then our expectations as well but we will ultimately see where the market ends up. Scott Group Okay. Thanks and then Hunter since this is your first call, there is couple of things that I want to address. There is some people that presume that ultimately M&A is part of the strategy and maybe you can talk about that and then also in some of your past, you have brought some people on in terms of the team should we be expecting something similar here? Hunter Harrison Well look I don't know what I can say but I would emphasize, okay M&A has nothing to do with this strategy here at all okay. And one thing I take very proud and the integrity okay I am telling you there is no such plan. Even I don't have hands I have got four years it's not going to happen in 10 years [indiscernible] is a lot to play with the hand and bill okay and we got a good hand here. Now do we have a couple of midst, maybe but we are looking internally in fact that was last night talking about some people. I am not sure that we have – that we have taken advantage of all the internal talents that we have here. But if we hint avoid that we have that we need then we can – we always have the ability to go externally. If there anybody wants to get the work force the list is long and we don't have any restrictions about who can leave and can't go here, they can't go there. We are okay, work here they can leave. Okay. In fact if they want to go some other railroad let them go. But we have got we will not have a short of talent and resources to be on the railroad that we described. Scott Group Okay. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Your line is open. Go ahead and ask your question. Jeff Kauffman Thank you very much. Welcome back, good to have you back on. My questions have been asked six ways to Sunday how CCX differs from some other rails you have been at but what I would like to know is at CP there needed to be a capital investment and sighting and some other portions of the rail to achieve the things you wanted to achieve. CN it was different investment can you talk a little bit not so much about multiple yards because we have been built through acquisition but talk about the capital plan at CCX and is there investment that needs to occur for what you need to do and kind of how we think about that strategically. Michael Ward Well. Overall just to look at it without starting to break it down, I think it's clear to me that the capital investment will come down overtime. It has been a good deal since the last few years about -- if you take a look at just what's been spent the last few years on locomotives you would say we are not going to have to do that for a while if we get 550-600 locomotives stored and I can know one of our previous experiences there that we count as numbers and we said well maybe we can take couple of year holiday for locomotives and we did and I think fifth year holiday. So well, we don't have to spend anything on locomotives generally for four, five years clearly a lot of the replacements that were issued with the yards are not there clearly if we have sighting that are too short for the longer train we are certainly not going to leave those sit on the ground and not being utilized so we will pick up 165 [indiscernible] railroad included with the another 6500 and that will we got 13000 and the only thing we capitalized is in the labor we don't have to capitalize the rail and so there is some ways save capital and another issue of overlook is this the better productivity you have with capital the more you can put in. the higher productive you are good in lower with 100 miles main productive stuff is the productivity factor -- but I think my numbers were that over three or four year period we can see 500-600 million reduction in the capital spend and then there are points where you will potentially trend back up and if we don't have something else like coming along to help with our capital spend and I am not big of some percent of revenue we should work that that way and out whatever is the revenue is but I think overall to answer your question there will be some positive for free cash flow out of the reduction in capital. Jeff Kauffman Okay. Well Hunter thank you for your answer and best of luck to you all at CCX. Thank you. Michael Ward Thanks Jeff .  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.  David Vernon Hey good morning. Hunter maybe just a quick question for you on the presence of the share asset areas the old legacy of acquisition is that sort of joint operations in some of the bigger eastern metros create any challenges or opportunities for you when you think about railroad model into the CFX? Michael Ward Well I don't have to, I have not spent in my first company days a lot of time in that area and I'm limited on my knowledge there and I don’t want to try to mess you with the stories that I've heard a lot of best of. Cindy, you got any comments there? Cindy Sanborn Yes David, I think we are always looking for efficiencies where we hand off car whether to the joint facility and then this car rail or IHP in Chicago and there's nothing that really jumps off the page but as we've said many, many times everything's on the table and if we can find opportunities, we will certainly take advantage of them. David Vernon But do you think there are any sort of constraints because you're tied to a schedule that maybe the Conrail serving for, that means both your and the Norfolk needs and it's harder to change or is that something that's probably not an issue? Cindy Sanborn That's really not an issue. It's in all of our best interest to serve our customer better and they just simply supply the last mile service and do a very good job of it and we work very closely together on making sure that the efficient and effective for customers. David Vernon Okay. And Fredrik, may be just as a quick follow-up, when you look at same store sales pricing, I hear your comments on mix in coal and I think what I've heard is where we should expect that to continue to happen but I think in the intermodal merchandise the deceleration in the core price, is that something that we should also expect to kind of happen here or we starting to see some signs of improvement in that domestic intermodal market that would help kind of assure that number? Fredrik Eliasson Well, this is just to clarify also and I am not sure that will really go to a question. The mix was obviously out of the same store sale number, which is why we are doing it. In fact, once again we don't forecast price but I think it's clear that we've been in a place over the last few years where there's been a fair amount of exits capacity in the marketplace and all our customers as Hunter alluded before have alternatives, so we have got a price-to-market. The key thing is, is I look forward now between what I think you guys write a lot about which is that there's a structural change coming and closing an attractable market with some of the ELD limitations and the shortage of drivers and hopefully getting to better placement and capacity perspective. And coupled that, what we're doing with this operating model where I already see a significantly improved service. I think there's an opportunity as we move into '18 to really capitalize on that. So we feel good about where we are, we've priced the market each and every day and as we move forward we will do the same. David Vernon But many as everything I worry are right now are we starting to see things kind of improve sequentially or we're still kind of in a soft patch on the domestic market? Fredrik Eliasson I see some opportunities on the stock market side I follow closely where things seems to be moving in the right direction. I do think that obviously if you see some of the -- and you thought this more than I do on the trucking side as there has been some challenges out there but I see that the light is coming close at the end of the tunnel and supply and demand should be getting to a better place as we move through the second half of the year end and take thing. David Vernon All right. Thanks very much for the time, guys. Fredrik Eliasson Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Bascome Majors Yes. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just real quickly on the attrition rate, can you guys help quantify that for us whether in percentage terms or the number of people per year? Hunter Harrison I think they were working on some numbers for me and let me clarify something that I'm trying to, we all have kind of dramatically a different type of explanations for, I'm talking about contractors, consultants, employees, all of the above everybody to get the cheque. Okay, I think that I'll correct this if I'm wrong, that the attrition is going to come in at that 9% level range, 8.5% to 9%. And so, if you look at those numbers as opposed to where we are, you use some kind of order or magnitude of what we get absorb without adversely affecting people. Bascome Majors Yes. Thank you for that and Hunter as we take a step back, if you look recently at least, management canters have been based in the short term on operating income in the longer term on a mix of ROA. And as you in the reconstituted board looked at the outcomes you want to drive over the next four years, is there a change to that coming? How do you want to incentivize this in your management team to accomplish what you want to accomplish? Hunter Harrison Well yes, I think that quarterly, look, I am not obsessed for example with the operating ratio. The more I try to get away from it the more people push me back in the middle of it. I mean clearly there's some, there are issues that are return on your name it, capital equity that whatever there are more material ways over a longer timeframe to look. The problem gets to be as we're incorporated into your yearly, daily operation and make the conversion because there is a lag period that you go through. I think a lot of businesses and I think we are a little bit that we have to address is this, we've got our compensation system so complex the employees won’t understand it, I mean you have gone too far but I think that's something that the board talked about this week it happens facing committee discussed it and I think it's something that we want to be sure that we are motivating the right behavior with the employees of return effectively on caption. One of the rules of this model is this, they'll spend $1 in precious capital and so your growth been explore every operating alternative. And so, I think there's going to be a push that way more and more for return numbers than rather than just roll margins on operating ratio. Bascome Majors Into that point, I'm sorry? Fredrik Eliasson But once I get, on the you have talked about the long term being ROA. ROAs half of it and operating ratio has got the other half of it. I just want to make sure you knew both of it. Bascome Majors Appreciate it. Is there a possibility for a free cash flow component, is that something you guys are considering? Hunter Harrison Yes, free cash flow works. I mean, in all of the above, it’s how you weigh those factors, and if you do you do those things in a material manner. Everyone has got some downside too. You focus this year on free cash flow and you make some inventory decision to make some artificial goal which deals you next year. So, it really takes a material approach from management and sometimes that’s hard to put together. Frank Lonegro And certainly a focus on cash is important as you saw in the quarterly financial report we put out last night and the guidance we put out and we're certainly being transparent in terms of free cash flow and how we are calculating it and what the goals are for the year. So that's a new thing for us. Bascome Majors Hunter and Frank, thank you for the color here. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. Jason Seidl Thank you operator. Hunter welcome back. Everyone else hello. Couple of quick things Hunter, looking at intermodal clearly it's an opportunity in the East. In your eyes, what's the most important piece of intermodal and how to get it more profitable for the railroad? Hunter Harrison Well I mean clearly, it's pretty simple formula. Cindy talked about this morning and the longer the train, but here the train, the lower the cost the better we can be in the terminal. And the service factor, that’s how you get to do. Get personal, get the toiler, get the container get it on the train, get it to its destination and get it on the ground and have it available for the customer. And it’s not so much, if you do the job right and this organization has done a pretty good job there. I mean I look at some of our numbers that I am learning and with our domestic business we are like up in the mid or higher 90s which is pretty admirable with pretty demanding customer as they should be demanding. Like UPS, I mean UPS, just all I want you to do is right what we say intermodal if they were to stay under it. You say you are going to be here third morning, x/x, be here. And if you do that, okay, it's not sometimes we make these things too complex and you simply get it to move it, do what you say you are going to do it and be efficient with. Are we looking at some time saving that we can do little bit here and little bit there continually but I think we are going to do fine there, we are going to get even better there but and then we'll at the same time take advantage of this merchandize network. Jason Seidl And Hunter, is the offering is big it needs to be? Does any investment beyond the typical investment that goes and it needs to be made at intermodal? Hunter Harrison Well I mean Fredrik and probably and Frank can speak to that better than I can. I know that, look I know this company is going to be in a much better position from a base stand point that if we see the opportunity we are ready to make whatever investments we need to take advantages of opportunities in the market out there. Frank Lonegro Yes and we talked about it before over the time. In terms of the network itself, we're 95% double stack clear which is a critical as opposed to driving efficiencies. We are opening one new customer in a live space that we felt was needed which is in Pittsburgh in July and we are looking at longer term terminals that we announced in Carolina the CSX terminal we talked about and we are also to Hunter’s point earlier trying to see where their opportunities to leverage existing facilities and have perhaps combined things to create value that way. So, Hunter have been a great supporter in the franchise in what we are trying to do. And the essence of precision railroading is about running a scheduled network at a high level reliability and that is what we have been doing and we are going to do it more so going forward. Jason Seidl All right. I've look at my follow-up. Hunter, let me hear your opinions on CSX the rest of the rail industry pushing towards one-man crews and when do you see that as a viable option? Hunter Harrison I am not a one-man crew advocate. Now, there are special circumstances, there are different issues, I mean clearly if you're switching a race track or you're switching a mine track with one track or something, there's applications that we have today for one person. But today to take a 20,000 ton train on line of road with one person, I don't think it’s good business. Then why I don’t think that and shame on us that we don't have in my view the quality control to do it. So you have got one person on the train and you have a air hose failure or a drill bar or whatever, as the one person going to deal with the delays of the customers the domino effect and all that and then in some of that go hearts, tell me well, we're going to have people in trucks along the ride away with all these materialism and now they'll be dispatched to the train to help the engineer, the one-man crew and as said well it's not one and then it's one point whatever piece, particularly the day with where rail is relative to take the issues and the whole issue commentary obligation. I just don't think that it's something that we're focusing on. If you look at the payload, and people will shudder what I say this, when my peers with labor leaders if you look at the cost of the other person on that train that's has gotten rid of the payload of X, it's relatively drop in the bucket that the value of that person can bring as an additional eyes and ears and you came watch both sides of the train. And just, we've got a lot of things in the ABCs that we need to get better it before we start talking about one-man crew, then I guess before we total with that, we'll have -- we run the electric train with nobody up there with somebody with a reason is somewhere around it. I don’t know having go and get the demand but I had figured out more, so. Jason Seidl All this and I appreciate the thoughts as always. Thank you for your time. Hunter Harrison Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Ben Hartford Thanks for fitting me in. Hunter, I am just curious about your, we've talked a lot about intermodal on the call but curious about your go-to-market perspective on that the focus has been on the operational side and improving service and efficiency for the customers but if you think about being innovative and creative and flexible as you see CSX's IMC partnerships, do you see opportunities to expand into new partnerships with new IMCs or even kind of even kind of go more direct to market on the intermodal side as you think about a marketing strategy. Do you have any perspective on that? Thanks. Hunter Harrison Under certain circumstances I think all work. I think there is a lot of things that we can do intermodaly that for whatever reason they may try before and it's then got away from it, but am a big as it could have be as repricing. One of the things that you have to do in our model which you'll hear a lot about is balance. And when you look at the graph, the intermodal for instance and it's kind of survive more lend and it keeps showing very denied and then it sync down on Sunday, it's just money that's being wasted. And I tried one experiment. When you hear, you listen to the market and you listen and you hear service, service. And so, we say, well we haven’t run three trains on Friday night, so maybe we can discount on Saturday and Sunday to move some of that business from Friday to Saturday and Sunday. And so, we discounted 15% and 20%. Just how many people came Friday? Nobody. Everybody went Saturday and Sunday. So, you start to find out what the real market is out there. So, there is a lot of creative things I can see today, that we are going to have dispatch or sitting there at two o'clock in afternoon selling the slots. Then I get eight slots left that are going to be opened in less and they are going to discount. I see that my personal view is we will see a day where there won't be full contracts as such as we think about. They will be half but there will be shorter even in late and so I think there is a lot of things to do the way we compensate sales people, for example. And lot of things that rail can do that we can't, I mean, will stuck in the mud with that we can be much more creative to supplement this standard and low product. Ben Hartford Thanks for that, best of luck. Hunter Harrison Thanks. Operator  Thank you. Next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Cherilyn Radbourne Thanks very much and congratulations on a strong part of the year. Fredrik, I wonder if you could talk about after margin how you feel that the volume with for 2017 versus how you felt that the time at Q4 call and just what influence that had and the team confidence in providing 2017 guidance this morning. Fredrik Eliasson Sure. I would say that coming out of the I guess election, I am not sure it has anything to do with it but at the end of the year we did see little bit of up take in our volume and our projections through the year. I'm not sure that it's transferred into the macro numbers at this point but we did see a little bit more volume and perhaps who anticipated at the beginning of the year. We obviously also saw a coal market on the export side that improved beyond what we had anticipated originally even though we still expect it to taper off as we moved through the year. So, I would say that there is probably a slight increase in topline projection but it really isn't the foundation for what we did here in terms of the guidance that incremental change. It is the item that what we have done here over the last quarter or so to put ourselves in the position coupled with Hunter's arrival here and his operating model that has allowed us to do this. Cherilyn Radbourne Okay. So, it's more the operational side then. Hunter Harrison Which Cherilyn, gives the flow through obviously to the bottom line. Cherilyn Radbourne Right. And then just a quick one on CapEx, you have adjusted down by about 5% for 2017, can you just talk about what you've already found room to trim there? Frank Lonegro Sure, so you are right. We started out the year with about 1.97 billion in core capital meeting before you get the positive train control. We trimmed little over a 100 million from that number as we gave you the free cash flow numbers for the year. What we really did was we looked at all of the network investments and then to pause some of those given the fact that we are making terminal changes operating plan changes we have higher expectations for service products and so we really got to give that sometime to sync in before we decide exactly where we want to deploy some of that network capital. And then, on some of the return seeking projects to the point Hunter made earlier, we really looked at ways that we can get there through better process, better execution of that process and better accountability etcetera. So, we found some opportunity on both of those category. Cherilyn Radbourne Thank you, that's all from me. Operator Thank you. And next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin Yes, thanks very much and welcome back Hunter. Hunter Harrison Hi, Walt. Walter Spracklin My question is on the free cash flow and how that's going to go into your buyback program leverage. I know you announced $1 billion new program here but I know how you've always liked your buyback. Leverage doesn't seem to be an issue at all and if I don't know if you huddled with Frank here little bit and talked about longer term where you want to see your leverage ratio go to and as a result and with the free cash flow you are going to generate from your initiatives. Could we see a much more expanded buyback in the billion dollar announcement here this morning? Hunter Harrison Well Frank spent a lot of time this week with the board and the finance committee and I have believe it or not got the back up from that discussion and be a little more operating focused and let me let Frank help you there. Frank Lonegro Yes, we had a great discussion this week and obviously you have heard us reiterate the BBB+/Baa1. Today you saw the size of the program for the next 12 months obviously as we get more and more monthly quarters under our belt and we get an understanding of the free cash flow numbers both for coming quarters and coming years. We'll take a hard look at whether or not we are deploying the capital in the correct way to shareholders in the correct amounts and we always look at the balance sheet and try to determine what the appropriate place is given really the cyclicality of the business on the merchandise and intermodal side as well as the capital intent for the business and making sure we preserve the access to the marketplace that we need in tougher time. So, we want to stress test the numbers that we have internally to make sure if there is in fact a holding line or any can see decline that we can stomach that. So, we think we are on pretty good shape with good numbers up for you in the quarter and the forward guidance as well as the buyback and the dividends. So, right now we feel like in pretty shape. Hunter Harrison Yes. Also, I don't think our policy going to be different than what we you have been familiar with, okay. If you look at allocation basal, the first call is going to be always reinvestment in this railroad and hopefully we got opportunities to make the appropriate returns there. If those don’t present their self, then we're going to look at other ways the most efficient ways as Frank described to return that case to the owner, whether it's through buyback, dividend, combinations thereof, will always be a little debated about what your structure is and what kind of fund you are managing and which customers want which. But I think we, I think the board yesterday had our both for two days estimating these and the board meeting, that a third discussion of our policies there and there was a great deal of common understanding in directionally which way we need to go. Walter Spracklin Okay. This is the second question here is on the competitive response to your initiatives both from a service standpoint but also from a operating standpoint as you get lower cost, your ability to more efficiently and higher profitability services for customers. And I am just interested in what the competitive response might be that might cause problems for you Hunter, in terms of what you're trying to achieve. I know you've always had a great view on pricing, the pricing is what the market dictates but often we hear when market share shifts, they want it on price. So, is there a risk that a competitive response might come in and may put problems on how you can effect change or make them a little longer to achieve at the end of the day? Do you have any views on that? Hunter Harrison Yes. Then they ought to be careful. If that's the response, look, as I think it's just pretty simple response. As long as we provide the service we talk about today and we become and we are going to get there the low cost carrier, okay, we got to worry about to tell you. I don't know what they are going to do in the way of response that is smart, is they can do that first. After competitors doing things stupid, that's good. And sometimes it's short term pain but I don't think that I'd see anything out there but this they are going to have some different response than they've had six months ago than what they are going to have in the future that's going to set this organization back. We get an agenda, we have got a wonderful customer base, we are going to see some organic growth. I'm convinced we're going to see some market share growth. I got to be a little patient there but this is going to come together. And I don't think a lot of what takes places is going to be negatively impacted by the competition. Walter Spracklin Is there, there is a view out there that it can be emulated that some of your initiatives can just be copied and the efficiency you achieve can be followed by your competitors or anything you'd respond to that with regards to what you're doing and a unique way you are doing it that will make it more difficult for the competition to copy you? Hunter Harrison Couple of that would. It's on eBay for a $1000, I mean, it's the market, if not then we can't get it recopy that some of the competition used to work for all of those to get copy rights business. It's not secret, okay. It's one thing to write its play book, okay. A lot of companies keep sitting down and give you yes and no, okay. The key is you got to have players that can execute. You don’t have to play, you're going to execute. You steal every play but you all. So, I hope they do copy but if they copy us, I think they might be more efficient and I'll look at other rails generally speaking much more is our partners is our near competitor. Of course, we had so much airline business too here. So, we have that. The secrets in this, I miss them. Walter Spracklin Fair enough, thanks very much. Hunter Harrison Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Scott Schneeberger Thanks, good morning. Hunter, I was curious, just your comment taking two to three days out of the Chicago Jacksonville route, I'm curious what type of time it would take to do such a thing and is that unique because the Chicago should we expect that more broadly then? Hunter Harrison Well, that's I think you expect it broadly. If you look at the overall velocity, I mean, I just used Chicago for an example and how quick can you see it, you can see it overnight. I mean, we are starting to reach schedules at railroad, I know that the main company has gotten especially Florida pretty well reworked and done and that’s been I've been doing some looking, work for towards and on. And so, we're going to kind of go up the line, we will have what you have been used to before with every guy have its own trip plan. One plan, they only get re-tripped and re-tripped, you got one plan, we got to tell the customers going to be 83 hours door-to-door and we're going to do it. And one of the ways to do it is this. Look, I -- we've get a lot of good things going, we got some things, we got to say. Our train speed is not right out of it, our merchandise train speeds between terminals is like 18 miles an hour. We got the potential to be at 27, 28, and you start taking numbers like that and then you avoid terminals and rather than drive into a terminal and dwell for 26 hours you can drive by that one and skip that 26 and pick up a little here and you do the math and don’t take long, you get to Florida two or three days quicker depending on where at large you are going. That's just an order of magnitude that impact both service and cost and asset turns and all of the stuff is good. Scott Schneeberger Great, thanks. And then just some of the -- with regards to this year's operating ratio guidance, what is the one big bucket item that you think could where you could outperform and then maybe a bucket item where you are most nervous where you may underperform? Thanks. Hunter Harrison That's how way late wake at night worry about that in that regard. If something happens that I'm not aware of or there is some geopolitical or something happens in Washington or something like that but I mean this is a pretty simple formula of there something that most of us have been in our whole life and they'll have to do this railroad, and that's how we got to do to get these things accomplished. Now, I mean obviously look, people, when you take a 1000 people as an organization, that's a bit hit. It's a big saving right there. That's a lot of it, but the other thing that you look at, the rail cars, the train starts, the start and the yard starts with the closest to the hub. All those things, those are natural that kind of about working capital will be then go -- we weren’t going to be with the best part for some of these entirely. Retires, and these old up gear, they don’t like them anymore. So, we have moved a lot of profit there but this is going to happen. Scott Schneeberger Great, thanks. Operator  Thanks. Your next question comes from Duran Marabala with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Duran Marabala Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hunter, I guess just one question from me on the revenue side. I am wondering, is there any sort of revenue that you see on the book of business that maybe doesn't meet the return thresholds and maybe needs to be demarcated. I know some of that did happen with CP sort of early on in the process there. Thank you. Hunter Harrison No. Look, there is some odds and ends that just pops every once a while with the individual move or something. Everybody goes through a little bit of that, but generally speaking I mean for instance then maybe they're here to point those kind of things out and obviously if they were there and I was coming, you might have been motivated to get them out of there. You have to and so no we are not going to demark and we're looking at marking. Duran Marabala Thank you, that's helpful. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Justin Long Thanks and good morning. I know it's still early but I was wondering if you could talk about any structural changes to the network that we could see this year as it relates to divestitures of non-core assets and when thinking about that mid-60s OR guidance for 2017, does that include the impact of any real-estate gains? Hunter Harrison The second part, no we don't include any real-estate gain. The real-estate gain is it where they are and that's been discussed internally, are all gravy but I can tell you that the experience in the past, there are lots of opportunity up there, even now in Chicago. And it's a big number in my book and it's something that we will be sensitive to and talk to about. It's not going to drive the business but it certainly going to be in the bucket and the blender when we make certain operating decisions about where we operate from and locate and let me make sure I understood the first part of the question. Justin Long Just asking about the potential for divestitures at some points in this year, maybe some short line assets that you would view as being non-core to the franchise? Hunter Harrison There is not anything. Look, there is a lot of initiatives going on here that I am sure that I am not even aware of yet that but to my knowledge there is nothing of any large metrics that we are looking at what we’ve been both the knowledge just getting better what we do with the franchise that we have. Justin Long Okay. And secondly, Hunter you made the comment earlier that this franchise has more potential than any other you've dealt with. With that in mind do you think there is a path for this business to have industry leading margins or do you think there are structural limitations getting to an OR level that we've recently seen from the Canadian route. Hunter Harrison No, I think you can have the industry leading margins, I think you will have. The only issue there in massive world is if I can get all that done before I have to go, I'd like to be here to cut the ribbon, that's kind of big deal it's just a little personal goal but there is no reason that structurally certain I know knowing that this railroad it can now become the greatest road in north America. If it's greatest in North America, it's probably greatest in the world. And let me just [indiscernible] people look at this. I went to Canada the first time as an American and meant not fun to begin with, but I got there and seeing it just can do with great restructuring coming out of that deal and it's impressive numbers but the one thing they did is a problem, do not expect the Canadian railroad to ever achieve numbers like the US rail, it's just not structurally possible until our operating ratio went to the leading operating ratio in North America. And then just what the US roads did. The US roads did, look we're going to improve but don't think we are ever going to reach the level of the Canadian road, it's just not structurally possible. So, it's got something new with what you're paid for exists and where do you reside, but it's the same vein, that whole board up here does mean that much. Justin Long Okay, great. I appreciate the time and we are all looking forward to watching this play out. Hunter Harrison Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question. Brian Konigsberg Hey, good morning. Thanks for bidding me in and welcome Hunter. And just almost all my questions have been answered. I think an award is deserved for many of the analysts still coming up with stuff this late into the call. But I guess just the one thing just for the model sake, obviously Hunter you've got an employment contract that has been stamped and we're still waiting for the result of the shareholder meeting. We'll expect that to go through most likely. So, how should we be baking in kind of the share grants and additional payment set have been agreed upon so far throughout this year in cash flows and into these share baseline? Hunter Harrison Yes. I'm not sure that it's appropriate for me to address that, let me let Frank address that. Frank Lonegro So, in terms of the share based compensation, obviously we book expense on that one onto the Black-Scholes model and we've done that in terms of the guidance that we've given you. In terms of the shareholder vote, obviously you heard David's opening remarks and we're not going to touch on that one. But the free cash flow number that we gave you for the year is excluding the existing restructuring charges and any subsequent restructuring charges that might happen in the second quarter. Brian Konigsberg And so just presumably the share count could does not reflect any grants at this point but that can certainly change at their shareholder meeting. Is that -- I am just saying the share grants, I presume it's not in the numbers now and likely not in the guidance that was provided but that could change after the shareholder meeting that could be baked in our next discussion if it's approved. Frank Lonegro The numbers we gave you, the around $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow excludes the cash impact of the things that we're discussing both in the first quarter and perhaps things that could happen subsequently in the second quarter. Is that cleared now? Brian Konigsberg Yes. I could follow-up on that offline but that helps. Thank you. Frank Lonegro Okay. Operator Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call over to Hunter Harrison for closing remarks. Hunter Harrison Well, thanks very much for joining us in a very simulating goal. Hopefully, we have answered all your questions. And I got a rental key. So, if you'll excuse me. Thanks. Operator This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Go ahead with your question. Brian Ossenbeck Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Hunter, I guess my first one for you I know with have a scheduled day later in the year perhaps to hear more about the longer-term plan, but the initial impressions that were laid out in the file, could you just give us some context in terms of where do think the significant opportunities are to further streamline the network, you talked about monetizing real estate, which is a target that – any specific when you are there, and just in general if you think there is just too much track with too few [Indiscernible] going over there, just the ability to improve the network density and the design as you move forward over the next couple of years? Hunter Harrison Let me – I don’t think that this franchise is significantly different than others that we have overlaid this model with. Cindy touched on a lot of these things, and as we have talked internally, we don't have some ironclad numbers on what the headcount number got to be, what the pump closures got to be. It is going to be what is smart to do. I don’t think that I have spent a great deal of time with Cindy and her team. We are – I think step one was cutting through a lot of bureaucracy. We are getting through where we had nine-divisions, and so we are going to be going down to maybe a couple. [Indiscernible] just cost money, and I think we are trying to streamline that. We are trying to get the right leadership in the right spot. We have got nine dispatching offices. I don't think any railroad has nine dispatching offices, and we are going to make some efforts there. There is efforts going on now promoting productivity, I would expect before the summer is up, we will have 550 or so locomotives [restored]. We will probably have 25,000 freight cars put up, and all of the associated costs that go with them, labor, material, and the locomotive fuel productivity, velocity, and a lot of things, dwell time in terminals I would say would come down dramatically. Some of our facilities historically have they been overbuilt? Yes.  Like the auto railroad. But this railroad has had a special challenge. If you look back at the mergers, there were more companies involved with mergers of that what is now the CSX than any other major railroad. So if you are going to place [Indiscernible] and we have four or five yards, well, it is because you have money to have a yard there if you go through some of these common points. So, we are doing some things. For example, [Indiscernible] is a good example, where I think we have four yards there. Cindy is helping me here, and I think we will be down to, maybe there is one super operation there. But I know we have a track of land there that is an operating proxy that needs to be a good deal of money. So there is going to be some monetization of assets. So this is going to be more of the same at maybe a more rapid pace taking advantage of larger opportunities. Brian Ossenbeck Okay, great. Thanks Hunter. So, just one quick follow-up just on the coal side, Frank or Fred, if you could just give us a sense is that the export market price and that really spiked pretty much after the quarter ended. So, just want to see if you thought that the mix, the favorable benefit that you saw in the first quarter is something that you would also be able to capture in the second and third quarter? Thank you. Frank Lonegro Well, thank you. We don't forecast size, but we have said overall, over time that we do have indexes on our contracts on the export side that when things go well we share some of those economics, and when things aren’t as well, we take some of that pain. Clearly this quarter, it wasn’t just export pricing that helped. We also see some pretty favorable mix and a lot of that mix we do expect to continue, but it of course, depends on where we see the utility business, for example, go in terms of resale replenishment of the inventories of through the years. So, I think there's a favorable mix story and favorable sort of going forward but I think it's unclear at this point how favorable it's going to be through the year. Brian Ossenbeck Okay, thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. You may ask your question. Chris Wetherbee Hi, great. Thanks, and good morning. Michael Ward Good morning. Chris Wetherbee I want to touch on the volume side, Hunter. If you could just sort of give your initial impressions on what you give sort of volume opportunities that are out there for CSX, obviously playing in the E3 automatically kind of think of the intermodal market and efficiency obviously played big and to being able to gain shareable from truck as well as your rail competitors. Can you give us a sense as what your initial impressions are about sort of the franchise there and how you think about that going forward? Hunter Harrison Well, I'm obviously in 30 days, I've limited amount of knowledge. I will say that I think one of these starting things going forward with this organization as well as rail overall is the opportunity catch before us to get this off the hour. And I think that we're set up in almost a perfect storm here to take advantage of that. If you look at that we have we start with a strong base to begin with, with great market that we serve up and down the East Coast and Chicago, Florida, and some really some growth areas, where there is congestion, the highway systems aren’t going to be able to contemplate everything. If you look at the advantages of rail would, from an environmental standpoint, from an energy standpoint. And if you look at an organization that is going to be able to take a combination of dual times and terminals about limiting terminals, which lowers cost, that at the same time then takes dual times now from an average of effectively a day or 25 hours or 26 hours of dual, down to 18 or so, and you say we're going to skip some terminals and you start to look at really what we used to talk about the strong competitive, that is not strong competitive, it's better than pro. Now, the issue is the change and is tried to take that to the market place and to sell it and converted and change it. But that's where look the individual markets, I mean this can be just as we guess more the competitors out there, we'll stretch and fighting and win the business there. The real opportunity has been is on the in the high wall. Chris Wetherbee Okay, that's very helpful. I appreciate that. And then just a follow-up thinking about some of the guidance and we had to think about it a little bit beyond 2017. So, mid-60s for this year, we're having pull forward some of the benefit, but clearly some of the things you are going to be doing are going to be gaining traction as the year progresses. Presumably you'll be entering 2018 at a better run rate. So, obviously I'm trying to jump the gun here a little bit and get some of this forward. Look, before you might be ready to give it but when you think about 2018, and I think you got it wrong in the respect that it is sort of natural that some of the benefits you're acquiring in 2017 will be playing out in 2018 and maybe we're thinking about something like the low 60s or show a warn in 2018? Hunter Harrison Is that based -- send me your mail, Chris, and I'll fill it in. I think you're right on. Look, this is not the first time this movie played out. We see opportunities, not going to happen overnight. Is it going to exactly linear? No. will be there be a fair step approach? Yes. Do we have any barriers here? Structural issues, as we deal with the board discuss, we can't do what's been done before. And even go beyond that? No reason. Chris Wetherbee Got you, that makes sense. Thanks very much, it's worth the shot. I appreciate it. Hunter Harrison Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. You may ask your question. Tom Wadewitz Yes, good morning. Hunter Harrison Good morning, Tom. Tom Wadewitz Hunter, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on the opportunity at CSX versus what you saw at CP. I think of your approach being one of the things you do is simplify the flow of traffic and reduce work event. If CSX has a greater complexity and the network begin with versus CP, that would have find maybe greater opportunity for cost take out in or as you take out that, that complexity right simplify things. So, that's the right framework and I wanted to see if you could comment on that and maybe compare the opportunity you see so far at CSX versus what you had at CP. Hunter Harrison Well, I mean, Tom, they're totally different franchises. The maker, the market. As generally speaking, a lot of roads are in North America. So, you look behind your belt and you say look what is the best way to operate and run this franchise and I think that the -- there is a lot of talk about this is not a simple T operation that it got all the complexities and the density and the spaghetti bowls. Well, the waiting, the hand led, eat his spaghetti and get rid of it. So, one of the things we've done, is the same the time we work diligently on is being sure that we're not going through terminals and process and cars just because the terminals there. So, it's almost kind of the old term we use before the wide motocross, let's start on with this franchise. The last, and I was there yesterday when I talked to group but the last stop yard, it was built in North America, the last two, with one and way across which is the heart of this CSX in my view. And the other one was our [indiscernible] in mid-80s. Markets have changed since mid-80s. Demand of traffic that's bulk, that is intermodal, that is very nearly -- true trends. It don’t have to be sold it in Swiss, so you adopt that year your operating strategies to the market. And I just think that there's much more of a natural fit to make some of the changes that we need to make here that will present even more opportunities to both year point for the complexity as said in the past and built in and simplified. This franchise, if you apply the marker here to some degree, adds more potential than anyone up there will. Tom Wadewitz Okay, great, that's helpful, I appreciate it. Then the second question of the follow-up would be, CSX approached intermodal has benefit different than I think what typical if you look at Norfolk, they have the corridor strategy. I think that will be more characteristic maybe of the Canadian road. But CSX has this Baltimore Ohio hub strategy, and has talked about one in the South East. Do you think that is the right approach to continue or do you think on the intermodal network is their opportunity to maybe simplify and go towards more of a kind of a origin to destination as opposed to sending it to the hub that you have in Baltimore Ohio? Thank you. Hunter Harrison Well, Tom, I don’t want to get into about there. I'm sure the people here they’ve have potentially a different better strategy given what they had to work with. The operating groups challenge is to present velocity and speed in customer requirements to the marketing sales group and then given how well that service going to apply to the market, then its spreads changed job into this end of service to take that to the market. And I think a better product raw product this Wendy and team can produce the more successful and more latitude, it will give thread and technique till I think that I think the competition, we're going to get bears in our rear view mirror and they're going to be looking at the rear, we're going to be pass him on the left. Tom Wadewitz Okay, great. Thank you for the time, Hunter, I appreciate it. Hunter Harrison Yes. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question. Allison Landry Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Hunter, Chicago has always been at the forefront of your mind and historically you've made comments that CSX used the Chicago belt and perhaps the Indiana belt for switching more than any of the other rail. So, now that you're in arguably a much better see to effects change. Do you have any plan to pick Chicago and if so could you provide some content surrounding that? Hunter Harrison I don’t know that how quick to pick Chicago. But Chicago is a special issue. And if you noticed in a lot of our what we've discussed and talked about, it hadn’t included Chicago, but those Chicago we here affectively carved out and are taking a different special type look at. Chicago has some real challenges to this all North American infrastructure. Chicago cannot survive as it is today. You got law suits now, the imminent domain, had you want to take rail infrastructure to replace it with that one. You got it right beside all here. Okay. Everybody wants to grow, they want to grow in Chicago and it's not going to work. Now, the plus for us is this. We own a lot of assets in Chicago and we can be a more significant player that in positions that been in the past. And only one move could change things in Chicago and so people have to be aware of it and not I don’t read, I'm not going to mention the term but just a stroke of a pen of a partnership could shift a lot of track away from Chicago, and infrastructure thing to people think it's need for Chicago will be needed. For example, if you look at Kansas City today. Kansas City used to be a Chicago. And we were little late in the real business and built tons of infrastructure and now you look at Kansas City and it's pretty much rail business relative to the infrastructure. So, Chicago is going to be gravy on top of this plan of what we eventually decide we're able to do with our partners and fellow owners and all the other entities that want to be part of Chicago. So, it’s real opportunity is that we're taking a special look at. Allison Landry Okay. And when you refer to the stroke of a pen of a partnership, is that a single partnership that you have in mind or could it be multiple? Hunter Harrison Look, I don’t have anything in mind. I got four years contract, I want to go out and CSX with a green, with a blue and gold jersey running under the goal post, okay. If even if I want to do something after that, it's up to them. I'm only pointing out that one of the challenges that's brought to my attention, almost every time, I'd be with the big customer, is real consolidation. And in spite of the fact that which you might hear, in proper statement, we got to LA to a customer in South and West of adding service to New York and I'll talk to you about half of it. They don’t want to hear about half of it, they want to hear about all of it. And until one easy and control movement rail is never going to have the competitive alternative to the highway. But what I'm just pointing out that for a lot of these reasons, Chicago was kind of a wild card. Allison Landry Okay. And then, as a follow-up question, how are you thinking about the coal network or other areas of the network that doesn't necessarily have as much density as you would like. And I know there was sort of a question earlier in this round. But ask a little bit differently, is there any opportunity to short line any of this business and are there any carriers or holding companies that you think would be a good fit? Hunter Harrison Now, look I think that -- I think that you give us off to and buy into, what we say we're going to do, that you don’t need to think about short liners all the time. I do think that we do domestically move coal a little bit different than I'm traditionally used to, in a very disciplined close loop unit train operation that can be much more efficient. You can't move unit train coal train for three days and then park them two days and then run them for three days and then move again to very efficiently. Now if you do that there is a higher pulse associated with it with higher cost maybe comes the higher price. So what we are trying to do both with the -- is to create and encourage our super stores with us to create more disciplined approach what we can do with [indiscernible] and fewer locomotives and we can be more competitive for them and give them a constant supply of coal which is what they want and if we developed the reliability we need then it will all come together. Allison Landry Okay. Excellent. Thank you for the time.  Operator Thanks. The next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question, Amit Mehrotra Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the operating expectations for this year. It looks like the OR target of the mid 60s implies around 800 million year-over-year on your profit improvement. It just seems by our estimate at least that only about 300 million of that will come from revenue growth and improved fixed cost absorption which leaves about call it somewhere close to half a billion dollars of absolute reduction in the cost base. So first of all is that the type of cost take out that you hunter in the team and are targeting to realize this year and just for our own, my own avocation, how does one achieve sort of half a billion dollar of cost take out without maybe driving a significant amount of disruption at least in the near term. Thank you. Frank Lonegro Amit, let me, it's Frank, let me take that one first and then turn it over to Hunter for additional commentary. In the targets that we gave you one of the things that we mentioned was record productivity embedded within that is obviously the prior record of $427 million in 2016 so clearly you can have your own estimate in terms of how much we will exceed that to a very good start in terms of the $123 million of efficiency. I think from just a line item perspective other than fuel you should expect us to continue to drive cost out across the board in terms of the various items there when you look at better service you look better productivity, you look at the ability to absorb volume with literally no additional cost associated with that, you get huge flow through from what your expectations are on the revenue side. So we are kicking one off cylinders here in terms of the volume side, the pricing side and the efficiency side so that's what gave us the confidence to put out the targets that we did this morning. Michael Ward Yes, I mean I don't want to add more example that which you want to look at odd numbers just the achieve it. Taking on some initiative to take the 1000 position, those 1000 positions were a lot of more voluntary and there was store room that is what we are all position that has not touch any of the [inaudible] we are going to utilize the people internally we have, we are very sensitive to your comment about the disruption and the moral and we have at [inaudible] but it is a little higher when normal and so I think if you had the [inaudible] member on it and I haven’t got into that kind of level yet but I think the potential is there that sometime around the first half of the year by the end of, there would be probably be a similar number taken out also now we didn’t take any of those to take some real cost without impacting the service or safety or anything else. These are just a different ways to doing things. We are bringing some job own. We have, I don’t know all of that, 250 or 300 boys in India, we are reviewing those jobs back here but [inaudible] also some job but I am really [inaudible] worried about India right now I am worried about CSX [inaudible] America, so there is a lot of opportunity and I don’t think that there was a breach as far as we do the job and we have the ability to do that we can achieve all these things that we dealt that. Frank Lonegro Okay, one other point on the folks in India, there are contractors not employees but obviously we're going to in source that work and really look to absorb that with the existing workforce. I know Cindy also had some points, she wanted to make here. Cindy Sanborn I just put it in a couple of broad categories as I think about it. [inaudible] mentioned the reduction in the management that took place last month, I think as you think about [inaudible] conversions and so forth those types of actions I would call core operations and we expect to do more of that. Volume absorption, we are seeing our outlook with a higher level of volume for us to move and we think we can absorb that of more efficiently than putting resources back one for one and then I would also say, some of the, looking back and some of the improvements that we have made other railroads [inaudible] I would call it network efficiency cars online velocity [inaudible] those types of things, we think will see improvement improvements there. So I would call that just network efficiencies going forward. And when you put all that together that's what's given us our confidence to move forward with that with another record here. Amit Mehrotra Right. Well thanks for all that. Let me just ask one follow up if I could. Frank, on your comments about productivity, maybe I'm thinking about incorrectly but I feel like productivity is different than absolute reduction in the cost structure? Because productivity is in my view the way I understand it you're optimizing the cost structure to maximize the incremental, may be minimized to detrimental but it doesn't necessarily mean the cost structure is declining. So you guys achieved 72% incremental operating margin in the quarter which is unbelievably great. Is there a way to understand or help us in terms of what was that was actually fix cost absorption? What was that actually absolute reduction the cost structure? Frank Lonegro So, when we think about productivity and how, I would say keep score internally, we do look for structural cost reductions. So a big part of that record productivity, structural cost reductions meaning each line item in the expenses is going to get lower again I'm excluding fuel just given the price environment that we're in but we are focused on fuel efficiency as well. I think there as you can see from an incremental margin perspective, we're also a very good start with about 72% incremental for the first quarter when you understand what we're trying to do on the cost side and you will understand what the volume outlook looks like I would estimate that the incremental margins were actually improve throughout the year which is going to give you the bottom line to flow through the revenue that we are bringing up. Amit Mehrotra That's great. Hunter, one last one for me if I could. Can you just comment on your relationship with the union so far? You have the company has over 20,000 union employees, can you just talk about those initial meetings and conversations and just in the context of all the operational changes to come? That’s it for me. Thank you. Hunter Harrison Well, I hope it's pretty good. I've worked most of my career. The first four years alongside of the various roles that now make up the effects and those some of the leadership I've had some, I mean terrible what I say here, I had some bad things conversations, exploring new opportunities with those individuals. It's not real common for a new CEO to get me in and I don't care what your name is in the labor leaders to be bringing in a [inaudible] that just now, [inaudible] but at the same time I [inaudible] to be approached unofficially at least, the conversations about potentially there was something like an hourly agreements that has been extended in some part of the US system and now the Canadian national that we developed. It is very encouraging to say that, even that there are dialogue like that and one of the things that, the beauty of that would be, a couple of things that the people should think that one: those agreements guarantee people position that’s important today people they certainly have job and they have the job guarantee and that’s very important in people and at the same time for us it lowers our, potentially our cost, 30% to 35%. So we're going to have some squabbles. They don't like to see their people disrupted nor do I but you got to do which you got to do some time. And so there'll be some, I'm sure there'll be some, comment but all I care about is the bottom line and profit and I hope that in turn we're very sensitive to the employees in the part they play in this. So I think we'll do fine with it. Amit Mehrotra Okay. Thank you for answering my questions, I appreciate it. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question. Ravi Shankar Thanks. Good morning everyone. Hunter, just to summarize tie-up everything you said in the call so far in terms of playbook the precision railroading playbook that you've so effectively deployed several times before at other railroads, do you think that's kind of directly applicable to CSX here or do you think the complexity of the network here involves changes to the way that it's been under before and also CSX has in recent years had a playbook of deemphasizing coal and becoming more of an intermodal rail. Do you agree with that and do you think that kind of becomes part of your playbook as well. Hunter Harrison Well, the question was, yes it was. I think, is the more complexity there in the network the better model you can apply to it, you can get more advantages or opportunity but if you just got a linear street line railroad because there would be lot of people can do that into the model to that. So this has certainly, those implications. Now, strategically going down there in the line as to far as, look I think, if you look at three years out of five years, out of ten years that we need to understand that the world is going to continue to change though and we need to be flexible and to have a plan that allows us to change with those changes, okay. And we got things going on as we speak from energy standpoint, what is the future of fossil fuel, what is the future of crude, how much influence of the environment is going to have? What is the next we are going to do with the railroad, you go ahead inject rail, you drive manage huge warehouse of Amazon and so the supply chain is going to change and we have to be, going to be some of the game that are traditional [inaudible] we have to be more flexible and more creative to be able to deal with those changes in the world. Frank Lonegro I mean we have to emphasized call CSX, the coal has been the emphasize by the utility and so we want as much business as we can what is called, but we will deploy our strategy where we can capture the growth and create the bottom line value for CSX through excellent service to our customers. Ravi Shankar Got it and your vision of your intermodal, is this largely, I think you spoke about service initiatives a little earlier on the call, but it is largely a case of improving the service levels and gain to a point where it become super-competitive versus struck or are you looking for more demand improvement from macro or kind of being able to take price and segments. So between service and demand and price kind of which do you think is the most important level for intermodal?  Hunter Harrison I don’t know that, the market would have you believe, to begin with, we are not going to sit here and let our precious service the kind of commodity and so that there we create in service and I would [inaudible] at this we are just in time an intermodal get real hot, if you look back and do a little history, you will see that prior I am in, it was not going to our 20% [inaudible] you let interest rate and they are going back up after, I just can’t tell you when they do people do move merchandize will be rewarded because caring are going to go up. The beauty is this the quicker we move it, the cheaper it is and so it goes on itself and so we turn the equipment quicker, we give better service to the customer and we got the lower cost and then we can may more convincing and it all fits in this model. Ravi Shankar Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question. Ken Hoexter Good morning. Hunter, you sound well I look forward to your tenure at CSX. If you noted you're going to be an advocate for customers in your intro remarks. Is that a change in how you're going to attack the plan? I mean after you've left obviously we heard keep talk about fixing ruffled feathers and a customer focus. So now it sounds like you start this with a little bit of a different tact. Maybe you can just talk about that a bit. Hunter Harrison I have in my whole career in fact one of the reasons why I'm sitting here was I have to be an operating guys that [inaudible] okay. I have got a little reputation [inaudible] people look at your bill and that wouldn't they do on the ground, but look there's no one more sensitive than I am and more [inaudible] than I am of the business that our customers yield, okay. I am the greatest advocate in the world which you could sit in some of our meetings when we talk about service and we talk about [inaudible] because that’s not just about creating pain and suffering for our customers which I don’t want to see creating. One example of a customer turn over a period just when we are going to do a transition that sense any problem or issue from it didn’t exist, okay. So I am going to do a little coaching couple of mine and actually anticipate had a response. Ken Hoexter Let me just read it, something you talked about on the union because the US has changed like historically have been a little bit different right in terms of all the rails coming to negotiating in one team against kind of the all the unions in one group. You always had things may be a little bit differently in Canada, can you, is that something you think you need to shift how you would address that as you move forward? Hunter Harrison Well, I think, if you look back, the parts when I was parts of the U.S. operation, we were not part of handling. So negotiated our labor agreement and then we can do that now we are going to have some dialog it appears to me and I have had a chance to some of my colleague about it but it appears to me that some of the big -- if you will or seven or they start to see the world differently than if they start to see the world differently and then on one page and that's makes a lot of sense to have this one big care conference negotiated for us. I would much prefer I think us to sit down with our employees and do what's the best for the organization and employee. So I think that all those things that deal with policies and all we will take a look at it and see how they see the world and how we see going forward and what's the most appropriate action. Operator Thanks. Your next questions comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. You may ask your question. Brandon Oglenski Yes good morning and thanks for taking my question and Hunter definitely welcome back and I know there is a lot of investors excited to see you back in the field. So surprisingly though it just keeps coming back we hear it a lot that length of farm, and the short length of farm from the east coast just means that the return on invested capital or the margin potential is not as high as railroads or some of the stuff going out, out west in the US can you just talk to that dynamic and whether or not you think length of plays a lot of determination in the ultimate profitability of the network. Hunter Harrison Well [indiscernible] the markets of the market. We don't get a chance to make the market. I know this the more productive we are the better we are at cost controlling that cut inflation -- controlling cost okay will put us in the position that says people used to say -- 800 miles plus you could make -- well that's not true. If you are operating -- 90s it's true. The operating ratio is 58 it's wrong. So it's I don't really, necessarily while on the short it's the bottom-line margin that we can make out the business and what I don't think we set the price out there. The market sets the price which we want to play or not. And we keep ourselves competitive with the market both with long and short term. Brandon Oglenski And if I could, kind of also that question maybe what Ken was asking well there is some fear that as you go through these operations changes and focus more on service that maybe some of your customers are disruptive from the way business is done in the past is there potential here that you see some share shift as you go through this transition period or do you think as service improve you could actually improve top line at the same time. Hunter Harrison Yes. That's the story. That's why you provide good service. It starts with your product but you don't have the product you don't have anything. So we start with the product and the better we make that product the more we can extract in value added both in market share and whatever the revenue. So this is not one set of the game. It's the revenue up and cost down and investor get rewarded and it's fun. Okay. Brandon Oglenski We look forward to Hunter. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may ask your question. Scott Group Hey thanks. Good morning everyone. So maybe Fredrik can you isolate the strength and export pricing from the mix benefit of losing the short haul business and understand what bigger impact in the quarter and can you just kind of confirm it if the guidance for the year assumes kind of export pricing stays where it is or that it does come down in the back half of the year and then bigger picture on call maybe for you Hunter, we can see this quarter how profitable the coal franchise is if we kind of assume that coal resumes at secured in the next couple of years do you think that maybe could impact the ability to get to us sub 60 OR in a couple of years? Fredrik Eliasson So let me take your first part of your question first. I would say that the majority of the [indiscernible] change was stable mix, with favorable mix on one hand that some of that short haul traffic obviously went away which was short in marginal but also we saw a more replenishment of utilities in the south versus last year where if you recall not for gas prices were tremendously low for design and then also on the export side we saw additional traffic going into the Virginia which is generally little bit of a export there that is longer length of haul so we had a couple of things that was favorable from a mix perspective that certainly helped so that was the majority of the driver that we saw. And then turning to question about the coal franchise to Hunter. Hunter Harrison My numbers, my analysis as a short timer don't include some big goal, if coal comes back stronger than anticipated it's very – will it change any of these numbers, I don't think so. If you look at the last story we get the same thing -- and you will get to the numbers well I think that group has done an excellent job and they continue to do it I think they bound through 60 it through with their life 58 so no I don't think that I have set longer term almost – western Canada that I can't retract it. I just take longer term coal is not something that rails should depend on. Now it can take a while to transition out it's not going to happen overnight and we might see another 10-15 years but longer term I don't think that fuel I mean coal is going to be the energy source of the future. Scott Group Okay and just the part about coal pricing assumed in the guidance in the back half. Hunter Harrison Well overall, side that we follow in this index after the variety of them and as you can see in the forward curve currently that is coming down as we move through second half of the year and that certainly then our expectations as well but we will ultimately see where the market ends up. Scott Group Okay. Thanks and then Hunter since this is your first call, there is couple of things that I want to address. There is some people that presume that ultimately M&A is part of the strategy and maybe you can talk about that and then also in some of your past, you have brought some people on in terms of the team should we be expecting something similar here? Hunter Harrison Well look I don't know what I can say but I would emphasize, okay M&A has nothing to do with this strategy here at all okay. And one thing I take very proud and the integrity okay I am telling you there is no such plan. Even I don't have hands I have got four years it's not going to happen in 10 years [indiscernible] is a lot to play with the hand and bill okay and we got a good hand here. Now do we have a couple of midst, maybe but we are looking internally in fact that was last night talking about some people. I am not sure that we have – that we have taken advantage of all the internal talents that we have here. But if we hint avoid that we have that we need then we can – we always have the ability to go externally. If there anybody wants to get the work force the list is long and we don't have any restrictions about who can leave and can't go here, they can't go there. We are okay, work here they can leave. Okay. In fact if they want to go some other railroad let them go. But we have got we will not have a short of talent and resources to be on the railroad that we described. Scott Group Okay. Thank you. Operator And your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Aegis Capital. Your line is open. Go ahead and ask your question. Jeff Kauffman Thank you very much. Welcome back, good to have you back on. My questions have been asked six ways to Sunday how CCX differs from some other rails you have been at but what I would like to know is at CP there needed to be a capital investment and sighting and some other portions of the rail to achieve the things you wanted to achieve. CN it was different investment can you talk a little bit not so much about multiple yards because we have been built through acquisition but talk about the capital plan at CCX and is there investment that needs to occur for what you need to do and kind of how we think about that strategically. Michael Ward Well. Overall just to look at it without starting to break it down, I think it's clear to me that the capital investment will come down overtime. It has been a good deal since the last few years about -- if you take a look at just what's been spent the last few years on locomotives you would say we are not going to have to do that for a while if we get 550-600 locomotives stored and I can know one of our previous experiences there that we count as numbers and we said well maybe we can take couple of year holiday for locomotives and we did and I think fifth year holiday. So well, we don't have to spend anything on locomotives generally for four, five years clearly a lot of the replacements that were issued with the yards are not there clearly if we have sighting that are too short for the longer train we are certainly not going to leave those sit on the ground and not being utilized so we will pick up 165 [indiscernible] railroad included with the another 6500 and that will we got 13000 and the only thing we capitalized is in the labor we don't have to capitalize the rail and so there is some ways save capital and another issue of overlook is this the better productivity you have with capital the more you can put in. the higher productive you are good in lower with 100 miles main productive stuff is the productivity factor -- but I think my numbers were that over three or four year period we can see 500-600 million reduction in the capital spend and then there are points where you will potentially trend back up and if we don't have something else like coming along to help with our capital spend and I am not big of some percent of revenue we should work that that way and out whatever is the revenue is but I think overall to answer your question there will be some positive for free cash flow out of the reduction in capital. Jeff Kauffman Okay. Well Hunter thank you for your answer and best of luck to you all at CCX. Thank you. Michael Ward Thanks Jeff .  Operator  Thank you. Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein. You may ask your question.  David Vernon Hey good morning. Hunter maybe just a quick question for you on the presence of the share asset areas the old legacy of acquisition is that sort of joint operations in some of the bigger eastern metros create any challenges or opportunities for you when you think about railroad model into the CFX? Michael Ward Well I don't have to, I have not spent in my first company days a lot of time in that area and I'm limited on my knowledge there and I don’t want to try to mess you with the stories that I've heard a lot of best of. Cindy, you got any comments there? Cindy Sanborn Yes David, I think we are always looking for efficiencies where we hand off car whether to the joint facility and then this car rail or IHP in Chicago and there's nothing that really jumps off the page but as we've said many, many times everything's on the table and if we can find opportunities, we will certainly take advantage of them. David Vernon But do you think there are any sort of constraints because you're tied to a schedule that maybe the Conrail serving for, that means both your and the Norfolk needs and it's harder to change or is that something that's probably not an issue? Cindy Sanborn That's really not an issue. It's in all of our best interest to serve our customer better and they just simply supply the last mile service and do a very good job of it and we work very closely together on making sure that the efficient and effective for customers. David Vernon Okay. And Fredrik, may be just as a quick follow-up, when you look at same store sales pricing, I hear your comments on mix in coal and I think what I've heard is where we should expect that to continue to happen but I think in the intermodal merchandise the deceleration in the core price, is that something that we should also expect to kind of happen here or we starting to see some signs of improvement in that domestic intermodal market that would help kind of assure that number? Fredrik Eliasson Well, this is just to clarify also and I am not sure that will really go to a question. The mix was obviously out of the same store sale number, which is why we are doing it. In fact, once again we don't forecast price but I think it's clear that we've been in a place over the last few years where there's been a fair amount of exits capacity in the marketplace and all our customers as Hunter alluded before have alternatives, so we have got a price-to-market. The key thing is, is I look forward now between what I think you guys write a lot about which is that there's a structural change coming and closing an attractable market with some of the ELD limitations and the shortage of drivers and hopefully getting to better placement and capacity perspective. And coupled that, what we're doing with this operating model where I already see a significantly improved service. I think there's an opportunity as we move into '18 to really capitalize on that. So we feel good about where we are, we've priced the market each and every day and as we move forward we will do the same. David Vernon But many as everything I worry are right now are we starting to see things kind of improve sequentially or we're still kind of in a soft patch on the domestic market? Fredrik Eliasson I see some opportunities on the stock market side I follow closely where things seems to be moving in the right direction. I do think that obviously if you see some of the -- and you thought this more than I do on the trucking side as there has been some challenges out there but I see that the light is coming close at the end of the tunnel and supply and demand should be getting to a better place as we move through the second half of the year end and take thing. David Vernon All right. Thanks very much for the time, guys. Fredrik Eliasson Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna Financial Group. Your line is open. You may ask your question. Bascome Majors Yes. Thanks for fitting me in here. Just real quickly on the attrition rate, can you guys help quantify that for us whether in percentage terms or the number of people per year? Hunter Harrison I think they were working on some numbers for me and let me clarify something that I'm trying to, we all have kind of dramatically a different type of explanations for, I'm talking about contractors, consultants, employees, all of the above everybody to get the cheque. Okay, I think that I'll correct this if I'm wrong, that the attrition is going to come in at that 9% level range, 8.5% to 9%. And so, if you look at those numbers as opposed to where we are, you use some kind of order or magnitude of what we get absorb without adversely affecting people. Bascome Majors Yes. Thank you for that and Hunter as we take a step back, if you look recently at least, management canters have been based in the short term on operating income in the longer term on a mix of ROA. And as you in the reconstituted board looked at the outcomes you want to drive over the next four years, is there a change to that coming? How do you want to incentivize this in your management team to accomplish what you want to accomplish? Hunter Harrison Well yes, I think that quarterly, look, I am not obsessed for example with the operating ratio. The more I try to get away from it the more people push me back in the middle of it. I mean clearly there's some, there are issues that are return on your name it, capital equity that whatever there are more material ways over a longer timeframe to look. The problem gets to be as we're incorporated into your yearly, daily operation and make the conversion because there is a lag period that you go through. I think a lot of businesses and I think we are a little bit that we have to address is this, we've got our compensation system so complex the employees won’t understand it, I mean you have gone too far but I think that's something that the board talked about this week it happens facing committee discussed it and I think it's something that we want to be sure that we are motivating the right behavior with the employees of return effectively on caption. One of the rules of this model is this, they'll spend $1 in precious capital and so your growth been explore every operating alternative. And so, I think there's going to be a push that way more and more for return numbers than rather than just roll margins on operating ratio. Bascome Majors Into that point, I'm sorry? Fredrik Eliasson But once I get, on the you have talked about the long term being ROA. ROAs half of it and operating ratio has got the other half of it. I just want to make sure you knew both of it. Bascome Majors Appreciate it. Is there a possibility for a free cash flow component, is that something you guys are considering? Hunter Harrison Yes, free cash flow works. I mean, in all of the above, it’s how you weigh those factors, and if you do you do those things in a material manner. Everyone has got some downside too. You focus this year on free cash flow and you make some inventory decision to make some artificial goal which deals you next year. So, it really takes a material approach from management and sometimes that’s hard to put together. Frank Lonegro And certainly a focus on cash is important as you saw in the quarterly financial report we put out last night and the guidance we put out and we're certainly being transparent in terms of free cash flow and how we are calculating it and what the goals are for the year. So that's a new thing for us. Bascome Majors Hunter and Frank, thank you for the color here. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Seidl with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question. Jason Seidl Thank you operator. Hunter welcome back. Everyone else hello. Couple of quick things Hunter, looking at intermodal clearly it's an opportunity in the East. In your eyes, what's the most important piece of intermodal and how to get it more profitable for the railroad? Hunter Harrison Well I mean clearly, it's pretty simple formula. Cindy talked about this morning and the longer the train, but here the train, the lower the cost the better we can be in the terminal. And the service factor, that’s how you get to do. Get personal, get the toiler, get the container get it on the train, get it to its destination and get it on the ground and have it available for the customer. And it’s not so much, if you do the job right and this organization has done a pretty good job there. I mean I look at some of our numbers that I am learning and with our domestic business we are like up in the mid or higher 90s which is pretty admirable with pretty demanding customer as they should be demanding. Like UPS, I mean UPS, just all I want you to do is right what we say intermodal if they were to stay under it. You say you are going to be here third morning, x/x, be here. And if you do that, okay, it's not sometimes we make these things too complex and you simply get it to move it, do what you say you are going to do it and be efficient with. Are we looking at some time saving that we can do little bit here and little bit there continually but I think we are going to do fine there, we are going to get even better there but and then we'll at the same time take advantage of this merchandize network. Jason Seidl And Hunter, is the offering is big it needs to be? Does any investment beyond the typical investment that goes and it needs to be made at intermodal? Hunter Harrison Well I mean Fredrik and probably and Frank can speak to that better than I can. I know that, look I know this company is going to be in a much better position from a base stand point that if we see the opportunity we are ready to make whatever investments we need to take advantages of opportunities in the market out there. Frank Lonegro Yes and we talked about it before over the time. In terms of the network itself, we're 95% double stack clear which is a critical as opposed to driving efficiencies. We are opening one new customer in a live space that we felt was needed which is in Pittsburgh in July and we are looking at longer term terminals that we announced in Carolina the CSX terminal we talked about and we are also to Hunter’s point earlier trying to see where their opportunities to leverage existing facilities and have perhaps combined things to create value that way. So, Hunter have been a great supporter in the franchise in what we are trying to do. And the essence of precision railroading is about running a scheduled network at a high level reliability and that is what we have been doing and we are going to do it more so going forward. Jason Seidl All right. I've look at my follow-up. Hunter, let me hear your opinions on CSX the rest of the rail industry pushing towards one-man crews and when do you see that as a viable option? Hunter Harrison I am not a one-man crew advocate. Now, there are special circumstances, there are different issues, I mean clearly if you're switching a race track or you're switching a mine track with one track or something, there's applications that we have today for one person. But today to take a 20,000 ton train on line of road with one person, I don't think it’s good business. Then why I don’t think that and shame on us that we don't have in my view the quality control to do it. So you have got one person on the train and you have a air hose failure or a drill bar or whatever, as the one person going to deal with the delays of the customers the domino effect and all that and then in some of that go hearts, tell me well, we're going to have people in trucks along the ride away with all these materialism and now they'll be dispatched to the train to help the engineer, the one-man crew and as said well it's not one and then it's one point whatever piece, particularly the day with where rail is relative to take the issues and the whole issue commentary obligation. I just don't think that it's something that we're focusing on. If you look at the payload, and people will shudder what I say this, when my peers with labor leaders if you look at the cost of the other person on that train that's has gotten rid of the payload of X, it's relatively drop in the bucket that the value of that person can bring as an additional eyes and ears and you came watch both sides of the train. And just, we've got a lot of things in the ABCs that we need to get better it before we start talking about one-man crew, then I guess before we total with that, we'll have -- we run the electric train with nobody up there with somebody with a reason is somewhere around it. I don’t know having go and get the demand but I had figured out more, so. Jason Seidl All this and I appreciate the thoughts as always. Thank you for your time. Hunter Harrison Okay. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Baird. You may ask your question. Ben Hartford Thanks for fitting me in. Hunter, I am just curious about your, we've talked a lot about intermodal on the call but curious about your go-to-market perspective on that the focus has been on the operational side and improving service and efficiency for the customers but if you think about being innovative and creative and flexible as you see CSX's IMC partnerships, do you see opportunities to expand into new partnerships with new IMCs or even kind of even kind of go more direct to market on the intermodal side as you think about a marketing strategy. Do you have any perspective on that? Thanks. Hunter Harrison Under certain circumstances I think all work. I think there is a lot of things that we can do intermodaly that for whatever reason they may try before and it's then got away from it, but am a big as it could have be as repricing. One of the things that you have to do in our model which you'll hear a lot about is balance. And when you look at the graph, the intermodal for instance and it's kind of survive more lend and it keeps showing very denied and then it sync down on Sunday, it's just money that's being wasted. And I tried one experiment. When you hear, you listen to the market and you listen and you hear service, service. And so, we say, well we haven’t run three trains on Friday night, so maybe we can discount on Saturday and Sunday to move some of that business from Friday to Saturday and Sunday. And so, we discounted 15% and 20%. Just how many people came Friday? Nobody. Everybody went Saturday and Sunday. So, you start to find out what the real market is out there. So, there is a lot of creative things I can see today, that we are going to have dispatch or sitting there at two o'clock in afternoon selling the slots. Then I get eight slots left that are going to be opened in less and they are going to discount. I see that my personal view is we will see a day where there won't be full contracts as such as we think about. They will be half but there will be shorter even in late and so I think there is a lot of things to do the way we compensate sales people, for example. And lot of things that rail can do that we can't, I mean, will stuck in the mud with that we can be much more creative to supplement this standard and low product. Ben Hartford Thanks for that, best of luck. Hunter Harrison Thanks. Operator  Thank you. Next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Cherilyn Radbourne Thanks very much and congratulations on a strong part of the year. Fredrik, I wonder if you could talk about after margin how you feel that the volume with for 2017 versus how you felt that the time at Q4 call and just what influence that had and the team confidence in providing 2017 guidance this morning. Fredrik Eliasson Sure. I would say that coming out of the I guess election, I am not sure it has anything to do with it but at the end of the year we did see little bit of up take in our volume and our projections through the year. I'm not sure that it's transferred into the macro numbers at this point but we did see a little bit more volume and perhaps who anticipated at the beginning of the year. We obviously also saw a coal market on the export side that improved beyond what we had anticipated originally even though we still expect it to taper off as we moved through the year. So, I would say that there is probably a slight increase in topline projection but it really isn't the foundation for what we did here in terms of the guidance that incremental change. It is the item that what we have done here over the last quarter or so to put ourselves in the position coupled with Hunter's arrival here and his operating model that has allowed us to do this. Cherilyn Radbourne Okay. So, it's more the operational side then. Hunter Harrison Which Cherilyn, gives the flow through obviously to the bottom line. Cherilyn Radbourne Right. And then just a quick one on CapEx, you have adjusted down by about 5% for 2017, can you just talk about what you've already found room to trim there? Frank Lonegro Sure, so you are right. We started out the year with about 1.97 billion in core capital meeting before you get the positive train control. We trimmed little over a 100 million from that number as we gave you the free cash flow numbers for the year. What we really did was we looked at all of the network investments and then to pause some of those given the fact that we are making terminal changes operating plan changes we have higher expectations for service products and so we really got to give that sometime to sync in before we decide exactly where we want to deploy some of that network capital. And then, on some of the return seeking projects to the point Hunter made earlier, we really looked at ways that we can get there through better process, better execution of that process and better accountability etcetera. So, we found some opportunity on both of those category. Cherilyn Radbourne Thank you, that's all from me. Operator Thank you. And next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. You may ask your question. Walter Spracklin Yes, thanks very much and welcome back Hunter. Hunter Harrison Hi, Walt. Walter Spracklin My question is on the free cash flow and how that's going to go into your buyback program leverage. I know you announced $1 billion new program here but I know how you've always liked your buyback. Leverage doesn't seem to be an issue at all and if I don't know if you huddled with Frank here little bit and talked about longer term where you want to see your leverage ratio go to and as a result and with the free cash flow you are going to generate from your initiatives. Could we see a much more expanded buyback in the billion dollar announcement here this morning? Hunter Harrison Well Frank spent a lot of time this week with the board and the finance committee and I have believe it or not got the back up from that discussion and be a little more operating focused and let me let Frank help you there. Frank Lonegro Yes, we had a great discussion this week and obviously you have heard us reiterate the BBB+/Baa1. Today you saw the size of the program for the next 12 months obviously as we get more and more monthly quarters under our belt and we get an understanding of the free cash flow numbers both for coming quarters and coming years. We'll take a hard look at whether or not we are deploying the capital in the correct way to shareholders in the correct amounts and we always look at the balance sheet and try to determine what the appropriate place is given really the cyclicality of the business on the merchandise and intermodal side as well as the capital intent for the business and making sure we preserve the access to the marketplace that we need in tougher time. So, we want to stress test the numbers that we have internally to make sure if there is in fact a holding line or any can see decline that we can stomach that. So, we think we are on pretty good shape with good numbers up for you in the quarter and the forward guidance as well as the buyback and the dividends. So, right now we feel like in pretty shape. Hunter Harrison Yes. Also, I don't think our policy going to be different than what we you have been familiar with, okay. If you look at allocation basal, the first call is going to be always reinvestment in this railroad and hopefully we got opportunities to make the appropriate returns there. If those don’t present their self, then we're going to look at other ways the most efficient ways as Frank described to return that case to the owner, whether it's through buyback, dividend, combinations thereof, will always be a little debated about what your structure is and what kind of fund you are managing and which customers want which. But I think we, I think the board yesterday had our both for two days estimating these and the board meeting, that a third discussion of our policies there and there was a great deal of common understanding in directionally which way we need to go. Walter Spracklin Okay. This is the second question here is on the competitive response to your initiatives both from a service standpoint but also from a operating standpoint as you get lower cost, your ability to more efficiently and higher profitability services for customers. And I am just interested in what the competitive response might be that might cause problems for you Hunter, in terms of what you're trying to achieve. I know you've always had a great view on pricing, the pricing is what the market dictates but often we hear when market share shifts, they want it on price. So, is there a risk that a competitive response might come in and may put problems on how you can effect change or make them a little longer to achieve at the end of the day? Do you have any views on that? Hunter Harrison Yes. Then they ought to be careful. If that's the response, look, as I think it's just pretty simple response. As long as we provide the service we talk about today and we become and we are going to get there the low cost carrier, okay, we got to worry about to tell you. I don't know what they are going to do in the way of response that is smart, is they can do that first. After competitors doing things stupid, that's good. And sometimes it's short term pain but I don't think that I'd see anything out there but this they are going to have some different response than they've had six months ago than what they are going to have in the future that's going to set this organization back. We get an agenda, we have got a wonderful customer base, we are going to see some organic growth. I'm convinced we're going to see some market share growth. I got to be a little patient there but this is going to come together. And I don't think a lot of what takes places is going to be negatively impacted by the competition. Walter Spracklin Is there, there is a view out there that it can be emulated that some of your initiatives can just be copied and the efficiency you achieve can be followed by your competitors or anything you'd respond to that with regards to what you're doing and a unique way you are doing it that will make it more difficult for the competition to copy you? Hunter Harrison Couple of that would. It's on eBay for a $1000, I mean, it's the market, if not then we can't get it recopy that some of the competition used to work for all of those to get copy rights business. It's not secret, okay. It's one thing to write its play book, okay. A lot of companies keep sitting down and give you yes and no, okay. The key is you got to have players that can execute. You don’t have to play, you're going to execute. You steal every play but you all. So, I hope they do copy but if they copy us, I think they might be more efficient and I'll look at other rails generally speaking much more is our partners is our near competitor. Of course, we had so much airline business too here. So, we have that. The secrets in this, I miss them. Walter Spracklin Fair enough, thanks very much. Hunter Harrison Thank you. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question. Scott Schneeberger Thanks, good morning. Hunter, I was curious, just your comment taking two to three days out of the Chicago Jacksonville route, I'm curious what type of time it would take to do such a thing and is that unique because the Chicago should we expect that more broadly then? Hunter Harrison Well, that's I think you expect it broadly. If you look at the overall velocity, I mean, I just used Chicago for an example and how quick can you see it, you can see it overnight. I mean, we are starting to reach schedules at railroad, I know that the main company has gotten especially Florida pretty well reworked and done and that’s been I've been doing some looking, work for towards and on. And so, we're going to kind of go up the line, we will have what you have been used to before with every guy have its own trip plan. One plan, they only get re-tripped and re-tripped, you got one plan, we got to tell the customers going to be 83 hours door-to-door and we're going to do it. And one of the ways to do it is this. Look, I -- we've get a lot of good things going, we got some things, we got to say. Our train speed is not right out of it, our merchandise train speeds between terminals is like 18 miles an hour. We got the potential to be at 27, 28, and you start taking numbers like that and then you avoid terminals and rather than drive into a terminal and dwell for 26 hours you can drive by that one and skip that 26 and pick up a little here and you do the math and don’t take long, you get to Florida two or three days quicker depending on where at large you are going. That's just an order of magnitude that impact both service and cost and asset turns and all of the stuff is good. Scott Schneeberger Great, thanks. And then just some of the -- with regards to this year's operating ratio guidance, what is the one big bucket item that you think could where you could outperform and then maybe a bucket item where you are most nervous where you may underperform? Thanks. Hunter Harrison That's how way late wake at night worry about that in that regard. If something happens that I'm not aware of or there is some geopolitical or something happens in Washington or something like that but I mean this is a pretty simple formula of there something that most of us have been in our whole life and they'll have to do this railroad, and that's how we got to do to get these things accomplished. Now, I mean obviously look, people, when you take a 1000 people as an organization, that's a bit hit. It's a big saving right there. That's a lot of it, but the other thing that you look at, the rail cars, the train starts, the start and the yard starts with the closest to the hub. All those things, those are natural that kind of about working capital will be then go -- we weren’t going to be with the best part for some of these entirely. Retires, and these old up gear, they don’t like them anymore. So, we have moved a lot of profit there but this is going to happen. Scott Schneeberger Great, thanks. Operator  Thanks. Your next question comes from Duran Marabala with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, you may ask your question. Duran Marabala Yes. Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Hunter, I guess just one question from me on the revenue side. I am wondering, is there any sort of revenue that you see on the book of business that maybe doesn't meet the return thresholds and maybe needs to be demarcated. I know some of that did happen with CP sort of early on in the process there. Thank you. Hunter Harrison No. Look, there is some odds and ends that just pops every once a while with the individual move or something. Everybody goes through a little bit of that, but generally speaking I mean for instance then maybe they're here to point those kind of things out and obviously if they were there and I was coming, you might have been motivated to get them out of there. You have to and so no we are not going to demark and we're looking at marking. Duran Marabala Thank you, that's helpful. Operator Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. You may ask your question. Justin Long Thanks and good morning. I know it's still early but I was wondering if you could talk about any structural changes to the network that we could see this year as it relates to divestitures of non-core assets and when thinking about that mid-60s OR guidance for 2017, does that include the impact of any real-estate gains? Hunter Harrison The second part, no we don't include any real-estate gain. The real-estate gain is it where they are and that's been discussed internally, are all gravy but I can tell you that the experience in the past, there are lots of opportunity up there, even now in Chicago. And it's a big number in my book and it's something that we will be sensitive to and talk to about. It's not going to drive the business but it certainly going to be in the bucket and the blender when we make certain operating decisions about where we operate from and locate and let me make sure I understood the first part of the question. Justin Long Just asking about the potential for divestitures at some points in this year, maybe some short line assets that you would view as being non-core to the franchise? Hunter Harrison There is not anything. Look, there is a lot of initiatives going on here that I am sure that I am not even aware of yet that but to my knowledge there is nothing of any large metrics that we are looking at what we’ve been both the knowledge just getting better what we do with the franchise that we have. Justin Long Okay. And secondly, Hunter you made the comment earlier that this franchise has more potential than any other you've dealt with. With that in mind do you think there is a path for this business to have industry leading margins or do you think there are structural limitations getting to an OR level that we've recently seen from the Canadian route. Hunter Harrison No, I think you can have the industry leading margins, I think you will have. The only issue there in massive world is if I can get all that done before I have to go, I'd like to be here to cut the ribbon, that's kind of big deal it's just a little personal goal but there is no reason that structurally certain I know knowing that this railroad it can now become the greatest road in north America. If it's greatest in North America, it's probably greatest in the world. And let me just [indiscernible] people look at this. I went to Canada the first time as an American and meant not fun to begin with, but I got there and seeing it just can do with great restructuring coming out of that deal and it's impressive numbers but the one thing they did is a problem, do not expect the Canadian railroad to ever achieve numbers like the US rail, it's just not structurally possible until our operating ratio went to the leading operating ratio in North America. And then just what the US roads did. The US roads did, look we're going to improve but don't think we are ever going to reach the level of the Canadian road, it's just not structurally possible. So, it's got something new with what you're paid for exists and where do you reside, but it's the same vein, that whole board up here does mean that much. Justin Long Okay, great. I appreciate the time and we are all looking forward to watching this play out. Hunter Harrison Thanks. Operator Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. You may ask your question. Brian Konigsberg Hey, good morning. Thanks for bidding me in and welcome Hunter. And just almost all my questions have been answered. I think an award is deserved for many of the analysts still coming up with stuff this late into the call. But I guess just the one thing just for the model sake, obviously Hunter you've got an employment contract that has been stamped and we're still waiting for the result of the shareholder meeting. We'll expect that to go through most likely. So, how should we be baking in kind of the share grants and additional payment set have been agreed upon so far throughout this year in cash flows and into these share baseline? Hunter Harrison Yes. I'm not sure that it's appropriate for me to address that, let me let Frank address that. Frank Lonegro So, in terms of the share based compensation, obviously we book expense on that one onto the Black-Scholes model and we've done that in terms of the guidance that we've given you. In terms of the shareholder vote, obviously you heard David's opening remarks and we're not going to touch on that one. But the free cash flow number that we gave you for the year is excluding the existing restructuring charges and any subsequent restructuring charges that might happen in the second quarter. Brian Konigsberg And so just presumably the share count could does not reflect any grants at this point but that can certainly change at their shareholder meeting. Is that -- I am just saying the share grants, I presume it's not in the numbers now and likely not in the guidance that was provided but that could change after the shareholder meeting that could be baked in our next discussion if it's approved. Frank Lonegro The numbers we gave you, the around $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow excludes the cash impact of the things that we're discussing both in the first quarter and perhaps things that could happen subsequently in the second quarter. Is that cleared now? Brian Konigsberg Yes. I could follow-up on that offline but that helps. Thank you. Frank Lonegro Okay. Operator Thank you. And this does conclude the question and answer session. At this time, I will turn the call over to Hunter Harrison for closing remarks. Hunter Harrison Well, thanks very much for joining us in a very simulating goal. Hopefully, we have answered all your questions. And I got a rental key. So, if you'll excuse me. Thanks. Operator This concludes today's teleconference.
