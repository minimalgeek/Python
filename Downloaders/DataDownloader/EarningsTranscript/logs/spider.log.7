Thanks, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the O'Reilly Auto Parts first quarter conference call. Participating on the call with me this morning in their positions is Co-Presidents are Greg Johnson and Jeff Shaw, and of course Tom McFall, our Chief Financial Officer is also participating, and David O'Reilly, our Executive Chairman is also present. I would like to begin our call today by thanking Team O'Reilly for their continued dedication to our company's success and their unwavering commitment to providing consistently excellent levels of customer service to our valued customers. As we outlined in our press release and we'll discuss in our comments today, our top-line sales performance fell short of our expectations driven by challenging external factors we faced in the quarter, but our team remained diligent in executing our business model for the long haul by insuring we put an even more pronounced emphasis on our customer service levels during the quarter. Our Professional Parts people are the very best at what they do. And it's their contributions that have driven our success as a company and will continue to drive us forward as a market leader. Now, I'll make some brief comments about our quarterly performance before I turn it over to Greg, Jeff and Tom for more of a detailed overview. When we held our year-end conference call on February 7th, we established a comparable store sales guidance range of 2% to 4%, which was below our typical expectations of 3% to 5%. This was the result of the impact of the mild January temperatures as well as our belief that we likely saw some pull-forward of winter weather related sales in the December of last year due to the extreme cold weather we had in many markets at the end of 2016. Unfortunately, the seasonably mild weather continued in February and the resulting softness in our business was exacerbated by the delay of tax refund money to early filers, which as you know was deferred by several weeks this year compared to the prior year. We saw business improved markedly towards the end of February as our customers began to receive these income tax refunds. However, this positive trend was halted at the beginning of March as a result of cold wet weather, including late winter storms in many of our markets. This type of weather would have been a positive in January or February, but was a significant headwind to our business in much of March as customers awaited spring weather. When we look at our by-category sales, this unusual weather drove softness in weather-sensitive categories like engine cooling, rotating electrical and anti-freeze. On the tax return front, the delay in refunds was a positive to March, which despite the late winter weather was the strongest month of the quarter. But at this point, we believe some of the opportunity to capture a share of early filers' tax return money related to repairs needed due to extreme weather in some cases has been delayed. To be clear, many of the parts that might have failed in extreme weather will still fail. The failure has just been pushed into the future by the mild winter weather. Greg Johnson will discuss our sales expectations moving forward in detail when I turn the call over to him in a few moments, but I will say we view the challenges we faced in the quarter to be transient and believe the onset of normal spring weather will restore demand in our broader industry. As we noted in our press release yesterday, the shortfall in sales in the first quarter created leverage pressure on all areas of our business. However, even in light of these pressures, we were pleased that our team was able to continue to execute our expense control culture to generate a very respectable 18.7% operating profit. Unfortunately, our performance this quarter ended our incredible streak of 32 consecutive quarters of 15% or greater EPS growth. We are certainly disappointed to see this streak come to an end, but I want to take this opportunity to recognize and congratulate our team for this amazing run of generating outstanding results for our shareholders each quarter for the last eight years. While we are, obviously, not pleased with our comparable store sales performance in the first quarter. We remain extremely confident in not only our business model and industry-leading supply-chain, but also our team of outstanding Parts Professionals and the Team O'Reilly culture they live every day across our company. As we move past the short-term pressures we faced in the first quarter, we believe we are very well-positioned to grow our market share by continuing to leverage our industry-leading distribution model and providing the unsurpassed levels of customer service that has put us in the industry-leading position we've maintained the past several years. I want to, again, thank Team O'Reilly for your continued dedication to our customers. At this time, I will turn the call over to Greg Johnson to provide more color on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Gregory D. Johnson - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. To begin, I would like to echo Greg's comments and thank Team O'Reilly for their continued hard work and dedication to providing outstanding customer service every day. While we certainly aren't pleased with our comparable store sales results for the quarter, we know that market conditions we face in the quarter created significant volatility in our results, especially against the backdrop of very difficult comparable store sales comparisons of 6.1% last year and 13.3% on a two year stack basis. Our ability to still be able to generate positive comparable store sales growth despite the tough prior year comparisons and the specific headwinds in the first quarter is a testament to the quality of our team. I would now like to provide a little more color on the composition of our comparable store sales growth for the first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year. Despite the challenging conditions we faced in the first quarter, we were able to generate positive comparable store sales growth in both our Professional and DIY businesses. As we discussed in the past, any pressure to consumer discretionary income is more impactful on the DIY side of the business as these customers are often forced to repair their own vehicles out of economic necessity. This is reflected in our results for the first quarter as the delay in tax refunds, while a significant headwind to both sides of our business, was more impactful on the DIY side and resulted in comps to those customers underperforming our professional customer comps. However, the negative weather impacts that we saw throughout the quarter were felt on both sides of the business and we received consistent feedback from across our professional customer base that their business suffered from the lack of extreme weather and the slow start to spring. We saw solid increase in ticket average, but we experienced pressure in both DIY and professional ticket count comps as a result of the sluggish sales environment. As has been the case for several years, we realized no benefit from increases in selling price as inflation remains muted. As Greg mentioned earlier, we view the headwinds we faced in the first quarter as temporary. And we still feel confident we'll see favorable demand environment for the balance of the year that will enable us to deliver long-term profitable growth. We established our 2017 guidance based on the improved health of the overall economy, continued sustained improvements in employment, positive trends in miles driven, an aging and growing vehicle fleet and the ability of our team to deliver outstanding customer service. Despite the slow start to the year, we see all these drivers of our business as intact. We exited March on a more solid footing and we're performing within our expectations thus far in April. As such, we are setting our second quarter comparable store sales guidance at 3% to 5% and reiterating our full comparable store sales guidance range of 3% to 5% as well. Turning to our gross margin results, we finished the quarter with a gross profit of 52.5%, which was an increase of 10 basis points over the first quarter results from last year. This was below our expectations coming into the quarter due to mix headwinds from unseasonable weather, deleverage of fixed costs in our gross margin as a result of the soft sales, and larger than anticipated LIFO headwinds, however, we believe that the pressure caused by these specific challenges we faced in the first quarter is temporary and we are leaving our gross margin expectation for the full year unchanged. Looking specifically at gross margin for the second quarter, our 2016 second quarter resulted – our second quarter results included a larger than normal LIFO charge related to acquisition cost reductions from a specific vendor negotiation last year. While we still see significant year-over-year benefit in our gross profit percentage as we calendar this item from last year, we do expect second quarter 2017 gross margin percentage to be slightly below our annual target, as a result of the seasonal mix of our business. However, we still expect our full-year gross profit to be within our original guidance range of 52.8% to 53.2% of sales. During the quarter, we generated earnings per share of $2.83. As noted in our press release yesterday, these results included a $0.23 benefit from a change in accounting related to the tax benefit from stock option gains, which Tom will discuss in more detail later. Excluding this change, our EPS fell well short of our guidance range as a result of the sluggish sales and corresponding leverage pressures on our business. While we are not satisfied with our results thus far in 2017, we remain confident the challenges we faced in the first quarter are temporary in nature and that the remainder of the year sets up well for us to achieve our planned growth and profitability and deliver a full-year operating profit within our original guidance range of 20.1% to 20.5% of sales. We are also reiterating our full-year EPS guidance range to $12.05 to $12.15 and establishing our second quarter EPS guidance range at $3.10 to $3.20. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to, again, thank our team for their hard work and dedication to our company's continued success. We remain very confident in the long-term drivers for demand in our industry and we believe we are very well-positioned to capitalize on this demand as we move forward in 2017 by consistently providing industry-leading customer service and parts availability. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff Shaw. Jeff? Jeff M. Shaw - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. As both Greg and Greg have stated, we certainly faced a tough market environment in the first quarter. Our team's consistent industry-leading performance over our history has set a very high bar and we were disappointed that we weren't able to deliver our typical mid-single digit or better comparable store sales. However, our team hasn't wavered in delivering exceptional service to each of our customers and we're as committed as ever to rolling up our sleeves and out-hustling our competitors to earn our customers' business each and every day. Now, I'd like to spend a little time talking about our SG&A expense for the first quarter. As we've discussed several times in the past, we manage our SG&A spend with a long-term focus and won't make drastic changes to slash SG&A expenses on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Instead, our teams remain very focused on expense control every quarter, but are judicious in managing our store staffing levels to ensure we don't jeopardize the excellent customer service that develops and maintains long-term relationships. No other expense more directly impacts our level of customer service and each store's ability to grow our business than store payroll. And our store operations teams use a number of tools to manage store staffing and productivity on a store-by-store, day-by-day basis. Ultimately, we're in the customer service business in a highly competitive industry and the primary reason for our customers choose to do business is the level of customer service they receive. As a result, we take a prudent approach to adjusting staffing levels in our stores over time and won't allow soft patches to result in dramatic short-term swings in store payroll as this will damage long-term relationships. With this objective in mind, we're pleased with the expense control focus our team showed in the first quarter, with our average SG&A per store up only 1.4% over the prior year. Below our initial expectations, as our team made the appropriate adjustments, while still delivering on the excellent service our customers expect. The deleverage of our SG&A expense, we saw in the quarter, was a byproduct of the sluggish sales environment and we're confident that we'll be able to leverage our SG&A expenses in line with our previous guidance as comps improve, which has led us to keep our operating profit guidance unchanged for the full year. We continue to expect our full-year increase in average SG&A per store to be approximately 1.5% to 2% for the year and we'll continue to make the appropriate adjustments as needed to prudently manage SG&A expenses both up and down to match business trends and the opportunities that we see in the marketplace. We successfully opened 59 net-new stores during the first quarter, with our new store performance within our expectations given the broader demand environment. During the quarter, we opened stores in 25 different states with the highest concentration in some of our newer growth markets in the Southeast and Northeast, as well as continued growth in existing markets such as Texas. We continue to see great opportunities to open new stores across our coast-to-coast footprint and this diverse growth profile allows us to develop and train great teams of Parts Professionals who are ready to provide top-notch customer service from day one. The strong start to our new store growth in 2017 puts us well on our way to our full-year growth target of 190 net-new stores and provides us with the flexibility we need to devote significant resources in the remainder of the year to converting the Bond stores that we acquired in December. We just recently completed the store systems conversions and are now servicing each of the acquired Bond stores with five-night-a-week delivery from our Devens distribution center. We're now servicing approximately 142 stores out of this facility with the capacity to service an additional 145 stores and we continue to view the Northeast as a very favorable expansion market. Before I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to thank our team for their continued dedication to providing the best customer service in our industry. Clearly, we began the quarter in a tough weather environment, knowing we were facing very tough comp comparisons, and the external market conditions didn't improve to give us much of an opportunity to make up ground during the remainder of the quarter. However, our teams just redoubled their efforts and worked that much harder to take care of our customers and still were able to continue our string of generating positive comparable store sales in-spite of the industry-wide headwinds. I'm very confident that we have the right team in place to continue to provide unwavering customer service and lead our industry. And I look forward to our opportunities to take market share as we move through 2017. Now, I'll turn the call over to Tom. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Jeff. Now we'll take a closer look at our quarterly results and update our guidance for the remainder of 2017. For the quarter, sales increased $60 million, comprised of $32 million increase in comp store sales, a $56 million increase in non-comp store sales, a $25 million decrease from one less day in 2017 as compared to Leap Day in 2016, a $2 million decrease in non-comp non-store sales, and a $1 million decrease from closed stores. Consistent with our historic practice, we have included the results of the acquired Bond stores as a component of our comparable store sales calculation starting in the first quarter. For 2017, we continued to expect our total revenues to be $9.1 billion to $9.3 billion. For the quarter, gross margin was 52.5% of sales, an improvement of 10 basis points over the prior year. As we've seen for the last several years, our first quarter results were impacted by LIFO headwinds resulting from continued incremental acquisition cost reductions. The headwind was $7 million in the first quarter, which was higher than we expected and we were anticipating a similar headwind in the second quarter. I would now like to provide some additional details on the impact to our earnings per share from the adoption of our new share based compensation accounting standard during – we adopted during the first quarter of 2017. The new standard requires excess tax benefits related to share based compensation payments to be recorded through the income statement. For us, this primarily relates to gains our team members realized upon exercise of stock options, where the company receives a corresponding tax benefit in excess of the previously estimated benefit recognized upon issuance of the equity award. Previously, these benefits were reflected directly in shareholders' equity and were not recorded through the income statement. With this change in accounting standards, we saw reduction to our effective tax rate to 31.2% of pre-tax income, which drove a $0.25 benefit to our earnings per share results for the first quarter. This benefit was partially offset by a $0.02 EPS decrease from an increase to our diluted shares outstanding calculation, also required by the new accounting standard, resulting in a net $0.23 benefit to EPS for the quarter. Excluding the impact of this accounting change, our core underlying effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.3% of pre-tax income in-line with our expectations. For the full-year, we continued to expect this core tax rate, excluding the benefit from the accounting change, to be 37%. With the remaining quarters being relatively consistent with the exception of the third quarter, when we adjust our tax reserves for the totaling (21:00) of open tax periods. In line with our normal practice, our earnings per share guidance for the remainder of the year includes all of the shares repurchased through this call but does not include any future share repurchases, and also does not include any future potential benefit from the accounting change for options beyond the first quarter of 2017. Now, we'll move onto free cash flow and the component that drove our results in the quarter and our guidance and expectations for the full-year of 2017. Free cash flow for the quarter was $243 million, which was $141 million decrease from the prior year driven by an increase in our net inventory in the first three months of 2017, compared to a decrease in the prior year. Inventory per store at the end of the quarter was $588,000, which was a 2% increase from the end of 2016. For the full-year, we continued to expect inventory per store to grow approximately 1.5% to 2%. Our ongoing goal was to ensure we grow per store inventory at a lower rate than the comparable store sales growth we generate. And we expect to continue our success of effectively deploying inventory in 2017. Our AP-to-inventory ratio finished the first quarter at 104%, which is down from the 106% at the end of 2016 and was below our expectations, as a result of the lower level of inventory purchases related to the soft sales environment in the quarter. As we move into our busy summer selling season, we expect to see our AP-to-inventory ratio to build through the balance of the year and to finish in line with our previous guidance of 107%. The compression of our AP-to-inventory ratio was the primary factor driving the decrease in our free cash flow for the first quarter. As a result, we are reiterating our full-year guidance of $930 million to $980 million, which reflects our full-year expectation of a modest increase in our AP ratio. Finally, CapEx for the quarter ended up at $111 million, which was up slightly from the first quarter of 2016 and in line with our expectations. We continue to forecast CapEx at $470 million to $500 million for the full year of 2017. Moving onto debt. We finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.69 times, which is consistent with our ratio at the end of 2016 and still well below our targeted range of 2 to 2.25 times. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we completed a new credit agreement, which established a $1.2 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing our previous $600 million facility that was set to expire next year. We were pleased with the execution of the agreement and the additional liquidity we added will allow us more financial flexibility. We continue to believe our stated leverage range is appropriate for our business and will move into this range when the timing is appropriate. We continue to execute our share repurchase program and year-to-date; we've repurchased 2.1 million shares at an average price of $266.87 for a total investment of $566 million. We continue to view our buyback program as an effective means to returning available cash to our shareholders after we take advantage of opportunities to invest in our business at a high rate of return. And we will prudently execute our program with an emphasis on maximizing long-term returns for our shareholders. Finally, before I open up the call for questions, I'd like to thank the entire O'Reilly Team for their continued dedication to the company's long-term success. This concludes our prepared comments. At this time, I'd like to ask Victoria, the operator, to return to the line and we'll be happy to answer your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks, good morning, guys. A couple of weather questions and I'm sure not the last of this call. The March to April shift, is that simply the timing of the DIY spring business overall? And then related to that, I believe April is the second easiest monthly compare behind May with a tougher June. So you talked about the quarter or April running in line with expectations and mentioned 3% to 5%. Does that suggest that it's within that 3% to 5% range or should we think about it being better given how the business is shifting and the compare overall? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. What I would say first about the March to April shift, as spring time gets your DIY customers start to do repairs on their cars more prevalent and some of the damage that was done in the winter they start repairing as they're able to work on their cars outside and so forth. And that's one of the reasons we see the increase. Last year, our best month of the quarter was June, second was April, third was May. So we're comparing and there wasn't that much difference between April and June but June was the best. So we're comparing against a healthy month last year in April. What I would tell you about our first quarter and kind of our progression into second quarter is that looking at our first quarter the damage was done in February. The period of time that we compared against the period last year where the early filers had their tax refund money and they did not this year. Those few weeks there were pretty big declines in our comp store sales, really on a weekly basis some of the biggest I've seen. It just clearly showed us how much difference it makes when you compare a period where lower income consumers have money in their pocket that they didn't have the week before and that was significant. We progressed out of that, kind of hit a weather block in March as some of the markets that are weather sensitive had kind of a late winter. And then the trend we came out of March on was healthy and the trend that we've been on so far in April has continued. There's a little bit of noise in April this year with the misalignment of Easter, but the trend that we've been on makes us feel confident with our ability to achieve the guidance range that we issued of 3% to 5% for both the second quarter and for the full-year, considering that all the fundamentals that we look at relative to miles driven, age of vehicles, unemployment, fuel price stability, things like that, we just reasoned that our industry wouldn't have a reasonably good year. And like I said, the trends that we've seen thus far in April give us confidence in achieving that. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, a little bit of parsing on the numbers. So you guided – you kept the 3% to 5% for the year after the 0.8%, the 3% to 5% for – and you issued 3% to 5% guide for the second quarter, so is there some sort of expectation that you could be sort of the north end of that 3% to 5%, or a 4% to 6% in the back half to end up solidly in that 3% to 5% range. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, if we just – yeah, there would be some expectation towards the back half of the year that we would generate towards the upper end of that range. But we wouldn't have to generate much towards the upper end of that range to get in the 3% to 5% range for the year. But, yeah, there would have to be some of that. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. The other thing that I would point out, Chris, is our first quarter is our lightest quarter both from a daily sales volume and the number of stores in the comp base. So as we roll through the year each quarter, especially the second and third quarter count substantially more towards the full year. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Understood. Thanks very much, guys. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay, thanks, Chris. Operator Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Hi, I had a follow-up and then another question. Just to make sure I got – interpreted that right. So what you've seen so far in April is that you are actually in that 3% to 5% range? Just to make sure I got that clear, Greg. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, what I would say because we have a displacement of Easter coming into the second quarter. We had an uneven compare between the quarters as to where Easter fell in the years. So what I would say is that – and to quantify that for such a short period of time is a little bit difficult because you don't know what we would have done had we not had Easter this year. But what I would say is, is that we're pleased with the trend we're on and the trend that we're on would lead us to having confidence in achieving the 3% to 5% range for the second quarter. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI And it sounds like February – in terms of in the first quarter, February was a negative month and the other two were positive? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. That's correct. Yeah. January was positive. March was the best month of the period. February was negative, which is the first negative month that I remember for a while, but – and it wasn't just a little bit negative. It was a reasonable amount negative due to the two weeks in the middle of the month where the tax refund comparison was significant. And we had a couple of rough weeks there. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Got it. And so then my – the actual question I had was stepping back a little bit. Can you just remind us in terms of understanding the customer, trip down to DIY side, what sort of demographic they look like and taking the weather out of it, but just what sort of drives demand? How much of the business is cash business? I think I remember it being something like 30% compared to – it's a lot different than a lot of other retailers. So if you could help us understand that customer demographic in the tender form, I think, that will be helpful. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I'll make a few comments, and I think Tom wants to make a couple of comments. Our typical DIY consumer would be a lower income consumer who is driven to work on their own cars out of economic necessity. They're typically – we target generally speaking in our advertising efforts males from the age of 18 to 54 because they're typically the most driven to work on their own cars and try to do things that some may not try to do when it comes to DIY repair. But typically they're incentivized to work on their own car because of economic need and they're trying to avoid paying labor to shop to do so. And Tom, you may have something to... Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. On the question on tender. It's heavily cash and then when we look at cards presented, there are many more debit cards presented than actual credit cards. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI So, a majority of the DIY business is cash or just – is my 30%, a good guess or? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. I don't have the percentages sitting in front of me. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Okay. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. But if we take cash and debit cards, so it's coming straight out of the account. It's significantly higher than that. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Got it. All right, thanks. I'll give someone else a shot. Good luck, guys. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Please go ahead. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Thank you very much. So, Greg, your guidance of 3% to 5% comp in both 2Q and the full year certainly underscores your belief in the business. But is there anything incremental in the last quarter that leads you to believe that the competitive dynamic versus Amazon or e-commerce overall is any different than what you've said 90 days ago? And then I do have a follow-up. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. No, Alan, there's not been anything happen that would cause us to think that. As a matter of fact and really more because of the noise that has been generated with some of the analyst's reports and so forth. And I totally understand it relative to the disruption that some of the online retailers have caused with other brick-and-mortar retailers. I've spent some time talking to some of our supplier principals who might sell online retailers, which we obviously don't care for that that much. But still some of them that make sense for them to sell online retailers and work to protect the price at which the products are sold and so forth. But, and I think – I've known a lot of these guys for a long time and I have every reason to believe that they would shoot me straight relative to the amount of volume they do with some of these online retailers. I think that most of you would be really disappointed to hear what some of the suppliers that you might think would be major suppliers to online retailers, the amount of volume they're actually doing. And that volume is not on a ramp up that I think some of the commentary would lead people to believe. So while I – there's obviously products, especially accessories and some of the more ancillary products that go on cars, there's obviously a marketplace online that will serve them. But for the majority of our business in hard parts, I don't feel like that we're exposed much to online retailers and I don't see that changing in the short-term. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up, Greg or Tom. So your guidance 90 days ago for the full year was $12.05 to $12.15, which you're now reiterating. What is the impact in the new number that you're issuing today, $12.05 to $12.15 from the change in the accounting principle? What will that number be for the full year? And then just to confirm, the Leap Day which cost you $25 million. That correlates to about 120 basis points. Would it be correct to assume that just that one factor alone would have led you to put up a 2% comp rather than 0.8%? Thank you. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay. On the full-year guidance, obviously we were short of our expectations in the first quarter absent the comp change in accounting. However, when we look at our full year guidance and maybe I could have been clearer in the script, our full-year guidance includes the actual tax benefit experienced in the first quarter. So, we've got the headwind from the missed x (35:42), the change in accounting for options. We've got the positive from the options and we've got some positive in the last three quarters of the year for the shares we bought in the first quarter that weren't included really since our last conference call. So that's how we bridge back to the same EPS. So our expectation is that – or we have not given any guidance for what the gain will be from the new accounting for the rest of the year. And we'll obviously continue to report those separately. Same way we look at share repurchases. We will buy some shares back between now and the end of the year, but we don't include that in our guidance. On the second question, could you remind me of what that was? Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC The Leap Day. Did it cost you 120 basis points to the comp, Tom? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. It did not. Leap Day was excluded from our comp calculation last year. So when you look at the 6.1% comp we put up in the first quarter of 2016 that excluded Leap Day. When we talk about the total sales, obviously I denoted those in my script. That rolls into the total sales. And I think as we commented on last year's call, it was about that additional day has a great flow through because so many fixed costs, we don't pay more for the extra day within the month added about $0.05 to EPS last year. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Okay. Thank you very much. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Alan. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you for taking my question. Not to beat a dead horse but I do believe there was some delay in the tax refund last year, certainly not to the extreme that we saw this year. Can you remind us what impact you saw last year as a result of that? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Tom, do you know the answer? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, we saw – last year when we look at February, and the tax return timing, we were also very fortunate that weather was very spring-like and we were able to capture quite a bit of that money when people had money in their pocket right away. Weather was beneficial to go out and work on your car which this year it was not, but we didn't quantify the exact number just saying that February was our strongest month last year. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. And do you have a sense of what the industry was down in February as a result this year? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. I think we'll anxiously await our other public competitors to report and take a look at that. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. And then just to wrap up this question. Just given the impact which seems to be much more negative for DIY in February, I assume the bigger lift that we will see for the rest of the year will be coming from DIY in your guidance? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. We would expect to continue to see some bounce back, but the weather factor, a cool winter and a late start to spring as Greg comments, you'll really weight on both sides of the business. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Kate. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Sure. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC One of your competitors referenced, I guess, the difference between national accounts and tire stores et cetera versus general repair shops. Have you seen anything similar in your business? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Jeff, you might have a comment on that, but I don't think we've seen much difference or any that would be significant. I think that all of us work to gain market share with the national accounts. And I don't think we noted a difference. Jeff, did you see anything? Jeff M. Shaw - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. No. No, I think the traffic would be fairly similar across those accounts. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Okay, that's helpful. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. I think generally speaking, across our business we saw the pressure from the milder winter which would not drive demand for the winter sensitive products, and then the late tax refunds during those weeks in February where that was comparison issues. Jeff M. Shaw - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. The other thing I might mention, Greg, is we have put more of a focus on the national accounts over the last couple of years and those accounts are still trending up with us. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, so we're gaining market share with those guys, yeah. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC That was actually my follow-up question and I'll hop-off. But, now that you're in the Northeast, now you clearly have planted more flags, you're coming from the Southeast, you truly are becoming more national. Can you talk about your conversations with some of those national installers and how those are changing given your increased presence? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I think we're doing a good job with them. We have got a team just like our competitors do that focuses on developing relationships and establishing purchasing relationships with those guys and, yeah, we feel like we're doing well. We feel like we're gaining market share on that side of the business. Some of it you want and obviously some of it our competitors want worse and they might sell them at a price that we might not be willing to. But in many cases we're able to get the business. And long-term the people that run the individual shops are looking for the best service providers. So I think that more often than not we win on service but you first have to have a relationship with the company that enables the systems to be integrated for ease and processing transactions at the shop. And we've gained some market share there the last couple of years and would expect over the next few years as we become more national by having a significant presence in the Northeast that we'll do better with those types of businesses. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Got you. Thanks. Good luck next quarter. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks, good morning. So March and April, clearly, picked up and it sounds like some of it was tax refund. But I guess what gives you confidence that we're just not seeing the other side of it now, meaning there was some pent up demand? And then could April's run rate be influenced by that, in other words, what makes you feel or is there any evidence to give you confidence that this is a new sustainable run rate and not just a bounce back from some pent up demand? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, Simeon, what I would say is just that the things that in the past we've looked at that have been drivers of demand or have been detractors from demand. Those fundamental factors are positive right now. And so all the things that we would look at that would indicate industry demand should be healthier, maybe not so healthy, they're all healthy right now. So I think that we have to feel like that generally speaking demand this year would be reasonably good. Now, that's not to say that our crystal ball is any better than yours, but we have been in this business a long time and have seen the ups and downs with the different vehicle population, gas prices, miles driven, things like that. And all those things are positive, indicating that demand should be good. So while there's no question that there could be some benefit to deferred maintenance and repairs from maybe the March weather and so forth that could have pushed business into late March or early April. It's hard for us not to feel like the fundamental drivers of demand in our business are very positive and we would expect the year for our industry to be a reasonably positive year. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Right. And I think though you mentioned you are seeing, I don't know if it's spring-related or early summer-related or spring-related business start to come into the mix. I don't know if that could be an indication of it. I don't know if I caught that earlier on the call. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I mean, we're – in most markets we're into spring time and we're starting to see the DIY maintenance type business that you would see and the shops are busier. We work very close with many of the shops that we partner with, and the shops businesses are picking up as they do every spring. And so yeah, we're seeing more typical spring time demand, early spring time demand as we would see every spring right now. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And just my follow-up is just on inflation. We hear from some of the oil companies are starting to see price increases, I think fuel's been inflationary. Are you seeing any signs on the input side three months, six months, a year out from now? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Greg, you may have a comment on that just from a supplier pricing standpoint, and then Tom, you can speak to it from a raw inflation standpoint. Gregory D. Johnson - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I mean, a lot of our commodities do fluctuate based on oil, for example, metals, things like that. So we do typically see fluctuation in prices based on lead pricing for batteries, things like that. We have seen some movement in base oil pricing over the past quarter and – but we don't – you never know what the future brings, but we feel like we've taken the bulk of that or at least we hope we have in the first quarter. And we've been able to pass some of that along, some of it we're still looking into (44:55). Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. When we look from a macro standpoint across all our products we continue to expect to have more LIFO pressures. We're going to have a similar number here in the second quarter we saw in the first quarter, those deals have already been inked. Could have come back a little bit from increases in oil, yeah, but we have pretty good visibility going forward. And we'd expect to continue to see in aggregate minor LIFO pressures, again, in the third and fourth quarters built into our guidance. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Hey, good morning, guys. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Could you talk a bit about regional performance too, I guess given the fact that some of that mild weather more significantly impacted Northern states. Are you seeing the correlation in weather in the various markets? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, yeah, I mean, we definitely had disparity on our regional performance. What we would say is that the markets that we would consider to be weather affected versus the markets that would be maybe not weather affected. And that's not a clear line, but we do our best to draw that line. That difference will be just slightly less of 400 basis points of difference. What I would tell you is that in the first quarter, our Western stores performed materially better than the East Coast stores relative to that because the East Coast stores are, obviously, more sensitive to weather and the West Coast stores less. Although for some period of time in the West, they had torrential rains that were impacting the business. I think we would have done a lot better out West if it hadn't been for the significant rainstorms that they had. But still even with that the West performed better than the East and the North of course. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Okay. And then a question, I guess, sort of housekeeping. The first quarter, obviously the earnings were within the guide but had the not operating positive, but you kept the EBIT margin guide constant for the year. So, I guess you must have some confidence that the operating improves? I guess, Tom, that was more tax impact on the stock based accounting not EBIT impact? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. That's correct. We still feel like with the comp range that we're anticipating and the SG&A spend we're anticipating and the gross margin. We're going to continue to be in the same operating margin range and don't feel the need to change it. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Great. If I can squeeze a quick one in, on the Bond stores you announced that the integration is progressing. Could you give us any color on how those stores are performing? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. We're happy with them. I would say that they're comparable from just a sales cadence standpoint to the stores that we have in the Northeast that have been somewhat weather affected, but yeah, we're happy with them. They're great teams at those stores. They're going to do much better with our inventory assortment and availability of our Devens distribution center inventory mix, which is a substantial increase in SKU count from what they were supplied by before. So, yeah, we're happy with them and we think they should continue to do well. The conversion just took place last weekend so they now have all of the availability tools that we will ultimately provide them and as they get used to that and trained in using those we would expect this to be a great summer and fall for them. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Great. Thank you very much. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Bret. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Greg, wanted to ask if there were any company-specific issues that adversely impacted sales in the first quarter or competitive changes. The reason I'm asking is the comp sales gap between O'Reilly and NAPA narrowed in the period compared to past levels. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. One would think that the tax refunds and so forth impacted both companies about the same. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. What I would tell you, Dan, is that there's not a day goes by that I don't have a conversation with someone hear about something, I think, could improve. And the job that Greg and Jeff and Tom and the rest our executive team do is that same way. We're very critical of ourselves. So what I would tell you is that we always feel like that we have opportunities to improve but there's been nothing changed relative to the opportunities that we have to improve relative to what we see at our competitors and the gap that should exist as a result of that. So I think my answer is no there's been no significant change and I wouldn't reflect our underperformance on comps in the first quarter to anything company specific here, although we always see opportunities to improve. We spend a week every year gathering input from our field as to the things that they feel like we can improve on and the competitive pressures that they might feel, and then we bring all of our executives together every year and come up with solutions to those and put a plan in place, and how we're going to resolve and correct those things. And it's just been a focus from way back when they were a private company and the family owned the business they did that, and we've continue to do that as a publicly traded company. And we feel like it serves us well. So do we have our opportunities? You bet we do. Do we feel like we're the best in the industry at what we do? Yeah we do. I think what we do is pretty incredible and I don't think there's been anything changed on that front. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. And also Tom, I wanted to follow up on Bret's question about the EBIT guidance. Given the share count that you're using now for the annual EPS forecast and excluding the lower tax rate, is it fair to say that your EBIT guidance towards that low end of that range of 20.1% instead of the mid or higher end? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. When you work through the math of where we are and kind of look at our guidance through the end of the year, we're going to be pressured below the midpoint at this point. Obviously, our goal is to get it back up to the midpoint. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Great, thank you. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks so much and good morning. I have two questions. The first is a financial one probably for Tom. If you could update us on what you're thinking is for the impact of LIFO on a full-year basis, I think at the end of Q4 you indicated that it would be about half of what it was in 2016. So is that still the case? And also just to clarify when you talked about half the impact was that essentially in total dollar terms? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, we were looking at – when we started the year we were looking at a LIFO impact between $20 million and $25 million for this year. I'd say based on having a higher first quarter number than we anticipated, which we talked about, we'd be in the higher end of that range. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. But still directionally if you were $49 million last year kind of the mid-$20s million is still a reasonable place to think about? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yes, sir. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. And then secondly, curious what you are seeing in your own online efforts in terms of DIY and commercial, whether one piece of the business or another is gaining more traction? And what you see consumers responding to as you test and learn about what the appeal is, and the desires from your customers to interact with you online? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Matt, this is Greg. From a B2B standpoint, we call our product First Call Online, which as you may know a lot of our Professional businesses done under the name of First Call for the most part. That business is awesome. We've do a – we've done an incredible job for a long time incentivizing and getting use from our professional customers of our B2B platform, which can work as a browser based product or it can be and is integrated in with many of the shop management systems. And a lot of our orders come from our customers via that platform and that's a growing platform that we'll continue to grow as we continue to enhance it with better features and benefits as we move forward. On the DIY side, we have a substantial business but we feel like we could do better. And we've got a lot of work underway right now to re-platform both our website and our mobile site to do some things that we would like it to do that we think would be more customer friendly. As online retail has been talked about, it's hard for us not to think that we would be – if customers are going to buy wiper blades, for instance, or an accessory, or something like that, that we might stock or have available from someone online. I mean, who better to buy it from with the 27 distribution centers across the country that know these products and can help them with these products. So we've got a substantial effort underway right now to improve our B2C business. And like I said, we have business, it's a nice business, but we feel like we could do more than what we are doing. And more than anything we view ourselves as building an omni-channel business, so that our customers when they go on our website or our mobile site see the same O'Reilly Auto Parts that they would see if they walked into one of our stores. So that's a significant project for us right now. And when I talk about the strategic goals that we have for the year that we set each year that I mentioned in response to one of the questions a moment ago that's one of our strategic goals. I think that if you look at our site a year from now you would be impressed with what it looks like then as compared to what it looks like now. And now it's pretty good, but I think it can be a lot better. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks so much, Greg. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. You bet. Thank you, Matt. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes – we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Henslee for closing remarks. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay, thanks, Victoria. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly Team for their diligent customer service in the first quarter. We remain extremely confident in our ability to continue to aggressively and profitably gain market share for the remainder of 2017. I would like to thank, everyone, for joining our call today and we look forward to reporting our 2017 second quarter results in July. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Chris Horvers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Thanks, good morning, guys. A couple of weather questions and I'm sure not the last of this call. The March to April shift, is that simply the timing of the DIY spring business overall? And then related to that, I believe April is the second easiest monthly compare behind May with a tougher June. So you talked about the quarter or April running in line with expectations and mentioned 3% to 5%. Does that suggest that it's within that 3% to 5% range or should we think about it being better given how the business is shifting and the compare overall? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. What I would say first about the March to April shift, as spring time gets your DIY customers start to do repairs on their cars more prevalent and some of the damage that was done in the winter they start repairing as they're able to work on their cars outside and so forth. And that's one of the reasons we see the increase. Last year, our best month of the quarter was June, second was April, third was May. So we're comparing and there wasn't that much difference between April and June but June was the best. So we're comparing against a healthy month last year in April. What I would tell you about our first quarter and kind of our progression into second quarter is that looking at our first quarter the damage was done in February. The period of time that we compared against the period last year where the early filers had their tax refund money and they did not this year. Those few weeks there were pretty big declines in our comp store sales, really on a weekly basis some of the biggest I've seen. It just clearly showed us how much difference it makes when you compare a period where lower income consumers have money in their pocket that they didn't have the week before and that was significant. We progressed out of that, kind of hit a weather block in March as some of the markets that are weather sensitive had kind of a late winter. And then the trend we came out of March on was healthy and the trend that we've been on so far in April has continued. There's a little bit of noise in April this year with the misalignment of Easter, but the trend that we've been on makes us feel confident with our ability to achieve the guidance range that we issued of 3% to 5% for both the second quarter and for the full-year, considering that all the fundamentals that we look at relative to miles driven, age of vehicles, unemployment, fuel price stability, things like that, we just reasoned that our industry wouldn't have a reasonably good year. And like I said, the trends that we've seen thus far in April give us confidence in achieving that. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. And then, a little bit of parsing on the numbers. So you guided – you kept the 3% to 5% for the year after the 0.8%, the 3% to 5% for – and you issued 3% to 5% guide for the second quarter, so is there some sort of expectation that you could be sort of the north end of that 3% to 5%, or a 4% to 6% in the back half to end up solidly in that 3% to 5% range. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, if we just – yeah, there would be some expectation towards the back half of the year that we would generate towards the upper end of that range. But we wouldn't have to generate much towards the upper end of that range to get in the 3% to 5% range for the year. But, yeah, there would have to be some of that. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. The other thing that I would point out, Chris, is our first quarter is our lightest quarter both from a daily sales volume and the number of stores in the comp base. So as we roll through the year each quarter, especially the second and third quarter count substantially more towards the full year. Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC Understood. Thanks very much, guys. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay, thanks, Chris. Operator Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Hi, I had a follow-up and then another question. Just to make sure I got – interpreted that right. So what you've seen so far in April is that you are actually in that 3% to 5% range? Just to make sure I got that clear, Greg. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, what I would say because we have a displacement of Easter coming into the second quarter. We had an uneven compare between the quarters as to where Easter fell in the years. So what I would say is that – and to quantify that for such a short period of time is a little bit difficult because you don't know what we would have done had we not had Easter this year. But what I would say is, is that we're pleased with the trend we're on and the trend that we're on would lead us to having confidence in achieving the 3% to 5% range for the second quarter. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI And it sounds like February – in terms of in the first quarter, February was a negative month and the other two were positive? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. That's correct. Yeah. January was positive. March was the best month of the period. February was negative, which is the first negative month that I remember for a while, but – and it wasn't just a little bit negative. It was a reasonable amount negative due to the two weeks in the middle of the month where the tax refund comparison was significant. And we had a couple of rough weeks there. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Got it. And so then my – the actual question I had was stepping back a little bit. Can you just remind us in terms of understanding the customer, trip down to DIY side, what sort of demographic they look like and taking the weather out of it, but just what sort of drives demand? How much of the business is cash business? I think I remember it being something like 30% compared to – it's a lot different than a lot of other retailers. So if you could help us understand that customer demographic in the tender form, I think, that will be helpful. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I'll make a few comments, and I think Tom wants to make a couple of comments. Our typical DIY consumer would be a lower income consumer who is driven to work on their own cars out of economic necessity. They're typically – we target generally speaking in our advertising efforts males from the age of 18 to 54 because they're typically the most driven to work on their own cars and try to do things that some may not try to do when it comes to DIY repair. But typically they're incentivized to work on their own car because of economic need and they're trying to avoid paying labor to shop to do so. And Tom, you may have something to... Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. On the question on tender. It's heavily cash and then when we look at cards presented, there are many more debit cards presented than actual credit cards. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI So, a majority of the DIY business is cash or just – is my 30%, a good guess or? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. I don't have the percentages sitting in front of me. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Okay. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. But if we take cash and debit cards, so it's coming straight out of the account. It's significantly higher than that. Greg Melich - Evercore ISI Got it. All right, thanks. I'll give someone else a shot. Good luck, guys. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin from BTIG. Please go ahead. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Thank you very much. So, Greg, your guidance of 3% to 5% comp in both 2Q and the full year certainly underscores your belief in the business. But is there anything incremental in the last quarter that leads you to believe that the competitive dynamic versus Amazon or e-commerce overall is any different than what you've said 90 days ago? And then I do have a follow-up. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. No, Alan, there's not been anything happen that would cause us to think that. As a matter of fact and really more because of the noise that has been generated with some of the analyst's reports and so forth. And I totally understand it relative to the disruption that some of the online retailers have caused with other brick-and-mortar retailers. I've spent some time talking to some of our supplier principals who might sell online retailers, which we obviously don't care for that that much. But still some of them that make sense for them to sell online retailers and work to protect the price at which the products are sold and so forth. But, and I think – I've known a lot of these guys for a long time and I have every reason to believe that they would shoot me straight relative to the amount of volume they do with some of these online retailers. I think that most of you would be really disappointed to hear what some of the suppliers that you might think would be major suppliers to online retailers, the amount of volume they're actually doing. And that volume is not on a ramp up that I think some of the commentary would lead people to believe. So while I – there's obviously products, especially accessories and some of the more ancillary products that go on cars, there's obviously a marketplace online that will serve them. But for the majority of our business in hard parts, I don't feel like that we're exposed much to online retailers and I don't see that changing in the short-term. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Okay. Thank you. And then my follow-up, Greg or Tom. So your guidance 90 days ago for the full year was $12.05 to $12.15, which you're now reiterating. What is the impact in the new number that you're issuing today, $12.05 to $12.15 from the change in the accounting principle? What will that number be for the full year? And then just to confirm, the Leap Day which cost you $25 million. That correlates to about 120 basis points. Would it be correct to assume that just that one factor alone would have led you to put up a 2% comp rather than 0.8%? Thank you. Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay. On the full-year guidance, obviously we were short of our expectations in the first quarter absent the comp change in accounting. However, when we look at our full year guidance and maybe I could have been clearer in the script, our full-year guidance includes the actual tax benefit experienced in the first quarter. So, we've got the headwind from the missed x (35:42), the change in accounting for options. We've got the positive from the options and we've got some positive in the last three quarters of the year for the shares we bought in the first quarter that weren't included really since our last conference call. So that's how we bridge back to the same EPS. So our expectation is that – or we have not given any guidance for what the gain will be from the new accounting for the rest of the year. And we'll obviously continue to report those separately. Same way we look at share repurchases. We will buy some shares back between now and the end of the year, but we don't include that in our guidance. On the second question, could you remind me of what that was? Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC The Leap Day. Did it cost you 120 basis points to the comp, Tom? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. It did not. Leap Day was excluded from our comp calculation last year. So when you look at the 6.1% comp we put up in the first quarter of 2016 that excluded Leap Day. When we talk about the total sales, obviously I denoted those in my script. That rolls into the total sales. And I think as we commented on last year's call, it was about that additional day has a great flow through because so many fixed costs, we don't pay more for the extra day within the month added about $0.05 to EPS last year. Alan Rifkin - BTIG LLC Okay. Thank you very much. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Alan. Operator Our next question comes from Kate McShane from Citi. Please go ahead. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you for taking my question. Not to beat a dead horse but I do believe there was some delay in the tax refund last year, certainly not to the extreme that we saw this year. Can you remind us what impact you saw last year as a result of that? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Tom, do you know the answer? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, we saw – last year when we look at February, and the tax return timing, we were also very fortunate that weather was very spring-like and we were able to capture quite a bit of that money when people had money in their pocket right away. Weather was beneficial to go out and work on your car which this year it was not, but we didn't quantify the exact number just saying that February was our strongest month last year. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. And do you have a sense of what the industry was down in February as a result this year? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. I think we'll anxiously await our other public competitors to report and take a look at that. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. And then just to wrap up this question. Just given the impact which seems to be much more negative for DIY in February, I assume the bigger lift that we will see for the rest of the year will be coming from DIY in your guidance? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. We would expect to continue to see some bounce back, but the weather factor, a cool winter and a late start to spring as Greg comments, you'll really weight on both sides of the business. Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Thank you. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Kate. Operator Our next question comes from Chris Bottiglieri from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Sure. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC One of your competitors referenced, I guess, the difference between national accounts and tire stores et cetera versus general repair shops. Have you seen anything similar in your business? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Jeff, you might have a comment on that, but I don't think we've seen much difference or any that would be significant. I think that all of us work to gain market share with the national accounts. And I don't think we noted a difference. Jeff, did you see anything? Jeff M. Shaw - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. No. No, I think the traffic would be fairly similar across those accounts. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Okay, that's helpful. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. I think generally speaking, across our business we saw the pressure from the milder winter which would not drive demand for the winter sensitive products, and then the late tax refunds during those weeks in February where that was comparison issues. Jeff M. Shaw - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. The other thing I might mention, Greg, is we have put more of a focus on the national accounts over the last couple of years and those accounts are still trending up with us. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, so we're gaining market share with those guys, yeah. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC That was actually my follow-up question and I'll hop-off. But, now that you're in the Northeast, now you clearly have planted more flags, you're coming from the Southeast, you truly are becoming more national. Can you talk about your conversations with some of those national installers and how those are changing given your increased presence? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I think we're doing a good job with them. We have got a team just like our competitors do that focuses on developing relationships and establishing purchasing relationships with those guys and, yeah, we feel like we're doing well. We feel like we're gaining market share on that side of the business. Some of it you want and obviously some of it our competitors want worse and they might sell them at a price that we might not be willing to. But in many cases we're able to get the business. And long-term the people that run the individual shops are looking for the best service providers. So I think that more often than not we win on service but you first have to have a relationship with the company that enables the systems to be integrated for ease and processing transactions at the shop. And we've gained some market share there the last couple of years and would expect over the next few years as we become more national by having a significant presence in the Northeast that we'll do better with those types of businesses. Chris Bottiglieri - Wolfe Research LLC Got you. Thanks. Good luck next quarter. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay, thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks, good morning. So March and April, clearly, picked up and it sounds like some of it was tax refund. But I guess what gives you confidence that we're just not seeing the other side of it now, meaning there was some pent up demand? And then could April's run rate be influenced by that, in other words, what makes you feel or is there any evidence to give you confidence that this is a new sustainable run rate and not just a bounce back from some pent up demand? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, Simeon, what I would say is just that the things that in the past we've looked at that have been drivers of demand or have been detractors from demand. Those fundamental factors are positive right now. And so all the things that we would look at that would indicate industry demand should be healthier, maybe not so healthy, they're all healthy right now. So I think that we have to feel like that generally speaking demand this year would be reasonably good. Now, that's not to say that our crystal ball is any better than yours, but we have been in this business a long time and have seen the ups and downs with the different vehicle population, gas prices, miles driven, things like that. And all those things are positive, indicating that demand should be good. So while there's no question that there could be some benefit to deferred maintenance and repairs from maybe the March weather and so forth that could have pushed business into late March or early April. It's hard for us not to feel like the fundamental drivers of demand in our business are very positive and we would expect the year for our industry to be a reasonably positive year. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Right. And I think though you mentioned you are seeing, I don't know if it's spring-related or early summer-related or spring-related business start to come into the mix. I don't know if that could be an indication of it. I don't know if I caught that earlier on the call. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I mean, we're – in most markets we're into spring time and we're starting to see the DIY maintenance type business that you would see and the shops are busier. We work very close with many of the shops that we partner with, and the shops businesses are picking up as they do every spring. And so yeah, we're seeing more typical spring time demand, early spring time demand as we would see every spring right now. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. And just my follow-up is just on inflation. We hear from some of the oil companies are starting to see price increases, I think fuel's been inflationary. Are you seeing any signs on the input side three months, six months, a year out from now? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Greg, you may have a comment on that just from a supplier pricing standpoint, and then Tom, you can speak to it from a raw inflation standpoint. Gregory D. Johnson - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, I mean, a lot of our commodities do fluctuate based on oil, for example, metals, things like that. So we do typically see fluctuation in prices based on lead pricing for batteries, things like that. We have seen some movement in base oil pricing over the past quarter and – but we don't – you never know what the future brings, but we feel like we've taken the bulk of that or at least we hope we have in the first quarter. And we've been able to pass some of that along, some of it we're still looking into (44:55). Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. When we look from a macro standpoint across all our products we continue to expect to have more LIFO pressures. We're going to have a similar number here in the second quarter we saw in the first quarter, those deals have already been inked. Could have come back a little bit from increases in oil, yeah, but we have pretty good visibility going forward. And we'd expect to continue to see in aggregate minor LIFO pressures, again, in the third and fourth quarters built into our guidance. Simeon Ari Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Okay. Thank you. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks. Operator Our next question comes from Bret Jordan from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Hey, good morning, guys. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Good morning. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Could you talk a bit about regional performance too, I guess given the fact that some of that mild weather more significantly impacted Northern states. Are you seeing the correlation in weather in the various markets? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Well, yeah, I mean, we definitely had disparity on our regional performance. What we would say is that the markets that we would consider to be weather affected versus the markets that would be maybe not weather affected. And that's not a clear line, but we do our best to draw that line. That difference will be just slightly less of 400 basis points of difference. What I would tell you is that in the first quarter, our Western stores performed materially better than the East Coast stores relative to that because the East Coast stores are, obviously, more sensitive to weather and the West Coast stores less. Although for some period of time in the West, they had torrential rains that were impacting the business. I think we would have done a lot better out West if it hadn't been for the significant rainstorms that they had. But still even with that the West performed better than the East and the North of course. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Okay. And then a question, I guess, sort of housekeeping. The first quarter, obviously the earnings were within the guide but had the not operating positive, but you kept the EBIT margin guide constant for the year. So, I guess you must have some confidence that the operating improves? I guess, Tom, that was more tax impact on the stock based accounting not EBIT impact? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. That's correct. We still feel like with the comp range that we're anticipating and the SG&A spend we're anticipating and the gross margin. We're going to continue to be in the same operating margin range and don't feel the need to change it. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Great. If I can squeeze a quick one in, on the Bond stores you announced that the integration is progressing. Could you give us any color on how those stores are performing? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. We're happy with them. I would say that they're comparable from just a sales cadence standpoint to the stores that we have in the Northeast that have been somewhat weather affected, but yeah, we're happy with them. They're great teams at those stores. They're going to do much better with our inventory assortment and availability of our Devens distribution center inventory mix, which is a substantial increase in SKU count from what they were supplied by before. So, yeah, we're happy with them and we think they should continue to do well. The conversion just took place last weekend so they now have all of the availability tools that we will ultimately provide them and as they get used to that and trained in using those we would expect this to be a great summer and fall for them. Bret Jordan - Jefferies LLC Great. Thank you very much. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Bret. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Dan Wewer from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Yeah. Thanks. Greg, wanted to ask if there were any company-specific issues that adversely impacted sales in the first quarter or competitive changes. The reason I'm asking is the comp sales gap between O'Reilly and NAPA narrowed in the period compared to past levels. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. One would think that the tax refunds and so forth impacted both companies about the same. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. What I would tell you, Dan, is that there's not a day goes by that I don't have a conversation with someone hear about something, I think, could improve. And the job that Greg and Jeff and Tom and the rest our executive team do is that same way. We're very critical of ourselves. So what I would tell you is that we always feel like that we have opportunities to improve but there's been nothing changed relative to the opportunities that we have to improve relative to what we see at our competitors and the gap that should exist as a result of that. So I think my answer is no there's been no significant change and I wouldn't reflect our underperformance on comps in the first quarter to anything company specific here, although we always see opportunities to improve. We spend a week every year gathering input from our field as to the things that they feel like we can improve on and the competitive pressures that they might feel, and then we bring all of our executives together every year and come up with solutions to those and put a plan in place, and how we're going to resolve and correct those things. And it's just been a focus from way back when they were a private company and the family owned the business they did that, and we've continue to do that as a publicly traded company. And we feel like it serves us well. So do we have our opportunities? You bet we do. Do we feel like we're the best in the industry at what we do? Yeah we do. I think what we do is pretty incredible and I don't think there's been anything changed on that front. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. And also Tom, I wanted to follow up on Bret's question about the EBIT guidance. Given the share count that you're using now for the annual EPS forecast and excluding the lower tax rate, is it fair to say that your EBIT guidance towards that low end of that range of 20.1% instead of the mid or higher end? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. When you work through the math of where we are and kind of look at our guidance through the end of the year, we're going to be pressured below the midpoint at this point. Obviously, our goal is to get it back up to the midpoint. Dan R. Wewer - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Okay. Great, thank you. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Thanks, Dan. Operator Our next question comes from Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Thanks so much and good morning. I have two questions. The first is a financial one probably for Tom. If you could update us on what you're thinking is for the impact of LIFO on a full-year basis, I think at the end of Q4 you indicated that it would be about half of what it was in 2016. So is that still the case? And also just to clarify when you talked about half the impact was that essentially in total dollar terms? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah, we were looking at – when we started the year we were looking at a LIFO impact between $20 million and $25 million for this year. I'd say based on having a higher first quarter number than we anticipated, which we talked about, we'd be in the higher end of that range. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. But still directionally if you were $49 million last year kind of the mid-$20s million is still a reasonable place to think about? Thomas G. McFall - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yes, sir. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Got it. And then secondly, curious what you are seeing in your own online efforts in terms of DIY and commercial, whether one piece of the business or another is gaining more traction? And what you see consumers responding to as you test and learn about what the appeal is, and the desires from your customers to interact with you online? Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Yeah. Matt, this is Greg. From a B2B standpoint, we call our product First Call Online, which as you may know a lot of our Professional businesses done under the name of First Call for the most part. That business is awesome. We've do a – we've done an incredible job for a long time incentivizing and getting use from our professional customers of our B2B platform, which can work as a browser based product or it can be and is integrated in with many of the shop management systems. And a lot of our orders come from our customers via that platform and that's a growing platform that we'll continue to grow as we continue to enhance it with better features and benefits as we move forward. On the DIY side, we have a substantial business but we feel like we could do better. And we've got a lot of work underway right now to re-platform both our website and our mobile site to do some things that we would like it to do that we think would be more customer friendly. As online retail has been talked about, it's hard for us not to think that we would be – if customers are going to buy wiper blades, for instance, or an accessory, or something like that, that we might stock or have available from someone online. I mean, who better to buy it from with the 27 distribution centers across the country that know these products and can help them with these products. So we've got a substantial effort underway right now to improve our B2C business. And like I said, we have business, it's a nice business, but we feel like we could do more than what we are doing. And more than anything we view ourselves as building an omni-channel business, so that our customers when they go on our website or our mobile site see the same O'Reilly Auto Parts that they would see if they walked into one of our stores. So that's a significant project for us right now. And when I talk about the strategic goals that we have for the year that we set each year that I mentioned in response to one of the questions a moment ago that's one of our strategic goals. I think that if you look at our site a year from now you would be impressed with what it looks like then as compared to what it looks like now. And now it's pretty good, but I think it can be a lot better. Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks so much, Greg. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. You bet. Thank you, Matt. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes – we have reached our allotted time for questions. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Greg Henslee for closing remarks. Gregory L. Henslee - O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. Okay, thanks, Victoria. We'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire O'Reilly Team for their diligent customer service in the first quarter. We remain extremely confident in our ability to continue to aggressively and profitably gain market share for the remainder of 2017. I would like to thank, everyone, for joining our call today and we look forward to reporting our 2017 second quarter results in July. Thank you. Operator Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

And now I'd like to introduce The Priceline Group's speakers for this afternoon, Glenn Fogel and Daniel Finnegan. Go ahead, gentlemen. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Thank you very much, and welcome to The Priceline Group's First Quarter Conference Call. I am joined this afternoon by our Chief Financial Officer, Dan Finnegan. The Priceline Group performed well in the first quarter reporting year-over-year room night growth of 27%. Consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter were approximately $20.7 billion, up about 24% year-over-year or about 27% on a constant currency basis. Gross profit was up about 16%, or about 17% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share were $9.11, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $9.88, up 7% versus the prior year, surpassing the high end of our guidance. Looking at the group brand by brand, Booking.com executed another solid quarter with strong top line growth. Booking.com's total property count now stands at over 1.2 million, which represents a year-over-year increase of 36%. The Booking.com platform now includes approximately 640,000 instantly bookable vacation rental properties, which is a year-over-year growth rate of 51%. This very strong growth rate demonstrates Booking's focus on rapidly growing its non-hotel accommodation inventory. We believe adding these types of properties creates a more robust marketplace and provides real choice for our customers. Our service is differentiated because all properties are instantly bookable, and we do not charge fees to our travelers. Overall, Booking.com's hotel and non-hotel properties represent a combined total of approximately 25.5 million potentially bookable rooms. Of this total, 17.5 million are within our traditional hotel partners, and 8 million are bookable rooms in our homes, apartments, villas and other non-hotel categories. In our rental cars product, the group grew rental car days 15% in the quarter, which marks the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth, and the fastest growth rate since the second quarter of 2015. This growth was driven primarily by Rentalcars.com as they continue to make smart investments in product innovation and customer service. Improving trends at priceline.com also contributed to the acceleration in rental car days growth for the quarter. Turning to priceline.com overall, we are pleased to see the team make progress in Q1 as priceline.com began to see benefits from their investments in technology and people. These investments have resulted in improvement to product, user interface, and experiment velocity, and shows that priceline.com is relentlessly focused on delivering the very best deals to its customers. We believe that these efforts along with priceline.com's new best deal brand campaign which highlights its consumer value proposition will drive further improvements. Regarding KAYAK, it delivered attractive profit margins in Q1 and continued to invest in usability improvements, mobile enhancements, and new product development. We expect such investments will enable KAYAK to differentiate itself in the marketplace and grow its audience. As to the Momondo transaction, we reiterate our previous public statement that we expect to close the transaction later in the year pending successful completion of the regulatory review. Now agoda which posted another quarter of strong gross bookings growth with the direct channel growing nicely and increasing share versus the paid channels. agoda continues to innovate and invest in its merchant supply platform and experiment with closed-user group and other discount offerings to enable it to compete in its core APAC markets where the use of discounted rates is a more common practice. Finally, OpenTable produced another solid quarter of healthy diner reservation growth, beating expectations on both the top and bottom line. OpenTable made further progress upgrading restaurants from its legacy electronic reservation book system to its cloud based guest center service which enables OpenTable to easily introduce system changes and improvements. OpenTable has maintained a fast pace of innovation, recently launching a chat extension feature in Facebook messenger. While it is still very early days for this product, we are pleased that OpenTable continues to be at the forefront of new technologies. In summary, I am pleased with the group's performance in the first quarter, but we cannot rest. We are now beginning to prepare for our busy third quarter and are continuously working to improve our services to ensure a successful upcoming high travel season. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication, our supplier partners, and most importantly, our customers. Finally, I would like to share some news with you, which is that Dan Finnegan, who most of you know by now or at least you know his voice, since this is his 33rd earnings call, has announced that now in his 14th year of dedicated service to The Priceline Group, is going to be retiring. Now, he's not going anywhere just yet. But we will be starting a formal search for the company's new CFO. Dan will remain as CFO for as long as needed until we find the right person and have completed a smooth transition. But we wanted to let you all know about the proposed plans. And I want to take this moment to personally, and on behalf of more than 18,000 employees, to thank Dan for all he has done for The Priceline Group. Dan, thank you for everything. I will now turn the call over to you for your 33rd detailed financial review. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Thanks, Glenn. I'll discuss operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide guidance for the second quarter of 2017. All growth rates referenced in my comments are relative to the prior-year comparable period unless otherwise indicated. I highlight that as we have discussed for several quarters now, the non-GAAP figures for our Q1 results and Q2 forecast includes stock-based compensation, and do not reflect a reduction to income tax expense related to available NOLs. The reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is detailed in our earnings release. 2017 is off to a strong start. Room nights booked in Q1 grew by 27% despite a challenging prior year growth comp. We estimate that the shift of Easter into Q2 had a slightly beneficial impact on Q1 gross bookings growth with an offsetting negative impact to Q2 gross bookings growth which I will discuss further in a moment. The Q1 impact is offset by Q1 prior-year's extra day for leap year. Performance was strong across each of our key geographic regions, and we believe we grew our market share in the U.S. and internationally through outstanding organic execution by our brands. Rental car day growth also accelerated to 15% in Q1 compared to 14% in Q4. Average daily rates for accommodations or ADRs were up about 1% for Q1 versus prior year on a constant currency basis for the consolidated group which was consistent with our forecast. Foreign exchange rates unfavorably impacted growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for our Q1 results as compared to the prior year. Q1 gross bookings grew by 24% expressed in U.S. dollars and grew by about 27% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for the quarter for The Priceline Group was $2.3 billion and grew by 16% in U.S. dollars and by about 17% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of gross bookings for Q1 is 84 bps lower than prior year Q1. The decrease is due largely to booked-versus-stay time lag, impacted by Easter shifting to Q2 this year and an expanding booking window. Other contributing factors to the variance are discounted closed user group rates and business mix. The shift of Easter from Q1 last year to Q2 this year also negatively impacts Q1 gross profit, operating profit, EBITDA, net income, and profit margins, and will benefit those metrics in Q2, in both cases compared to the prior year. Our international operations generated gross profit of $2 billion which grew by 17% in U.S. dollars and by about 19% on a constant currency basis compared to prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations amounted to $315 million which grew about 6% compared to the prior year. Advertising and other revenue, which is mainly comprised of non-intercompany revenues for KAYAK and OpenTable, grew by 8% in Q1 compared to the prior year. Margin performance was better than our forecast due to gross profit growth and advertising efficiency that exceeded our forecast. The timing of investments in non-ad OpEx was also favorable to forecast. GAAP operating income grew by 1% and GAAP operating margins decreased by 341 bps compared to Q1 last year, due mainly to performance advertising. Performance advertising deleverage was impacted mainly by the timing of bookings versus stays that I just discussed and strong growth in performance advertising channels. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $635 million which exceeded the top end of our guidance range of $580 million and grew by 4% versus prior year. GAAP net income and fully diluted EPS both increased by 22%. Non-GAAP net income per share was $9.88, up 7% versus the prior year, exceeding our guidance for the quarter and FactSet consensus of $8.82. Our non-GAAP tax rate of about 16% was favorable to our forecasted rate of 19%, mainly due to nonrecurring discrete tax adjustments in the quarter. In terms of cash flow, we generated $381 million of cash from operations during first quarter 2017 which is an increase of about 10%. We made a pre-payment of income taxes in the Netherlands in Q1 to earn a pre-payment discount, which negatively impacts operating cash flow for Q1 but will benefit subsequent quarters when the taxes would've otherwise been due. During the quarter, we returned $212 million to our shareholders through share buybacks. In March, we raised €1 billion of cash for our U.S. parent company by offering a five-year bond in Europe at a 0.8% interest rate. Our cash and investments amounted to $15.5 billion at March 31, 2017, with about $2.3 billion of that balance in the U.S. Now for Q2 guidance. We are forecasting booked room nights to grow by 16% to 21% and total gross bookings to grow by 12% to 17% in U.S. dollars and by 15% to 20% on a constant currency basis. Our Q2 forecast assumes that constant currency accommodation ADRs for the consolidated group will be up by about 1% compared to the prior-year period. As mentioned a moment ago, seasonal factors added to growth in Q1 and are forecasted to pressure growth in Q2. We are comfortable with the combined forecasted growth rate for the first half of the year, which we believe is reflective of generally healthy macro travel trends and implies a continuation of market share gains evident in our reported Q1 results. We forecast gross profit to grow by 14% to 19% in U.S. dollars and by 17% to 22% on a constant currency basis. GAAP operating margins expressed as operating income as a percentage of gross profit are expected to be lower than prior-year Q2 by about 140 bps. Our Q2 forecast assumes year-over-year pressure on performance marketing ROIs and that paid channel growth will continue to be strong. Our forecast also reflects brand advertising and non-advertising expenses as we invest towards high travel season and innovation to drive future growth. Q2 adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $860 million and $905 million, which at the midpoint is up 9% versus prior year. EBITDA growth and margins are impacted by the factors I just discussed for GAAP operating profit. We forecast GAAP EPS between $12.55 to $13.25 per share for Q2, which, at the midpoint, is up by about 11% versus prior year. Our EPS guidance includes interest expense on our recent bond issuance and assumes a fully diluted share count of 50.1 million shares, which reflects the beneficial impact of the common stock repurchases we have made to-date, offset by additional equivalent shares related to our convertible bonds due to the increase in our stock price. We are forecasting Q2 non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $13.30 to $14 per share which at the midpoint is up by about 8% versus prior year. Our forecasted non-GAAP income tax rate is about 18% for Q2 and the full year. Our Q2 forecast is based upon recent foreign exchange rates and assumes that our growth rates in U.S. dollars will be negatively impacted by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Consistent with past practice, we have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any further fluctuation in the Euro, British pound, and various other currencies versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. Our forecast does not assume any significant change or macroeconomic conditions in general, or in the travel market in particular. As Glenn just mentioned, I have decided that now in my 14th year with the company, the time is right to start working towards my retirement. Equally importantly I think the time is also right for the company. We are in great hands with Glenn and our brand CEOs running the business. Our brand CFOs and my headquarters finance team are world class and will keep doing great work as we transition to a new Priceline Group CFO. I will stay with the company as long as necessary to help recruit my successor and to ensure a smooth transition. I thank all my colleagues around the world for their incredible accomplishments over these many years. It has been a dream come true to be part of such a wonderful team. And we will now take your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. This is Dae Lee in for Doug Anmuth. Thank you for taking the question. First question on gaining share in the U.S. How much of that do you think is taking share from competitors versus adding new properties like vacation rentals? And my second question on share buyback, could you please update us on how you're strategically thinking about buybacks and what could cause that to change? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Thank you, David for Doug, I believe. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC Dae Lee in for Doug. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Let me take – I'm going to take the second one about the share buyback question, and I'll let Dan talk about the first one. We believe we'll be consistent going forward the same way we have been in the past regarding share buyback. We are opportunistic. We recognize shareholders want us to use our cash effectively, efficiently, and appropriately. So as opportunities are there, we will be buying share back, but we do it in a measured way. I think the best way to look forward is to see how we've done over the last few years and consider that as guidance for going forward. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And as far as share in the U.S., Dae Lee, we look at the market – we attempt to size the market based upon the properties that we have on our extranet. So there's over 1.2 million properties on Booking.com today. We know the number of rooms that are in those properties, and so we look at that as a proxy for the market. That includes vacation rentals. So in our room nights booked also include vacation rentals. So we see them as basically interchangeable with hotels and other types of properties as places where people want to stay when they travel and we want to give them the maximum number of choices. So looking at it that way, we can see our growth in total, we still have a relatively low share of the worldwide market single digits. And we can also see our growth for the U.S. market relative to the market's growth and relative to what other players have reported, including our biggest other online travel competitor. And we feel that we're gaining share based upon those metrics. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two-part single question. It's under the U.S. Booking.com on the vacation rentals, you have had really good progress there the last year or so, arguably even more than that. I guess I'd be curious if you could just talk about kind of the one or two areas you really look to improve in the U.S. Booking.com and vacation rentals to kind of further drive growth. What would those one or two areas be? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, Brian, as I think the way you asked that question, vacation rentals, I'm going to talk about that in general and not narrow it to any specific geography. We believe it is a very important growth area for us. We've been involved with it for some time. We continue to grow it as I mentioned about 41% increase in the instantly bookable vacation rental properties. We are very pleased with the way we do the business, and that is we don't charge those travelers fees. And as I said, these are all instantly bookable. We think that's an advantage. One of the things we need to continue to do is get even more properties. When you look at some of our competitors they have more properties, and breadth is an important thing to make sure that we have the availability, the right properties at the right price for our customers. So we're going to continue to do that. We also need to make sure that all people are aware that this is a great product. I think that it's not unknown that we do not have the same awareness. There's not the same awareness of our vacation rental property, particularly in the U.S., as some other competitors have. So we need to make sure that everyone knows that we've got a great product there too. And your other question was? Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC It's on the U.S. Booking.com. Kind of just – same kind of question where you've done really well. But if you can kind of point to one or two areas where you say here is some low hanging fruit we could still improve. What would those be? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, I think that we continue to do the same formula that we have done throughout the history of our company and it has helped us get to the level of success that we are. It's not one or two. There is make sure we have breadth of property, make sure we have best price, make sure we have the way a customer goes through our path is the easiest best way for somebody to do it. Be sure that we are offering them in the way they want it. If they want to reserve a property and not have to pay until they show up at the property, we offer that. If they want to pay up-front, we need to be able to offer that. And we have different brands that offer different ways to do it. In fact, most of them offer both ways, though not for all properties. I think in the end, it's just continuing to crank out the same formula we've had in the past, maintain good relationships with the suppliers to make sure we're offering them a great relationship, and we will continue to grow as we have grown in the past. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great. Thank you. Sorry to see you leaving, Dan. I hope it's – I hope you stay for a while. A few questions on guidance. I guess first of all, just help us put the 8% earnings growth in context. It seems like a pretty healthy macro, and an easier comp. And then I think on the prepared remarks you said expect some ROI pressure. I believe on the last call, you indicated that kind of ROI pressure was lessening. Has there been a real change there that's going on? And then maybe did you put your usual amount of conservatism in 2Q guidance given the late – how it's back-end loaded? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Justin. Well, first of all, for the guidance. No change in approach. Same approach that we've used every quarter. It's a little bit different, in that there's volatility in the early part of the quarter here because of the shift of Easter, and so that makes things a little bit more difficult. I'd say that the market remains healthy. We see occupancy in ADRs are strong. The seasonal impact has certainly negatively impacted growth for Q2. We think the booking window expansion that we have been talking about for a couple of years now is probably all else being equal moving some bookings that would have been made in the past in Q2 into Q1, and even into Q4 as people are booking early. If you look at the midpoint of our room-night guide for Q2 together with our actual results for Q1, it would imply a 23% growth rate, which would compare – it takes the seasonality out of it, with the shift of the hotel or booking window, a shift of Easter timing or booking window. So that 23% growth would compare to a 27% growth for the first half of last year, which we're comfortable with that. We think that's very solid performance. We expect the business to decelerate structurally given the size of it and the long-term trends that we have seen over many years. The growth may decelerate more in certain quarters. We have accelerated in certain quarters. But overall, for the long-term, our growth has been very resilient. It's been a pleasant surprise. The growth drivers that drive – have driven our growth in the past are still there, so the secular shift from offline to online continues. We still have a single-digit share of a very big market, so there's a lot of opportunity to continue to add properties and to continue to penetrate the properties we have more deeply. Our teams are adding properties at a very healthy rate, as Glenn talked about, and we're working every day to continuously improve conversion on our websites. And then we have maintained a very consistent approach to advertising: no change in our approach, no change in competitive position that we can detect. So we continue to invest in reasonable ROIs to drive a healthy mix of top line growth and profitability. The 8% growth in guidance for EBITDA is a function of that top line growth that we talked about and then just the margin pressure that we're guiding to in the quarter, which is less than what we've seen over many of the last quarters where we've guided, and the drivers are pretty much every line item. So we are assuming that there will be more ROI pressure in Q2, but what I said last quarter, that overall we think for the first half of this year the margin pressure from performance marketing will be less than what we experienced in the back half of last year, I stay with that statement. I still feel comfortable with that. And then we're also investing in brand advertising as we're in peak booking season getting ready for peak travel season, and we're investing in OpEx for our brands, customer service people, property people to continue to sign new properties and continue our growth in the future. And then IT people that are working on innovative projects and just keeping up with the growth in the business. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. You may begin. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. First, congratulations, Dan. That's a phenomenal 33-quarter stretch both fundamentally and obviously in terms of the stock. So congratulations on that. Two questions, please. First, you talked about an expanding bookings window. Is that – as you mix-shift more and more away from hotels to non-hotels and vacation rentals, alternative accommodations, is that just a natural outflow of that that will bring you expanded bookings? And then I think you may have just covered this a little bit in Justin's question, but I'll try it again. The advertising efficiency that exceeded your forecast in the March quarter, was there something – anything new to particular to call out there? Anything that suggests that you'll sustainably improve advertising efficiencies? Or do you think that there was kind of one-time-ish kind of items? Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Mark. Regarding the expanding booking window, I would attribute that more to people continuing to repeat with our business, becoming familiar with the model, with strong occupancy rates and rising ADRs, looking to book farther in advance and feeling comfortable doing that because they know we have a very flexible model and if their plans change later they're able to change their booking. So I think that's the more fundamental driver there. That I would expect to continue. If there were some significant change in macro or maybe people felt less comfortable about whether or not they were going to travel economically or the ADRs were dropping, maybe they would change their behavior. But it would still be a free option to make a booking and then if prices drop you can change your booking later. So I think that's what's driving that. And then ad efficiency was pretty solid in Q1. It's a mix of what's going on at all of our brands. So we have some brands like KAYAK and agoda leaning a little bit more heavily into brand advertising or discounting to drive demand to their websites. There's still underlying ROI pressure, in general, and it's the trend we've seen for many years now. I would expect to see that going forward too, Mark, until we don't see it for an extended period of time. I would just build that into the forecast. It's what we have built into our forecast for Q2. And so that's what's built in there. I wouldn't – there's nothing that I have seen that would lead me to believe that there's a sustainable ability for ROIs to improve year-over-year. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you, Dan. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks, Dan. You actually kind of touched on this a little bit in response to Mark's question but just kind of curious how we should be thinking about the tradeoff between growth and margins going forward. I understand that the performance advertising line is going to be the biggest variable there, but you guys are clearly outgrowing the industry but we also have seen about 300 basis points of compression so far this year. And it seems to be about that implied in your Q2 guidance. Is that the right kind of run rate in terms of what's necessary to grow bookings and revenues or gross profit at this level given where the macro environment is? Or is there a better way to think of that? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. I see a little less margin pressure than what you're talking about for Q2, Heath, unless you're adjusting for Easter timing. But then there would be less pressure in Q1. So, yeah, I'm seeing more like 150 bps for GAAP operating margins. It's always a balance between top line growth and bottom line growth. We try to strike a balance. From time to time, we see opportunities to invest in brand advertising. We think that's a good thing to do for our business for the long-term. There are OpEx investments that we've come across in the past, things like investing in mobile which have been critical to the success of the business. If you go back to 2012, we were a business that was generating room night reservations of 200 million and over the last 12 months we're more like 600 million room nights. So I think those investments have paid off and we're going to try to make start investments for the future. We're always looking to manage those expenses as closely as we can and with a fast-growing business we generally expect that we can make the investments that we need to make and not have pressure on margins from non-ad OpEx. But from time to time where we see the opportunity, we won't let short-term margin objectives do something that might be detrimental to the long-term growth of the business. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then I guess just on the alternative accommodations business. How much of an advantage, at least when it comes to gaining share and traction in that space, do you feel like your fee-free model for consumers is for you relative to most of the other competitors in this space who are charging consumer-facing fees at this point? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. It's Glenn speaking. Well, that's a difficult question to answer in terms of how we're doing versus the competitors given some are private and don't reveal how fast they're growing. I can only attest to our growth rate. And while we don't give out specific different types of growth rates for our different types of properties, I'm comfortable saying that, in the area you're talking about, that is growing faster than the overall average for the entire company. So we are pleased with that stronger growth rate in that area. We believe and our DNA is experiment and test. If we thought another way was better, we would do it that way. We are pleased with the way we're doing it. And we think in the long run this will be the winner. And one piece of evidence that I point to is I notice some of our competitors who have been shifting to our method of instantly bookable and talking about how fast they're going to be able to get those to be instantly bookable. So I think that would kind of indicate that other people believe that this is the better route. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question and congrats, Dan, on the decision. Maybe focusing back on driving engagement with your return customers, I want to understand a little bit about where you're allocating capital either in remarketing to bookers or maybe even the Genius program and how you're thinking about the returns that driving second and third direct traffic back to the site might change some of the marketing efficiency long-term? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Hi. So we don't disclose repeat rates, nor do we disclose how much money we're devoting to remarketing. So a lot of the data you would like to hear, unfortunately I can't share that with you. I can share with you, though, how important we believe repeat business is. And the way you get repeat business isn't just marketing type stuff. What you have to do is provide a great booking experience for the customer. That's something that we think we have done no matter which way they're doing it, whether they're doing it online, or mobile. We believe that we provide a great service to our customers and that's why they come back. A couple other reasons. One that I think is so important is customer service. We spend a lot of money on customer service, and right now in this quarter we're hiring customer service people to be prepared for that very, very important third quarter high season. We have to do that right and we need the people to do that. We need to train them now so they will perform well in that high-season period. Because good customer service is where you get loyalty. It doesn't have to be anything that's screwed up in the booking of it. If the customer has a problem, we want to be able to help them out, no matter what the situation is. That's how we build loyalty, and I think that's one of the reasons for our strong growth. And I can give lots of anecdotes, but I won't. But I know we've reached out and we've helped our customers a great deal and I think that's one of the great reasons that we're being successful. Operator Thank you. Our next question... Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Does that help? Operator Comes from Mark May with Citi. You may begin. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. I know that vacation rentals have been a meaningful contributor to room-night growth recently, but I think you recently stated that you're not only in the early process of adding inventory there, but that you haven't maybe promoted it as much as you would like to your users. And just a question is what are your plans for enhancing the promotion of this offering to your users? And then secondly, another question in terms of the advertising, performance advertising leverage. Is there anything that you're seeing, either in the market externally or things that you're doing internally driven, where you actually think that you could actually see some leverage in ad spend in the near to medium term. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. So I'll take the first one, and Dan will take the second one. I agree with that statement that not as many people know about our great product as I would like, because I'd like everybody to know about it. Now, in terms of your question about how we're going to make more people be aware of our vacation-rental business, we are acting, we are working on it, and we are coming up with plans. But I think the last thing I want to do is reveal what our plans are to our competitors and how we're going to make more people aware that we do have this great product. So I'm going to have to pass on actually giving away the plans on how we're going to make people aware of our product. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And then performance advertising leverage, Mark, it's all the factors you mentioned. So it's what's happening with external players, what we're doing internally, again trying to strike a balance between top line growth and bottom line growth. So we're pushing into channels where we think we can do that efficiently. There's also the manner in which the auction is run by the advertiser, and we're balancing all of those to try and strike a good balance. What I answered earlier to somebody else's question, I wouldn't forecast that there's going to be leverage in performance marketing. I would have to see that for a number of quarters and have some reason to expect it to continue before I would build that into a forecast. While we have had quarters here and there where the leverage story on performance marketing has been better, in general now for many years, all the way back to 2012, it's been a source of margin pressure. And I've seen it as a source of margin pressure in other players in our space too. In fact, to a greater degree on their margins than what we've experienced with ours. So I feel comfortable that we are continuing to expand our lead in a very competitive marketplace, and performance marketing has been the most important tool that we have used to try and drive traffic to our website over our history and build our brands. We're improving our capabilities with brand advertising, and we look to deploy money there too where we think we can get a reasonable return. Even if it's over a longer period of time because there's typically a lag there between when you spend and then the benefit that you get by having more brand awareness and having people potentially come to you directly, which would improve the performance advertising metrics. And maybe even just cause them to search for our brand or a higher propensity to click on our brand when they search in other paid channels. So I think there's opportunities for us from time to time to invest a little bit more heavily in brand advertising and that would help, but I wouldn't forecast performance advertising leverage until we see that happening. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations, Dan. I was hoping you can provide some color on the puts and takes that drove the lower year-over-year agency take rates. I think some of that is from the Easter shift, but hoping that you can elaborate. And then the second question is I was hoping that you'd provide color on why meta-search is becoming so strategically important across the industry? Is it because of Trivago's growth? Is it because of the breakdown of rate parity? Or are there some other reasons for just the strategic importance of meta-search? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Why don't I take that second one first, and Dan can take the first one. So meta is important. We have KAYAK. We're pleased with their performance. And there are others, like you mentioned Trivago. But I'd caution you when I say how important it is, I'm not sure it's a qualitative term, not a quantitative term. I'd like to point out that our overall business through meta is still a relatively small amount. So I wouldn't overemphasize it. It's important but I wouldn't overemphasize it. Why is it growing? Why do people like to use it? I could give some potential reasons of people enjoy to be able to see multiple price properties there with different prices so they can see is this the best price or not. And then they can go off to a place like Booking.com or Priceline or agoda and do the actual booking. But the why side of the point to us is making sure that we're there. We try and run our business so we are aware of where the customer wants to be. And customers who want to use meta, we have a great product there for them. And that's how we do it. It's us not trying to tell the customer you should use this; it's us making sure we have the best product service available for that customer who wants to use it. And I think that's the best way to look at it. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And, Paul, your assumption was correct on the agency take rate. So you're looking at agency gross profit divided by agency gross bookings. That's down because of the Easter shift. The fundamental take rates are very, very stable. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. You may begin. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats, Dan. I just had two questions. One was a follow-up on the earlier question about repeat users. So have some of those efforts that Glenn mentioned to drive repeats, are those metrics actually improving? Or do you guys kind of view this as a space where the potential around repeat, given the low frequency of purchases, just may not be there? Or is there a penetration rate that you think the industry needs to be at where, you know, repeat – organic repeat can be a source of leverage at some point down the road? And then the second question is, any color on Facebook's new retargeting product for travel? I know you guys have been testing it. How has that been going? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. It's Glenn speaking. So going back on that repeat. I think, you know, the way we answered it pretty much answered as much as we can say. Although I will add that we are very pleased with our repeat rate. And I'm not going to give out a repeat number, but I'd caution everybody in trying to think they know what it is. So I just want to caution you on that. The second thing which I didn't mention about repeat, which I think is an important factor, is providing that great service and having them come back is something that not only helps us with that person, but there's that ability for people to be talking about what a good service it is. So you get another benefit in that word-of-mouth type advertising that's also very helpful and very powerful. So we agree repeat is very important. We work to make sure we give a good service. We want them to have that good service, and then there's an echo effect on it going forward. In regards to Facebook, we have mentioned earlier several times that we are working with Facebook, trying to improve the way to get more business out of Facebook. We have people who are dedicated to working with Facebook to create this because we pointed out we would like to spend a lot more money with Facebook. But as Dan has pointed out and we've talked about a lot in the past, we try to be very disciplined about our marketing expense and we want to get the appropriate ROI. So we need to come up with tools and ways to get and products – ways that Facebook will give us a good return on our spend. When that happens, we are ready, willing, able to spend a lot of money with them to find another way to get customers. Is that helpful? Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. You may begin. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations, Dan. Two please if I may. Can you provide any color in terms of any potential impact you saw to inbound travel to the U.S. as a result of the current administration's rhetoric and attempted travel bans? And could you also provide any color on broader macro or regional trends you have seen through the first five weeks or so of 2Q? Any notable changes to call out? Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. I'll just take the first part, and Dan can talk about the second part. Regarding political effects, a couple things I'd like to emphasize. One, we are an extremely global company. We are able to get someone a property in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. And if somebody decides that they don't want to visit one place for whatever reason it is, we are fortunate that we have properties where hopefully they will want to go and they'll be able to use us for that. So that's the first point. The second point is we have heard a lot of rhetoric about this, so we look at our data. And we have not seen a material impact from political events in the U.S. that we can tease out and say, that's a cause of something happening. It's – we just don't see it there in a material way. Other people may be seeing different things, but we can't comment on theirs. We're just looking at our data. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And, Perry, we feel like the broader macro trends are positive, particularly in the travel market. We see occupancy rates are strong, ADRs are up, the reported results of other players in the space I think we're very strong. So it feels to us like the macro is healthy. As far as it relates to the trend thus far in the quarter, it's a little bit clouded by the shift in Easter. So when there's a holiday like that where people are traveling, what we'll typically see is an uptick in cancellations going into the holiday for people whose plans have changed, and then while people are traveling, they're not making bookings, and so that impacts our gross bookings growth. So I'd say the broad macro is positive. It's a little bit difficult to read because of the impact of the shift in timing for Easter into Q2. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Great. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks. Wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the seasonality of the kind of noncore hotel accommodation business versus the core hotel. Do you see kind of more alternative accommodations have a longer booking window that's concentrated in the beginning of the year such that that faster growth kind of influences growth rates in 1Q structurally relative to the rest of the year while it's growing faster? Is there any color you can give that help us understand that seasonality? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Lloyd, we're not seeing any significant impact on the booking window from the growth in vacation rentals on our site. And maybe that's based upon the way we're presenting them, very integrated into our search results, and so people are still searching the way they would search. Maybe there are some on-the-margin people that are coming in specifically looking for vacation rentals and they're booking a little bit earlier. But we think that the expansion in the booking window is more driven by growth in repeat users and direct traffic than the addition of vacation rental properties. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. And I guess as a follow-up, it sounds like most of the users coming in and booking alternative accommodations are probably coming in on similar marketing channels and similar search terms. But is there any difference in terms of like where you're finding people who end up booking nontraditional or the kind of marketing ROIs associated with those folks, or those channels? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. We're using the same channels to find people that end up booking vacation rentals. It opens up the panoply of keywords that we can advertise on by having these different types of properties. But the channels are the same. And we have said from time to time in the past that the vacation rental ADRs, take rates and ROIs are fairly similar. I mean, we don't run a separate AdWords campaign just for the vacation rentals. They're part of our broader campaigns and so we look at it in total. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good afternoon. This is Rob on the call for Peter. Another question on vacation rentals around instant bookability. Looking at your competitors today, properties that are online bookable with a 24-hour confirmation outnumber instantly bookable properties there maybe by five to one or more, depending on the market. Just wondering how important changing that owner or manager behavior will be for your supply growth into the future and what you think might change that behavior over time. Also just wondering, it's been a while since you gave us a sense of the relative scale of VR room nights. I think the last time was way back in mid-2015. I'm wondering if you might be willing to give us an update there. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. So, we're not disclosing the room night data. So, we'll not be passing that over. But in regards to growing the supplier base, 51% supplier base growth in that category is a very rapid growth. So, I don't think we're up to the stage where you have to be concerned about changing property manager behavior right now. If and when that happens, we'll deal with it at that point. But right now just by this most recent data that we've disclosed, over 50% growth rate says that we've got a lot of properties out there to put on with the thing – the way they're willing to do it right now and not have to convince anybody of anything. We just need to get them signed up and put on the servers. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. You may begin. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Thanks. And thank you, Dan, and congratulations also. Maybe a quick question on TripAdvisor, have you seen any impact to your performance there since Expedia has been added there? And then any – I think you said it's too small really to move too many needles, but any impact to the business from your Instant Book leads on TripAdvisor? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Hi, Brian. No, what we said was when we got added to Instant Book, there was a lot of questions back then what was the impact. And because of the relative size of TripAdvisor to our business, it wasn't a significant impact to our growth or our advertising efficiency. And so the same is true now as Expedia got added. It hasn't significantly impacted our growth trend for ADRs with TripAdvisor. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Got it. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yeah. Thank you very much. Can you elaborate a bit on the impact of the strong euro on the U.S. inbound and outbound and how meaningful is that as a part of the overall business? And then just on the expense line item, I look at G&A kind of jumped a bit sequentially as well as year-on-year. Anything to call out there? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, strong euro. Times have changed when – now the $1.09/€1 is a strong euro. We're used to the good old days of $1.30. So I see nothing to call out there, Naved. It's been relatively stable for the last year or so. It's kind of been in that like $1.05 to $1.10 range. So nothing that I would call out regarding change in travel behavior from the euro. And I'm sorry, what was your second question? Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Just the G&A expense that kind of jumped sequentially, also year-on-year. So anything to call out, anything one-time there? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Sequential G&A, I mean, the key drivers in there would be office-related expenses, so rent and related occupancy expenses and personnel related expenses, travel, and so forth. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yeah. It's just that it's probably the first time in maybe over a year or so that the line items sort of deleveraged, was the showing leverage. That's why just the reason for the question. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. It would just be investments that we're making in those areas as we're adding head count and being ready for growth in the future. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And I would expect that that would be an area in particular, Naved, where we would have leverage for the most part going forward. So for whatever reason, if it's in Q1, it could surely just be from the Easter shift. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Hi. Thanks and congrats, Dan, on the retirement and on a great tenure. You talked about seasonality in bookings this year with Q2 slower than usual. Can you also comment on the seasonality of profit? Do you anticipate that the typical weighting of profit toward third quarter high season will be increasing this year versus last year? And if so why? Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, we don't have a Q3 forecast for you, Kevin. So, I won't say whether the weighting will increase, because that could give you a read on the bottom line. But it will continue to be by far our biggest profitability quarter of the year given just the normal seasonality of the business with the great preponderance of travel happening in Q3 for high-season summer travel. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Thanks. And then just on the competitive landscape, last year, key competitor was having some issues during this time of year. Are you seeing any change as they've been more ramped up this year? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. A couple things about the way we look at the landscape. One is we try and concentrate mostly on what can we do better, and we don't – we're not as concerned about what our competitors are doing. That's been a part of a culture at The Priceline Group for a very, very long time. So that being said, we're not naive. We do recognize that there is substantial competition out there, and people would like to try and take away some of our business and not let us go as fast as we have been going. I haven't seen any major changes in the last quarter that would indicate any major changes in the competitive landscape. And I'll let Dan, if Dan has any thoughts. Am I missing anything? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. I'll just add from last year, we couldn't notice anything discernible in our results when they were talking about issues with their website, so... Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Yeah. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Yeah. Nothing that we could detect. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question is Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. You may begin. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Can you assess or expound on any changes you are seeing over the past year with the comfort level that traditional vacation-rental property managers that were typically operating through an inquiry-to-book model are now having with the instantly online-bookable model? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You know what? I haven't spoken to enough property managers to be able to answer that accurately or not. I think, we have to just look at the data, and the data is that we have lots of property managers who are willing to put their properties on our system. And as you can see from some of our competitors and what they have said, you can see that's happening in their businesses too. So from that data, I would make the assumption that people are becoming comfortable, or are comfortable, or always were comfortable if there was a system to do it easily. That's the best I think I can answer on that. And I just would reiterate that we are pleased with the growth of our supply in that area, and it is something that we are very focused on. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey. Good afternoon. And, Dan, congrats on a great run. I just have one question for you guys. There's been some chatter that the hotel groups are looking at finding new ways to gain back more direct-booking share, potentially through some I guess alternative methods like more lobbying or legislative or other means. I'd just be curious if you have any thoughts on whether or not this is a risk for Priceline and perhaps generally just how you feel about where your current relationships are with your hotel partners. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Sure. Couple things, and I'll start with saying we have good relationships with our hotel suppliers. And if we didn't have good relationships, we wouldn't be able to grow as fast as we have been growing or have achieved the success that we have been able to achieve. And we do that by providing to our hotel partners some great services, helping them in areas that they can't do. We bring them customers, millions of customers. We put a platform out that enables them to see people from around the world and be able to try and get that customer to come into their hotel. And I read in the news some things that you're referring to, and I'd just make couple of points. One, as I think we have talked about before and you can do by just doing some math on the numbers that we've revealed, we have a mid-single-digit percentage market share in this business. There are a couple implications to that. One is we got a lot of landscape in front of us. There's a lot of room for us going forward. Second thing I'd say is in that news item, I heard them use the word like monopoly, and I just point out that I have never heard the word monopoly used in the same sentence about somebody who has a mid-single-digit share. We've done a very good job with our partners since I've come here 17 years ago. And we will I believe continue to do so going forward. Every company wants to try and have customers come to them direct and lower the marketing distribution cost as much as possible. We get that. Well, we'd like to do so ourselves. Believe me, I'd love for our customers to just call us and not have to pay any marketing at all to get them to come. But that's not the way the committed world works, and you have to pay to get people to come and notice you and pay for them to come continuously and come back. That's the way it works. I don't fault anybody for wanting to try and bring people to their business directly. I do fault anybody who makes misstatements or allegations that aren't true. Enough said. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you Operator Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, I just want to thank everybody for listening to us, and thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Our first question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may begin. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hi. This is Dae Lee in for Doug Anmuth. Thank you for taking the question. First question on gaining share in the U.S. How much of that do you think is taking share from competitors versus adding new properties like vacation rentals? And my second question on share buyback, could you please update us on how you're strategically thinking about buybacks and what could cause that to change? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Thank you, David for Doug, I believe. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC Dae Lee in for Doug. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Let me take – I'm going to take the second one about the share buyback question, and I'll let Dan talk about the first one. We believe we'll be consistent going forward the same way we have been in the past regarding share buyback. We are opportunistic. We recognize shareholders want us to use our cash effectively, efficiently, and appropriately. So as opportunities are there, we will be buying share back, but we do it in a measured way. I think the best way to look forward is to see how we've done over the last few years and consider that as guidance for going forward. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And as far as share in the U.S., Dae Lee, we look at the market – we attempt to size the market based upon the properties that we have on our extranet. So there's over 1.2 million properties on Booking.com today. We know the number of rooms that are in those properties, and so we look at that as a proxy for the market. That includes vacation rentals. So in our room nights booked also include vacation rentals. So we see them as basically interchangeable with hotels and other types of properties as places where people want to stay when they travel and we want to give them the maximum number of choices. So looking at it that way, we can see our growth in total, we still have a relatively low share of the worldwide market single digits. And we can also see our growth for the U.S. market relative to the market's growth and relative to what other players have reported, including our biggest other online travel competitor. And we feel that we're gaining share based upon those metrics. Dae K. Lee - JPMorgan Securities LLC Okay. Thank you very much. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. You may begin. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Thanks for taking my questions. I have a two-part single question. It's under the U.S. Booking.com on the vacation rentals, you have had really good progress there the last year or so, arguably even more than that. I guess I'd be curious if you could just talk about kind of the one or two areas you really look to improve in the U.S. Booking.com and vacation rentals to kind of further drive growth. What would those one or two areas be? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, Brian, as I think the way you asked that question, vacation rentals, I'm going to talk about that in general and not narrow it to any specific geography. We believe it is a very important growth area for us. We've been involved with it for some time. We continue to grow it as I mentioned about 41% increase in the instantly bookable vacation rental properties. We are very pleased with the way we do the business, and that is we don't charge those travelers fees. And as I said, these are all instantly bookable. We think that's an advantage. One of the things we need to continue to do is get even more properties. When you look at some of our competitors they have more properties, and breadth is an important thing to make sure that we have the availability, the right properties at the right price for our customers. So we're going to continue to do that. We also need to make sure that all people are aware that this is a great product. I think that it's not unknown that we do not have the same awareness. There's not the same awareness of our vacation rental property, particularly in the U.S., as some other competitors have. So we need to make sure that everyone knows that we've got a great product there too. And your other question was? Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC It's on the U.S. Booking.com. Kind of just – same kind of question where you've done really well. But if you can kind of point to one or two areas where you say here is some low hanging fruit we could still improve. What would those be? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, I think that we continue to do the same formula that we have done throughout the history of our company and it has helped us get to the level of success that we are. It's not one or two. There is make sure we have breadth of property, make sure we have best price, make sure we have the way a customer goes through our path is the easiest best way for somebody to do it. Be sure that we are offering them in the way they want it. If they want to reserve a property and not have to pay until they show up at the property, we offer that. If they want to pay up-front, we need to be able to offer that. And we have different brands that offer different ways to do it. In fact, most of them offer both ways, though not for all properties. I think in the end, it's just continuing to crank out the same formula we've had in the past, maintain good relationships with the suppliers to make sure we're offering them a great relationship, and we will continue to grow as we have grown in the past. Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Great. Thanks. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may begin. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great. Thank you. Sorry to see you leaving, Dan. I hope it's – I hope you stay for a while. A few questions on guidance. I guess first of all, just help us put the 8% earnings growth in context. It seems like a pretty healthy macro, and an easier comp. And then I think on the prepared remarks you said expect some ROI pressure. I believe on the last call, you indicated that kind of ROI pressure was lessening. Has there been a real change there that's going on? And then maybe did you put your usual amount of conservatism in 2Q guidance given the late – how it's back-end loaded? Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Justin. Well, first of all, for the guidance. No change in approach. Same approach that we've used every quarter. It's a little bit different, in that there's volatility in the early part of the quarter here because of the shift of Easter, and so that makes things a little bit more difficult. I'd say that the market remains healthy. We see occupancy in ADRs are strong. The seasonal impact has certainly negatively impacted growth for Q2. We think the booking window expansion that we have been talking about for a couple of years now is probably all else being equal moving some bookings that would have been made in the past in Q2 into Q1, and even into Q4 as people are booking early. If you look at the midpoint of our room-night guide for Q2 together with our actual results for Q1, it would imply a 23% growth rate, which would compare – it takes the seasonality out of it, with the shift of the hotel or booking window, a shift of Easter timing or booking window. So that 23% growth would compare to a 27% growth for the first half of last year, which we're comfortable with that. We think that's very solid performance. We expect the business to decelerate structurally given the size of it and the long-term trends that we have seen over many years. The growth may decelerate more in certain quarters. We have accelerated in certain quarters. But overall, for the long-term, our growth has been very resilient. It's been a pleasant surprise. The growth drivers that drive – have driven our growth in the past are still there, so the secular shift from offline to online continues. We still have a single-digit share of a very big market, so there's a lot of opportunity to continue to add properties and to continue to penetrate the properties we have more deeply. Our teams are adding properties at a very healthy rate, as Glenn talked about, and we're working every day to continuously improve conversion on our websites. And then we have maintained a very consistent approach to advertising: no change in our approach, no change in competitive position that we can detect. So we continue to invest in reasonable ROIs to drive a healthy mix of top line growth and profitability. The 8% growth in guidance for EBITDA is a function of that top line growth that we talked about and then just the margin pressure that we're guiding to in the quarter, which is less than what we've seen over many of the last quarters where we've guided, and the drivers are pretty much every line item. So we are assuming that there will be more ROI pressure in Q2, but what I said last quarter, that overall we think for the first half of this year the margin pressure from performance marketing will be less than what we experienced in the back half of last year, I stay with that statement. I still feel comfortable with that. And then we're also investing in brand advertising as we're in peak booking season getting ready for peak travel season, and we're investing in OpEx for our brands, customer service people, property people to continue to sign new properties and continue our growth in the future. And then IT people that are working on innovative projects and just keeping up with the growth in the business. Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. You may begin. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. First, congratulations, Dan. That's a phenomenal 33-quarter stretch both fundamentally and obviously in terms of the stock. So congratulations on that. Two questions, please. First, you talked about an expanding bookings window. Is that – as you mix-shift more and more away from hotels to non-hotels and vacation rentals, alternative accommodations, is that just a natural outflow of that that will bring you expanded bookings? And then I think you may have just covered this a little bit in Justin's question, but I'll try it again. The advertising efficiency that exceeded your forecast in the March quarter, was there something – anything new to particular to call out there? Anything that suggests that you'll sustainably improve advertising efficiencies? Or do you think that there was kind of one-time-ish kind of items? Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Okay. Thanks, Mark. Regarding the expanding booking window, I would attribute that more to people continuing to repeat with our business, becoming familiar with the model, with strong occupancy rates and rising ADRs, looking to book farther in advance and feeling comfortable doing that because they know we have a very flexible model and if their plans change later they're able to change their booking. So I think that's the more fundamental driver there. That I would expect to continue. If there were some significant change in macro or maybe people felt less comfortable about whether or not they were going to travel economically or the ADRs were dropping, maybe they would change their behavior. But it would still be a free option to make a booking and then if prices drop you can change your booking later. So I think that's what's driving that. And then ad efficiency was pretty solid in Q1. It's a mix of what's going on at all of our brands. So we have some brands like KAYAK and agoda leaning a little bit more heavily into brand advertising or discounting to drive demand to their websites. There's still underlying ROI pressure, in general, and it's the trend we've seen for many years now. I would expect to see that going forward too, Mark, until we don't see it for an extended period of time. I would just build that into the forecast. It's what we have built into our forecast for Q2. And so that's what's built in there. I wouldn't – there's nothing that I have seen that would lead me to believe that there's a sustainable ability for ROIs to improve year-over-year. Mark Mahaney - RBC Capital Markets LLC Okay. Thank you, Dan. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. You may begin. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks, Dan. You actually kind of touched on this a little bit in response to Mark's question but just kind of curious how we should be thinking about the tradeoff between growth and margins going forward. I understand that the performance advertising line is going to be the biggest variable there, but you guys are clearly outgrowing the industry but we also have seen about 300 basis points of compression so far this year. And it seems to be about that implied in your Q2 guidance. Is that the right kind of run rate in terms of what's necessary to grow bookings and revenues or gross profit at this level given where the macro environment is? Or is there a better way to think of that? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. I see a little less margin pressure than what you're talking about for Q2, Heath, unless you're adjusting for Easter timing. But then there would be less pressure in Q1. So, yeah, I'm seeing more like 150 bps for GAAP operating margins. It's always a balance between top line growth and bottom line growth. We try to strike a balance. From time to time, we see opportunities to invest in brand advertising. We think that's a good thing to do for our business for the long-term. There are OpEx investments that we've come across in the past, things like investing in mobile which have been critical to the success of the business. If you go back to 2012, we were a business that was generating room night reservations of 200 million and over the last 12 months we're more like 600 million room nights. So I think those investments have paid off and we're going to try to make start investments for the future. We're always looking to manage those expenses as closely as we can and with a fast-growing business we generally expect that we can make the investments that we need to make and not have pressure on margins from non-ad OpEx. But from time to time where we see the opportunity, we won't let short-term margin objectives do something that might be detrimental to the long-term growth of the business. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then I guess just on the alternative accommodations business. How much of an advantage, at least when it comes to gaining share and traction in that space, do you feel like your fee-free model for consumers is for you relative to most of the other competitors in this space who are charging consumer-facing fees at this point? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. It's Glenn speaking. Well, that's a difficult question to answer in terms of how we're doing versus the competitors given some are private and don't reveal how fast they're growing. I can only attest to our growth rate. And while we don't give out specific different types of growth rates for our different types of properties, I'm comfortable saying that, in the area you're talking about, that is growing faster than the overall average for the entire company. So we are pleased with that stronger growth rate in that area. We believe and our DNA is experiment and test. If we thought another way was better, we would do it that way. We are pleased with the way we're doing it. And we think in the long run this will be the winner. And one piece of evidence that I point to is I notice some of our competitors who have been shifting to our method of instantly bookable and talking about how fast they're going to be able to get those to be instantly bookable. So I think that would kind of indicate that other people believe that this is the better route. Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs & Co. Great. Thanks, Glenn. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS. You may begin. Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC Thanks for taking the question and congrats, Dan, on the decision. Maybe focusing back on driving engagement with your return customers, I want to understand a little bit about where you're allocating capital either in remarketing to bookers or maybe even the Genius program and how you're thinking about the returns that driving second and third direct traffic back to the site might change some of the marketing efficiency long-term? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Hi. So we don't disclose repeat rates, nor do we disclose how much money we're devoting to remarketing. So a lot of the data you would like to hear, unfortunately I can't share that with you. I can share with you, though, how important we believe repeat business is. And the way you get repeat business isn't just marketing type stuff. What you have to do is provide a great booking experience for the customer. That's something that we think we have done no matter which way they're doing it, whether they're doing it online, or mobile. We believe that we provide a great service to our customers and that's why they come back. A couple other reasons. One that I think is so important is customer service. We spend a lot of money on customer service, and right now in this quarter we're hiring customer service people to be prepared for that very, very important third quarter high season. We have to do that right and we need the people to do that. We need to train them now so they will perform well in that high-season period. Because good customer service is where you get loyalty. It doesn't have to be anything that's screwed up in the booking of it. If the customer has a problem, we want to be able to help them out, no matter what the situation is. That's how we build loyalty, and I think that's one of the reasons for our strong growth. And I can give lots of anecdotes, but I won't. But I know we've reached out and we've helped our customers a great deal and I think that's one of the great reasons that we're being successful. Operator Thank you. Our next question... Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Does that help? Operator Comes from Mark May with Citi. You may begin. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. I know that vacation rentals have been a meaningful contributor to room-night growth recently, but I think you recently stated that you're not only in the early process of adding inventory there, but that you haven't maybe promoted it as much as you would like to your users. And just a question is what are your plans for enhancing the promotion of this offering to your users? And then secondly, another question in terms of the advertising, performance advertising leverage. Is there anything that you're seeing, either in the market externally or things that you're doing internally driven, where you actually think that you could actually see some leverage in ad spend in the near to medium term. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. So I'll take the first one, and Dan will take the second one. I agree with that statement that not as many people know about our great product as I would like, because I'd like everybody to know about it. Now, in terms of your question about how we're going to make more people be aware of our vacation-rental business, we are acting, we are working on it, and we are coming up with plans. But I think the last thing I want to do is reveal what our plans are to our competitors and how we're going to make more people aware that we do have this great product. So I'm going to have to pass on actually giving away the plans on how we're going to make people aware of our product. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And then performance advertising leverage, Mark, it's all the factors you mentioned. So it's what's happening with external players, what we're doing internally, again trying to strike a balance between top line growth and bottom line growth. So we're pushing into channels where we think we can do that efficiently. There's also the manner in which the auction is run by the advertiser, and we're balancing all of those to try and strike a good balance. What I answered earlier to somebody else's question, I wouldn't forecast that there's going to be leverage in performance marketing. I would have to see that for a number of quarters and have some reason to expect it to continue before I would build that into a forecast. While we have had quarters here and there where the leverage story on performance marketing has been better, in general now for many years, all the way back to 2012, it's been a source of margin pressure. And I've seen it as a source of margin pressure in other players in our space too. In fact, to a greater degree on their margins than what we've experienced with ours. So I feel comfortable that we are continuing to expand our lead in a very competitive marketplace, and performance marketing has been the most important tool that we have used to try and drive traffic to our website over our history and build our brands. We're improving our capabilities with brand advertising, and we look to deploy money there too where we think we can get a reasonable return. Even if it's over a longer period of time because there's typically a lag there between when you spend and then the benefit that you get by having more brand awareness and having people potentially come to you directly, which would improve the performance advertising metrics. And maybe even just cause them to search for our brand or a higher propensity to click on our brand when they search in other paid channels. So I think there's opportunities for us from time to time to invest a little bit more heavily in brand advertising and that would help, but I wouldn't forecast performance advertising leverage until we see that happening. Mark A. May - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Bieber with Credit Suisse. You may begin. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations, Dan. I was hoping you can provide some color on the puts and takes that drove the lower year-over-year agency take rates. I think some of that is from the Easter shift, but hoping that you can elaborate. And then the second question is I was hoping that you'd provide color on why meta-search is becoming so strategically important across the industry? Is it because of Trivago's growth? Is it because of the breakdown of rate parity? Or are there some other reasons for just the strategic importance of meta-search? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Why don't I take that second one first, and Dan can take the first one. So meta is important. We have KAYAK. We're pleased with their performance. And there are others, like you mentioned Trivago. But I'd caution you when I say how important it is, I'm not sure it's a qualitative term, not a quantitative term. I'd like to point out that our overall business through meta is still a relatively small amount. So I wouldn't overemphasize it. It's important but I wouldn't overemphasize it. Why is it growing? Why do people like to use it? I could give some potential reasons of people enjoy to be able to see multiple price properties there with different prices so they can see is this the best price or not. And then they can go off to a place like Booking.com or Priceline or agoda and do the actual booking. But the why side of the point to us is making sure that we're there. We try and run our business so we are aware of where the customer wants to be. And customers who want to use meta, we have a great product there for them. And that's how we do it. It's us not trying to tell the customer you should use this; it's us making sure we have the best product service available for that customer who wants to use it. And I think that's the best way to look at it. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And, Paul, your assumption was correct on the agency take rate. So you're looking at agency gross profit divided by agency gross bookings. That's down because of the Easter shift. The fundamental take rates are very, very stable. Paul Bieber - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC Okay. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays. You may begin. Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats, Dan. I just had two questions. One was a follow-up on the earlier question about repeat users. So have some of those efforts that Glenn mentioned to drive repeats, are those metrics actually improving? Or do you guys kind of view this as a space where the potential around repeat, given the low frequency of purchases, just may not be there? Or is there a penetration rate that you think the industry needs to be at where, you know, repeat – organic repeat can be a source of leverage at some point down the road? And then the second question is, any color on Facebook's new retargeting product for travel? I know you guys have been testing it. How has that been going? Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. It's Glenn speaking. So going back on that repeat. I think, you know, the way we answered it pretty much answered as much as we can say. Although I will add that we are very pleased with our repeat rate. And I'm not going to give out a repeat number, but I'd caution everybody in trying to think they know what it is. So I just want to caution you on that. The second thing which I didn't mention about repeat, which I think is an important factor, is providing that great service and having them come back is something that not only helps us with that person, but there's that ability for people to be talking about what a good service it is. So you get another benefit in that word-of-mouth type advertising that's also very helpful and very powerful. So we agree repeat is very important. We work to make sure we give a good service. We want them to have that good service, and then there's an echo effect on it going forward. In regards to Facebook, we have mentioned earlier several times that we are working with Facebook, trying to improve the way to get more business out of Facebook. We have people who are dedicated to working with Facebook to create this because we pointed out we would like to spend a lot more money with Facebook. But as Dan has pointed out and we've talked about a lot in the past, we try to be very disciplined about our marketing expense and we want to get the appropriate ROI. So we need to come up with tools and ways to get and products – ways that Facebook will give us a good return on our spend. When that happens, we are ready, willing, able to spend a lot of money with them to find another way to get customers. Is that helpful? Ross Sandler - Barclays Capital, Inc. Super helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Perry Gold with MoffettNathanson. You may begin. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Thanks so much for taking the question and congratulations, Dan. Two please if I may. Can you provide any color in terms of any potential impact you saw to inbound travel to the U.S. as a result of the current administration's rhetoric and attempted travel bans? And could you also provide any color on broader macro or regional trends you have seen through the first five weeks or so of 2Q? Any notable changes to call out? Thanks so much. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. I'll just take the first part, and Dan can talk about the second part. Regarding political effects, a couple things I'd like to emphasize. One, we are an extremely global company. We are able to get someone a property in more than 200 countries and territories around the world. And if somebody decides that they don't want to visit one place for whatever reason it is, we are fortunate that we have properties where hopefully they will want to go and they'll be able to use us for that. So that's the first point. The second point is we have heard a lot of rhetoric about this, so we look at our data. And we have not seen a material impact from political events in the U.S. that we can tease out and say, that's a cause of something happening. It's – we just don't see it there in a material way. Other people may be seeing different things, but we can't comment on theirs. We're just looking at our data. Dan? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And, Perry, we feel like the broader macro trends are positive, particularly in the travel market. We see occupancy rates are strong, ADRs are up, the reported results of other players in the space I think we're very strong. So it feels to us like the macro is healthy. As far as it relates to the trend thus far in the quarter, it's a little bit clouded by the shift in Easter. So when there's a holiday like that where people are traveling, what we'll typically see is an uptick in cancellations going into the holiday for people whose plans have changed, and then while people are traveling, they're not making bookings, and so that impacts our gross bookings growth. So I'd say the broad macro is positive. It's a little bit difficult to read because of the impact of the shift in timing for Easter into Q2. Perry Gold - MoffettNathanson LLC Great. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. You may begin. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Thanks. Wondering if you can just talk a little bit about the seasonality of the kind of noncore hotel accommodation business versus the core hotel. Do you see kind of more alternative accommodations have a longer booking window that's concentrated in the beginning of the year such that that faster growth kind of influences growth rates in 1Q structurally relative to the rest of the year while it's growing faster? Is there any color you can give that help us understand that seasonality? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Lloyd, we're not seeing any significant impact on the booking window from the growth in vacation rentals on our site. And maybe that's based upon the way we're presenting them, very integrated into our search results, and so people are still searching the way they would search. Maybe there are some on-the-margin people that are coming in specifically looking for vacation rentals and they're booking a little bit earlier. But we think that the expansion in the booking window is more driven by growth in repeat users and direct traffic than the addition of vacation rental properties. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. And I guess as a follow-up, it sounds like most of the users coming in and booking alternative accommodations are probably coming in on similar marketing channels and similar search terms. But is there any difference in terms of like where you're finding people who end up booking nontraditional or the kind of marketing ROIs associated with those folks, or those channels? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. We're using the same channels to find people that end up booking vacation rentals. It opens up the panoply of keywords that we can advertise on by having these different types of properties. But the channels are the same. And we have said from time to time in the past that the vacation rental ADRs, take rates and ROIs are fairly similar. I mean, we don't run a separate AdWords campaign just for the vacation rentals. They're part of our broader campaigns and so we look at it in total. Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Okay. Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo. You may begin. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Good afternoon. This is Rob on the call for Peter. Another question on vacation rentals around instant bookability. Looking at your competitors today, properties that are online bookable with a 24-hour confirmation outnumber instantly bookable properties there maybe by five to one or more, depending on the market. Just wondering how important changing that owner or manager behavior will be for your supply growth into the future and what you think might change that behavior over time. Also just wondering, it's been a while since you gave us a sense of the relative scale of VR room nights. I think the last time was way back in mid-2015. I'm wondering if you might be willing to give us an update there. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. So, we're not disclosing the room night data. So, we'll not be passing that over. But in regards to growing the supplier base, 51% supplier base growth in that category is a very rapid growth. So, I don't think we're up to the stage where you have to be concerned about changing property manager behavior right now. If and when that happens, we'll deal with it at that point. But right now just by this most recent data that we've disclosed, over 50% growth rate says that we've got a lot of properties out there to put on with the thing – the way they're willing to do it right now and not have to convince anybody of anything. We just need to get them signed up and put on the servers. Robert James Coolbrith - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Okay. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. You may begin. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Thanks. And thank you, Dan, and congratulations also. Maybe a quick question on TripAdvisor, have you seen any impact to your performance there since Expedia has been added there? And then any – I think you said it's too small really to move too many needles, but any impact to the business from your Instant Book leads on TripAdvisor? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Hi, Brian. No, what we said was when we got added to Instant Book, there was a lot of questions back then what was the impact. And because of the relative size of TripAdvisor to our business, it wasn't a significant impact to our growth or our advertising efficiency. And so the same is true now as Expedia got added. It hasn't significantly impacted our growth trend for ADRs with TripAdvisor. Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC Got it. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. You may begin. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yeah. Thank you very much. Can you elaborate a bit on the impact of the strong euro on the U.S. inbound and outbound and how meaningful is that as a part of the overall business? And then just on the expense line item, I look at G&A kind of jumped a bit sequentially as well as year-on-year. Anything to call out there? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, strong euro. Times have changed when – now the $1.09/€1 is a strong euro. We're used to the good old days of $1.30. So I see nothing to call out there, Naved. It's been relatively stable for the last year or so. It's kind of been in that like $1.05 to $1.10 range. So nothing that I would call out regarding change in travel behavior from the euro. And I'm sorry, what was your second question? Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Just the G&A expense that kind of jumped sequentially, also year-on-year. So anything to call out, anything one-time there? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Sequential G&A, I mean, the key drivers in there would be office-related expenses, so rent and related occupancy expenses and personnel related expenses, travel, and so forth. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Yeah. It's just that it's probably the first time in maybe over a year or so that the line items sort of deleveraged, was the showing leverage. That's why just the reason for the question. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. It would just be investments that we're making in those areas as we're adding head count and being ready for growth in the future. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. And I would expect that that would be an area in particular, Naved, where we would have leverage for the most part going forward. So for whatever reason, if it's in Q1, it could surely just be from the Easter shift. Naved Khan - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen and Company. You may begin. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Hi. Thanks and congrats, Dan, on the retirement and on a great tenure. You talked about seasonality in bookings this year with Q2 slower than usual. Can you also comment on the seasonality of profit? Do you anticipate that the typical weighting of profit toward third quarter high season will be increasing this year versus last year? And if so why? Thanks a lot. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, we don't have a Q3 forecast for you, Kevin. So, I won't say whether the weighting will increase, because that could give you a read on the bottom line. But it will continue to be by far our biggest profitability quarter of the year given just the normal seasonality of the business with the great preponderance of travel happening in Q3 for high-season summer travel. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Okay. Thanks. And then just on the competitive landscape, last year, key competitor was having some issues during this time of year. Are you seeing any change as they've been more ramped up this year? Thanks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. A couple things about the way we look at the landscape. One is we try and concentrate mostly on what can we do better, and we don't – we're not as concerned about what our competitors are doing. That's been a part of a culture at The Priceline Group for a very, very long time. So that being said, we're not naive. We do recognize that there is substantial competition out there, and people would like to try and take away some of our business and not let us go as fast as we have been going. I haven't seen any major changes in the last quarter that would indicate any major changes in the competitive landscape. And I'll let Dan, if Dan has any thoughts. Am I missing anything? Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. I'll just add from last year, we couldn't notice anything discernible in our results when they were talking about issues with their website, so... Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Yeah. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. Yeah. Nothing that we could detect. Kevin Kopelman - Cowen and Company, LLC Got it. Thank you. Daniel J. Finnegan - The Priceline Group, Inc. You're welcome. Operator Thank you. Our next question is Jed Kelly with Oppenheimer. You may begin. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Great. Can you assess or expound on any changes you are seeing over the past year with the comfort level that traditional vacation-rental property managers that were typically operating through an inquiry-to-book model are now having with the instantly online-bookable model? Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. You know what? I haven't spoken to enough property managers to be able to answer that accurately or not. I think, we have to just look at the data, and the data is that we have lots of property managers who are willing to put their properties on our system. And as you can see from some of our competitors and what they have said, you can see that's happening in their businesses too. So from that data, I would make the assumption that people are becoming comfortable, or are comfortable, or always were comfortable if there was a system to do it easily. That's the best I think I can answer on that. And I just would reiterate that we are pleased with the growth of our supply in that area, and it is something that we are very focused on. Jed Kelly - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Thank you. Operator Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. You may begin. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Hey. Good afternoon. And, Dan, congrats on a great run. I just have one question for you guys. There's been some chatter that the hotel groups are looking at finding new ways to gain back more direct-booking share, potentially through some I guess alternative methods like more lobbying or legislative or other means. I'd just be curious if you have any thoughts on whether or not this is a risk for Priceline and perhaps generally just how you feel about where your current relationships are with your hotel partners. Thank you. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Sure. Couple things, and I'll start with saying we have good relationships with our hotel suppliers. And if we didn't have good relationships, we wouldn't be able to grow as fast as we have been growing or have achieved the success that we have been able to achieve. And we do that by providing to our hotel partners some great services, helping them in areas that they can't do. We bring them customers, millions of customers. We put a platform out that enables them to see people from around the world and be able to try and get that customer to come into their hotel. And I read in the news some things that you're referring to, and I'd just make couple of points. One, as I think we have talked about before and you can do by just doing some math on the numbers that we've revealed, we have a mid-single-digit percentage market share in this business. There are a couple implications to that. One is we got a lot of landscape in front of us. There's a lot of room for us going forward. Second thing I'd say is in that news item, I heard them use the word like monopoly, and I just point out that I have never heard the word monopoly used in the same sentence about somebody who has a mid-single-digit share. We've done a very good job with our partners since I've come here 17 years ago. And we will I believe continue to do so going forward. Every company wants to try and have customers come to them direct and lower the marketing distribution cost as much as possible. We get that. Well, we'd like to do so ourselves. Believe me, I'd love for our customers to just call us and not have to pay any marketing at all to get them to come. But that's not the way the committed world works, and you have to pay to get people to come and notice you and pay for them to come continuously and come back. That's the way it works. I don't fault anybody for wanting to try and bring people to their business directly. I do fault anybody who makes misstatements or allegations that aren't true. Enough said. Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. Thank you Operator Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Glenn D. Fogel - The Priceline Group, Inc. Well, I just want to thank everybody for listening to us, and thank you very much. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Scott Anderson Thank you, John, and welcome, everyone, to today’s conference call. Patterson Companies is moving through a period of systemic change in both of its businesses. For several quarters, we have outlined the steps we are taking to position Patterson for the future, a future where Patterson is in the right combination of end markets; is the partner of choice with the right sales, service, support and product offerings; and has the right technology infrastructure to anticipate and adapt to market change. Fiscal 2017 represented a period of intensified change, driven by significant strategic decisions and the fortitude to whether the near-term ramifications of these decisions to arrive at a new place for our company, our customers and our shareholders. There are two major dimensions to the change currently underway. The first is external or a market-driven dimension. We continually listen to our customers, anticipating the future needs of our end markets and making swifter decisions to adapt. This drove some very important decisions making – made in fiscal 2017, especially in our Dental segment. The second dimension is internal. I can’t overemphasize the importance of the changes being driven by the implementation of our enterprise resource planning initiative. We are deep into the general rollout of this multiyear effort and expect this new system to boost our agility, allow us to more quickly adapt our business models and response to market opportunities and to serve customers at a higher level. It will also give us the additional ability to leverage both data and insights to provide further benefit to our customers, and we are not waiting until it’s complete to do that. Finally and importantly, it will give us a best-in-class technology infrastructure of the same caliber as our market-leading sales, technical support and customer service capabilities. I firmly believe we have the best people in the market, and this new ERP system will multiply that advantage by enhancing our effectiveness with our customers. And as Ann will explain a bit later, we are hitting our stride with this initiative. We have been on our current strategic path since 2015. And in roughly two years, we have accomplished several of the marquee elements of the transformation we are pursuing. It’s important to begin our discussion today here because the current complexion of our business reflects the near-term impacts on the strategic decision-making. In our Dental segment, we are engineering both for changing customer demands and for a broader range of clinical environments. At the center of these efforts is a fundamental rethinking of how tomorrow’s customers will define the concept of value and their partner. We believe that concept is evolving. It will play to our strengths, and we believe our capabilities will be even more relevant. Earlier in fiscal 2017, we started to refocus and refine our sales force. We are fully committed to our sales force model and firmly believe that a high-value consultative sales approach that addresses the full range of customer needs will be more important as clinical environments become more technologically-dependent. And our sales force will continue to be a key competitive differentiator. This trend will only intensify, and the goal of our sales force optimization efforts was to bring more opportunity to the professionals who are better capable of serving our customers in this way. We also refocused our approach to our technology portfolio in Dental, electing not to extend our exclusive distribution rights for Sirona’s CEREC technology. This decision will open up our distribution platform to a wider range of offerings. Like our sales force changes, this too is a customer-driven move. We need the flexibility to deliver the right kind of digital solution to any clinical environment. There is a large percentage of the market that has yet to adopt digital chairside technologies, and we anticipate substantial growth in this area over the next three years to five years. Patterson has been selling and supporting dental technology investments for over 20 years. We excel at building and refining a superior service and support capability. Naturally, this has been essential to the growth of the technologies like CEREC. But other technology manufacturers recognize this as well and are eager to take advantage of our powerful support backbone. At The International Dental Show in Cologne, Germany in March, we began to see a significant proliferation of digital impression in CAD/CAM products. We believe we now have a unique opportunity to lead the expansion and industry penetration of these offerings. While it takes time and effort to transition to a broader technology portfolio, the momentum at IDS helped affirm for us that we made the right decision at the right time. In our Animal Health segment, we committed to broadening our approach to this market and creating a larger platform for growth, and we did this through our expansion into the Production Animal market two years ago. Today, this business segment is exposed to two markets with well-accepted strong long-term growth catalysts, persistently improving Companion Animal trends and global market for animal protein, which is tied to major demographic shifts. We have been methodical in our integration efforts, focusing on blending our operational functions and supporting sales execution. We believe we successfully navigated most of the major integration hurdles and milestones. Across both businesses, we believe we are making the right decisions that will create a strong foundation for growth. However, we want to be perfectly clear, our current financial performance is not yet reflecting the strength of our new model. We have always prepared – been prepared to disrupt ourselves and make the adjustments necessary to position for greater opportunity, and we acknowledge that our business strategies are creating headwinds across our business. But we also understand the expectations to perform, and we’re taking additional measures to improve that performance. For the next several minutes, I’ll outline several supplemental initiatives starting in our Dental segment. Our sales force optimization initiatives have clearly created near-term disruption. We have better data and nearly a year’s worth of insights since we undertook this initiative. We believe refining our sales force to better align with the needs of customers was the right strategic thing to do, but it has compressed our ability to serve certain portions of the market. This was reflected in our fourth quarter sales performance, most notably in sales of consumables. Therefore, we intend to make targeted supplemental investments in our sales force, adding the right people in the right place where we have identified clear gaps and market opportunity. In addition to these direct investments in our sales force, we also intent to support sales execution through enhanced marketing support. Furthermore, we will be using insights from our new ERP system to assist in this effort. Our ERP system implementation is now reaching a level of maturity where we are gaining access to better data that allows us to more accurately segment our customers and better target their needs. So as we incrementally reinforce our sales capabilities, we will bring them to market from a stronger data-driven perspective. The other key area of focus in Dental will be accelerating the expansion of our technology product portfolio. We have a lot of confidence in this move. Our customers’ definition of digital dentistry is changing and expanding, and we need to change along with it. Dentsply Sirona remains an invaluable partner, and we are delighted to move forward with them under the terms of our new distribution agreement. However, our decision in November not to review our exclusive distribution contract for the CEREC CAD/CAM technology, an exclusive selling arrangement we had maintained for approximately 20 years, is another factor that is creating near-term disruption and headwinds. This impact of this was clear in our technology sales during the fourth quarter. Over the next several months, we will be working diligently to bring additional product lines on to our platform. We expect to announce new manufacturing relationships in the coming months, and we’ll be training our sales force on these lines to bring them to our customers later in fiscal 2018. Naturally, this transition to a broader product platform will take time. But we have made transitions like this before, notably in core equipment where we broadened beyond our longtime ADEC relationships. This move allowed us to serve a wider range of customers with more product options. It has led to an improved growth profile in this category, and that is reflected in our fourth quarter results and strong full fiscal year sales growth in traditional equipment. On to Patterson Animal Health and our supplemental initiatives in this segment. Thus far, the integration of our Companion Animal and Production Animal business has been successful, but we have learned much in the process and recognized that we have more to do. We have been focused on sales execution, which is critical when merging two sales organizations. Sales in our fiscal fourth quarter was solid, and we are pleased with the revenue gains, not only in Companion Animal, but also Production Animal, where we saw additional recovery and solid performance across all categories of species. But as we noted in prior quarters, the profit contribution from this segment has additional room for improvement. We began efforts to improve the margin profile of this segment early in fiscal 2017. Our initial efforts have focused on adjusting and aligning our marketing approaches and better managing our marketing mix. I am pleased to say that we have made progress, but we can and will do more. Just as importantly, our integration process continues to garner our targeted synergies. Today, we have strength in our underlying markets in this segment. The long-term growth catalysts are well supported, and we remain fundamentally important – we remained a fundamentally important part of the supply chain. Across Patterson, we also intend to drive discipline horizontally across the enterprise. We are instituting several measures designed to improve efficiency across functions. These include more disciplined spending, marketing and working capital management. I am confident that this heightened enterprise-wide sensitivity to performance and costs, in combination with the core strategies that we continue to pursue, will restore our ability to drive sales in dental, enhance profitability and animal health and improve the overall net margin profile of Patterson Companies. With that, I’ll ask Ann to review the financials. Ann Gugino Thank you, Scott, and thank you all for joining us today. My comments will primarily focus on an overview of the fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full year results; our progress on the enterprise resource planning initiative or ERP; and our fiscal 2018 outlook. As I’ve done in the past, I will discuss sales and adjusted results for continuing operations. As Scott mentioned, Patterson is in the midst of positioning our business for the future through a series of major initiatives. The initiatives impacting our business in fiscal 2017 included; our decision to move away from exclusivity and expand the dental sales channel to include exciting new digital technologies beyond CEREC, our ongoing integration in Animal Health, and our ERP implementation. We have undertaken these major customer-centric initiatives to improve Patterson’s long-term performance, recognizing the short-term disruption these choices may cause. I will say more about our initiatives as I go through our results. Now looking at our top line performance, we had a challenging 2017 fourth quarter for many of the reasons I just stated. Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter were essentially flat at $1.4 billion on a reported basis. When adjusting for currency translations, sales improved about 1%. Turning to margins. Our fourth quarter consolidated operating margin was 7.4%, a 90 basis points decline versus the prior year quarter. Consolidated operating margin in the quarter primarily reflects margin compression in our Animal Health segment and the planned incremental costs from our ERP implementation. Operating margins in our Dental segment were up 70 basis points year-over-year as our disciplined approach to cost reduction partially offset lower Dental sales in the quarter. As Scott indicated, we are committed to improving the net margin profile of our business through a variety of initiatives, including better sales execution and product mix management and intensified costs containment. This is an enterprise-wide focus of Patterson. On the bottom line, GAAP net income from continuing operations was $61.4 million or $0.65 per diluted share compared to $65.6 million or $0.68 per diluted share a year ago. Adjusted net income from continuing operations, which excludes certain non-recurring and deal amortization costs, totaled $65.6 million in the quarter, down 11.4% from $74.1 million in the same quarter last year. It is important to point out that on a pre-tax basis the step-up from ERP expenses represents approximately $10 million of the decrease in adjusted net income for the quarter, as anticipated. Adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations declined 10.4% to $0.69 in the fourth quarter. Now let’s turn to our segments. In Dental, current quarter sales reflected the impact of our strategic initiatives. While we anticipated some level of sales interruption related to these initiatives, sales were lower than anticipated in both dental consumables and technology equipment. On a GAAP basis, Dental sales were down 8.3%, essentially the same in constant currency versus the prior year quarter. Patterson sales of consumable dental supplies decreased 4.3% in the fourth quarter. Moving on to dental equipment sales, equipment sales declined 17% in the fourth quarter, primarily due to lower sales of Sirona products and a tough comparison to last year’s fourth quarter. The challenged performance in Sirona-related products was partially offset by solid growth in our core equipment, which was up mid-single digits in the quarter. As Scott mentioned, our previous decision to broaden our core equipment portfolio illustrates the direction we are taking with our technology portfolio. We believe we are beginning to see the benefits of that decision in the core equipment category. We anticipate that the headwinds in our technology equipment business will persist through 2018 as we transition through our new go-to-market strategy. To address the challenges that we encountered in the Dental segment, we are in the process of supplementing and enhancing our go-to-market strategy through a combination of better customer segmentation, strengthened marketing support and additional sales coverage. We also plan to invest in the first half of fiscal 2018 in training our sales force on the new technology products we will add to our portfolio. We believe that these actions will begin benefiting Dental sales in the second half of fiscal 2018. We are committed to regaining our growth and margin profile in the Dental segment. Now turning to our Animal Health business. We are encouraged by our sales performance with increased sales and share gains across our Animal Health business in the 2017 fourth quarter. On a reported basis, consolidated Animal Health sales grew 6% year-over-year. After adjusting for the impact of currency, Animal Health segment sales rose 8.6%. Looking at our companion animal business. Our fourth quarter total reported companion animal sales rose 3.5%. Adjusting for currency, total companion animal sales increased 8.3% over the prior year quarter. Looking at our U.S. companion animal sales, reported growth was up 10.6%, 6.3% when adjusted for agency buy sell. Production animal sales in the fourth quarter grew 8.9% in constant currency versus the year-ago period. Our overall performance in the production animal segment reflects stronger sales across all species. We achieved particularly strong market share gains in swine and solid results in beef and dairy. While we don’t believe we are yet see a fundamental change in the growth profile of production animal end markets, we are pleased with our sales penetration and share gains in the quarter. We are not however, satisfied with the profit contribution from our Animal Health segment. We saw good execution on synergy capture and cost control. However, these savings were not enough to offset continued pressure on gross margins, resulting in a 70 basis point decrease in operating margin for Animal Health. We are working to improve Animal Health operating margins in three primary ways: first, through better marketing and focus on product sales mix; second, by more effectively partnering with our vendors; and lastly, we are focused on continuing strong cost control and further capturing renaming integration synergies. As part of our Animal Health integration, we remain committed to more effectively leveraging supply chain logistics across both businesses and further consolidating our back-office functions. And we are on track to deliver a three-year synergy total in our stated range of $20 million to $30 million. Regarding the ERP system rollout, we are hitting several positive milestones of this initiative. The system will ultimately help drive new efficiencies across our enterprise and provide the foundation for more ambitious and effective e-commerce platform. The implementation of our ERP system rollout continued to progress in the fourth quarter. As we have moved through the piloting and rollout phases of this initiative, we’ve gone to great lengths to ensure that our learning at every step have been quickly leveraged and rolled forward in the subsequent stages. In the current quarter, we brought additional locations on to the new platform. We now have broad implementation of the system, with more than 50% of our U.S. dental and companion animal business live and operating on the new system. It is impressive to see how this ERP system is already starting to transform our business and providing us with actionable data that we didn’t have before, some of which we will put to immediate use in our Dental segment initiative. As previously disclosed, we had a $25 million pretax step-up in expense for the fiscal year associated with the ERP system. We expect ERP expenses to continue into fiscal 2018 at an annual level of approximately $30 million. Please note this includes the previous mentioned $25 million, plus an incremental $5 million as we to further scale up deployment and annualized depreciation expense. It’s important to point out that we expect this step-up to occur in the first half of fiscal 2018, with a proportionate step down in these costs during the second half of fiscal 2018 as we complete system training. Now a look at a few balance sheet and cash flow items. During the quarter, we more effectively managed working capital and generated solid cash flow. Working capital levels came down by $92.4 million in the fourth quarter. While working capital levels generally increased in our first quarter, we anticipate that much of this improvement is a permanent reduction in annual working capital. Moving on to Patterson’s full year fiscal 2017 results. Reported net sales for fiscal 2017 increased 3.8% to $5.6 billion. Full year adjusted sales grew approximately 2.9%, excluding the effect of currency translation, the extra week in the prior fiscal year period and the additional six weeks impact of Animal Health International. Fiscal 2017 EPS came in at the high end of our revised guidance range. Reported earnings totaled $1.82 per diluted share compared to a $1.90 last year. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $2.34 compared to $2.47 per diluted share last year. On a full year basis, our bottom line benefited from a decrease in our adjusted effective tax rate, adding $0.03 to $0.04 of adjusted EPS. For 2017 the balance sheet was relatively static. Inventories were down slightly by about $10 million. We made significant progress in lowering Dental inventory, which was nearly offset by an increase in Animal Health inventory. I will remind you that we are maintaining higher inventories in our Animal Health business due to ongoing integration efforts. We expect these levels to come down a year from now. For the year, we generated cash flow from operations of $166 million, down from $195 million in the prior year. Our full year cash flow met our targeted goal to convert between 85% to 100% of net income into free cash flow. Over the next five years, we continue to expect to generate more than $1.3 billion of free cash flow. For the next – CapEx for the fiscal year totaled $47 million and included investments in our corporate-wide information technology initiatives. Turning to our capital allocation strategy. We continued to execute on that strategy by returning cash to our shareholders. We returned approximately $63 million to our shareholders in dividends and share repurchases during the fourth quarter and about $220 million for the year. We remain fully committed to our dividend, and we have increased it every year since it was instituted. We have approximately 13.6 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization. In terms of capital expenditures, we expect fiscal 2018 CapEx in the same general range as fiscal 2017 at approximately $50 million. Our strong balance sheet along with our newly expanded debt capacity gives us the flexibility to repurchase shares opportunistically. Now I will review our fiscal 2018 outlook and guidance. In fiscal 2018, as Scott said, we will continue to move through a period of intense execution on a range of initiatives that we believe are critical for longer-term costs and bottom line expansion. This drives several assumptions that are important to understanding our guidance range. We are putting in place supplemental initiatives that give us several mechanisms to help manage our performance as we transition through fiscal 2018 to stronger growth. This is all about managing the controllable aspects of our business. Some of these initiatives are focused purely on efficiency and cost containment such as, improving efficiencies as we implement our ERP system, focusing on procurement savings, continuing to improved working capital, particularly around inventory and receivables; and increasing our breadth of cost control discipline. Other actions are focused directly on driving sales execution and revenue expansion, such as our go-to-market initiative in Dental. With this combination of initiatives, we expect consolidated operating margin in fiscal 2018 similar to fiscal 2017. Given the near-term complexity of the business, we believe that it’s prudent to widen our EPS range. On a GAAP basis, we expect fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $1.90 to $2.05 per diluted share. On an adjusted basis, we expect fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations in the range of $2.25 to $2.40 per diluted share. We anticipate an adjusted tax rate next year around 35%. In terms of market conditions, our fiscal 2018 guidance assumes North American and international market conditions similar to those experienced in fiscal 2017. It also assumes the same combination of headwinds that we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2017 as we transitioned through a period of significant strategic execution. These headwinds include the continued rollout of our ERP implementation, the transition to the exploration of our exclusivity with Sirona toward a broader product portfolio, and margin challenges in our Animal Health segment. In addition, we anticipate diluted average shares outstanding in the range of 92 million to 94 million shares. With that, I’ll turn it back to Scott for further comments. Scott Anderson Thanks, Ann. I’ll wrap up with just a few additional comments. Patterson Companies has a 140-year history of looking forward and pursuing change, and we have always adapted to get to a new position of strength. I believe we are on just such a path. As Ann indicated, part of what makes this period of change different, and I would argue exciting, is the complement of several systemic changes that we believe will lead Patterson Companies, our customers and shareholders to new levels of value. We expect that our core strategies as well as the additional measures we are undertaking will lead to lasting positive impacts. I want to acknowledge and thank those who are directly affected by helping us navigate through this change. To our customers, the course we are on is in many ways a direct response to your feedback on the kind of partner we need to be to help you compete and grow. We thank you for your patience and we believe that the results of these changes will be worth it and lead to an improved experience with Patterson Companies. And to our employees, we thank you for our diligence and enthusiasm to help guide Patterson through this important time. Now with that, we’d like to take any questions, and I’ll turn the call back over to Shayla. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Nathan Rich Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Thanks for the question. Scott, maybe just to start just on the sales force optimization, can you talk about what’s played out differently than you expected when you made these changes last year, that has led to the decision to make now these supplemental investments in the sales team? And how quickly can you make those investments? And when should we expect to see consumables start to pick up again? Scott Anderson Yes, Nathan. When I talked about – I’ll talk a little about the consumables in general, and then give some specifics on the sales force. So, as you look at the quarter, I think this is important – the consumable performance obviously was mixed. But it was a combination of areas of strength, offset by pockets of underperformance and largely driven by those multiple change initiatives we talked about. As Ann pointed out and I did in my script, we do have a number of initiatives underway to not only strengthen areas where we’re not performing and over-performing, but also addressing those pockets of underperformance. So I’d say one of the things that the sales force realignment that we realized here in the back half of the year was there is geographic opportunity for expansion in addition in some areas. We also feel it’s a great opportunity in terms of where we sit today, particularly with the maturity of our ERP rollout and the broadening of our product portfolio, that we really have an attractive opportunity to be very strategic about where we’re going to add salespeople. So those programs are currently underway. And as you look at how this will play out over the year, we would expect to see that pay-off probably in the back half of the year. Nathan Rich Okay, and then just as a follow-up on guidance. Given the supplier transition that you’ll have on the equipment side going on in the middle of the fiscal year, is there any guidance you can give us on how we should think about equipment growth in the first half relative to the back half? And specifically, have you seen any I guess lack of urgency from the sales force around selling high-tech equipment, just in anticipation of you guys bringing on those new brands later in the year? Ann Gugino Maybe I’ll start and then I’ll pass it over to Scott. So he can really talk more about the sales force reaction. But just as you think about the transition, we can’t give you the direct impact on the expansion of the strategy. It’s a tough question because we don’t really want to speak for the competition, and we don’t really want to start providing guidance on discrete product lines. Here’s what I would say, we definitely factored the transition into the guidance, but there are a lot of variables that play here. And at this time, we’re in the process of finalizing new partnerships. Obviously there will be different price points on the new products, and then there are some start-up costs in terms of the training. So I think that speaks directly to the wider range that we provided for fiscal 2018. We want to allow for some additional variability, given the number of moving pieces around the transition. And then I think more broadly when you think about quarterly guidance, certainly in the first half, we’re going to have tougher challenges than in the back half in terms of growth. So in the first half as you know, we have the transition away from exclusivity with Sirona, which will negatively impact the year. But we will plan to mitigate some of that in the back half as we start to ramp on selling other digital products. But in addition to that in the first half, we have the unfavorable ERP expense comparison, which then turns favorable in the second half. So to give you just some flavor by quarter, we’ll be down to prior year low double digits in the first quarter. We think we can get to flat to up slightly in Q2. And then it’s really back to low single-digit growth in the back half of the year. That’s I guess how I would guide you. Scott Anderson Yes, Nathan. When you look at – back on the last year in this totality of equipment, it is I think one of the really great stories of the year was how strong our core equipment growth was, it grew in a high single digits for the full year. Our fourth quarter was the largest volume fourth quarter we’ve had in eight years. And the effectiveness of our sales force I think really shine through in that really critical category, which is roughly half of our total equipment spend. But when you look at sort of the current market conditions around the technology side, I think it’s important to frame up that first of all, a year ago was the introduction of the new Zirconia workflow from Sirona. And that new product introduction garnered considerable attention and interest. And just from a volume perspective, last Q4 was our biggest CEREC quarter in history from a volume perspective. So we were up against a tough comp, but there absolutely is some disruption out there. And I would sort of categorize it on a couple fronts, both from the new distribution landscape and also depending new product launches in North America. I think we’re working through a transition time in the market, but we feel this transition will create a great environment to accelerate sales. And from a customer perspective, and I think this is important where everyone should take the long view, over 80% of dentists do not own a digital scanning or CAD/CAM solution. So while we do have some short-term market confusion, we know this will settle down. And then all will concentrate on helping the dentists integrate these great technologies into their practices. So bottom line, some purchasing behavior has been stalled for a number of reasons, but we’ll get through this. And what excites me is there is a real buzz about the future of visitable dentistry. And in the end, that is good for Patterson, and it’s going to be good for others as well. Nathan Rich Thanks, I appreciate the details. Scott Anderson Thanks, Nathan. Operator Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is open. John Kreger Hi, thanks very much. Maybe just a follow-up on the dental equipment topic. Scott, can you just, if you can, dissect that 17% decline a little bit? What do you think the markets doing now maybe versus the disruption around the Dentsply Sirona relationship and sales force realignment? And maybe another way to ask that would be when you look out a year or two through these disruptive things happening, where would you like to see your dental equipment growth when things settle out? Scott Anderson Yes, it’s a great question, John. And I think one of the key points and I think it’s very important is to look at how dentists are investing in sort of their core assets, the dental chair, the dental units, the cabinetry that reinvestment in the core functions. And that has been an area that has been challenged really since 2009, 2010 recession. So I am very encouraged by dentist reinvestment in their practices and our ability with our broadened portfolio to really grow that business, as I said, in the high single digits and have such a strong volume fourth quarter. So to me, that’s one piece of the puzzle, but I think we all know the exciting piece of the puzzle going forward is going to be this transformation from analog to digital and something that we’ve built in infrastructure in terms of sales, service support and training around for 20 years. So it is a bit of a transition period as new partners begin to align themselves and broader access to products becomes known. When you look at just the greenfield opportunity for digital scanning and CAD/CAM, as I said, 80% of the customers do not have those products, but at some point will. I would say as we’ve talked about before the intraoral digital imaging, of which we were the real leader with our relationship with Schick, most of that space has been penetrated. So it’s more a replacement market, but I still see a nice story for many years to come on the 3D cone beam, and then how all these products integrate together. So if you – we’re at the IDS meeting in March, I think one of the great themes is sort of the digital workflow and something that we’ve been seeing for about a decade. But now you have multiple players that can deliver great products. You’ve got Dentsply Sirona, who’s our great partner, as an innovator that I think will continue to innovate and be a leader. So I can’t peg a specific growth rate, but I can tell you the next decade is going to be very exciting for dentistry. John Kreger Okay, thanks. And a quick follow-up. I think one of the bigger market changes that you guys are alluding to is this idea of DSOs and larger groups forming. Can you give us an update on how that segmentation strategy is going at this point? Scott Anderson Yes. Obviously, it’s a market as all markets are evolving and difficult customer segments are forming. And we’ve really been working hard on this for some time. And part of our investments in what we’re doing with the company is to really build out a platform of capabilities to serve all customers, to help independents thrive and grow their practices and integrate technology, to help sort of these midsize middle market groups grow as they become more sophisticated and then also have the capabilities as a company to be the supply chain partner for the larger DSO. So to me, it’s an exciting time at Patterson because we have the ability to sit down at the table with all of those customer segments and really drive value across the board to all of them. And we’ve been building and investing to have those capabilities to do that. John Kreger Great. Thank you. Scott Anderson Thanks, John. Operator Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum. Kevin Ellich Hey Scott, hey Ann. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott, just wanted to go back to the Animal Health business. Growth was really strong, especially in production animal, which is kind of counterintuitive to what we heard from some of the other animal health companies this quarter. I guess what’s really driving the production animal growth? I think it was around 9%. And you said, a lot I guess, growth across all species. How much of the growth actually came from price versus volume? And what other trends you could talk about? Scott Anderson Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Looking at the production business, we had a very strong quarter, sales up nearly 9%, and as I said, reflecting nice share gains across all species. But also want to temper that and caution a little bit and there could be some timing factor from Q3 to Q4. In Q3, we grew roughly about 1.5%, but then came in with a really strong fourth quarter. We’re encouraged because we are seeing improvements in the end markets. The beef market is slowly improving as the producer profitability continues to pick up. But we also have executed really well in the field and picked up new customers. Swine market is very strong. Exports are up nicely. And once again, we’ve also gained some market share with our differentiated logistical solutions as well as benefiting from some of our key customers expanding. And I think one of the really good notes here is really the strengthening of the dairy market, which is seen not only a small uptick in milk prices but U.S. state – USDA reported that there’s an increase in the number of dairy cows and then the input costs have fallen. And obviously, one of the key markets for dairy is California and with the breaking of the drought that has benefited our dairy customers out in California, which we hope it will be a net tailwind as we move into the next year. And then just touching on companion fundamentals and companion remains solid and we do expect consistent market growth for years to come and as well in the companion, we feel like once again, we gained share. So to me it was pretty consistent across the board in terms of no great call out between volume and mix in any of the two businesses. Kevin Ellich Got you. And then one quick follow-up for Ann. So looking at the balance sheet and cash flow statement, it looks like DSO ticked up I think six days year-over-year I guess. Where do think that will normalize, and how long will it take to get there? And then your free cash flow conversion, you’re still targeting 85% to 100% of net income, is that correct? And I guess, when I look at it, it doesn’t look like you guys hit that in 2017. Am I looking at it correctly? Ann Gugino So a couple of things, then I’ll come back to the free cash flow conversion. But I think your first question was on the receivables and the days sales outstanding and seeing that pickup. And that really relates to an increase in accounts receivable that was driven by a large – largely by timing of sales. Because our sales were heavily concentrated in April, particularly in the production animal business, we don’t have – aging looks really good. So I would expect that to flip pretty quickly. So I don’t anticipate that to be a long-range challenge. With that said, if you look at our working capital levels in total, while they came down nicely in the fourth quarter, we’re still up year-over-year by about $50 million. And I think we still have additional opportunity to improve our working capital levels over the next year. While we made some good improvement that I think is permanent in the fourth quarter, in dental inventories, I think we have more opportunity in inventories in general across the network as well as accounts receivables as we continue to stabilize our SAP implementation. So that’s how I would kind of characterize working capital. If you look at the free cash flow conversion, I do believe we are looking at it as a percent of net income. So if my math as I’m looking at the cash flow from operations at $166 million and I’m dividing it by net income of $174 million and I’m getting the 95%, I’m wondering if what you’re thinking is we have been targeting about $200 million to $250 million of free cash flow. And we are a bit short of that this year, which is really due to the underlying softness in the performance of the business together with some of these higher working capital investments that we’ve just talked about. Kevin Ellich Okay, so that’s actually net operating cash as a percent of net income, not – we look at free cash flow as operating cash flow less CapEx. We can talk later. That’s fine. Ann Gugino Yes. I didn’t take – I have not point the CapEx out. It’s net income – it’s cash flow from operations divided by net income is how I calculated it. But yes, I think where you would pull the CapEx out. Kevin Ellich Great. Thank you. Operator We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson Thank you, good morning, guys. Scott, I wanted to ask you, I think you guys have done a good job of talking about some of the tradition on the equipment side. I’m still trying to understand what really has changed on the dental consumable side, since you made some of the sales force changes back almost exactly a year ago or I guess 11 months ago now. I know putting more ERP expenses in, CRM tools in the hands, I would think that should be additive. But just really trying to understand over the last six months or so, we’ve seen kind of a little bit of sequential softening in that consumables number, even since those cuts went in place. So what’s changed over those six or nine months since those cuts went into effective? Can you talk maybe about the stability of your customer base, stability of your sales force post those cuts? I think that would be helpful. Scott Anderson Yes, Jeff, great question. And I think the way we look at it is obviously with everything we’ve talked about, there is a disruption in the business. And as I’ve talked about, we have really identified where the underperformance is and are attacking that. I think two things that are very encouraging. One is the customer experience is going to continue to improve with the stabilization of ERP. And when you look at getting on the back half of the first six months of our fiscal year where we will predominantly have North America rolled out, we feel that’s going to be a real addition. And then the other piece of it, too is we just have identified that while we gave a lot of opportunity to our reps in terms of added capacity, we also know that there is parts of the market that we just don’t have strong enough coverage. And we’re going to go back and incrementally strategically add sales reps in those areas. So we feel like we’ve got a strong handle on it and are looking to drive the business. As I go back and sort of also talk about the strength in core equipment, when you look at how many customers we’re accessing in core equipment and customers that were doing business with us previously, we know we’re gaining share in many areas, but we have to shore up those pockets where we’ve had underperformance. Ann Gugino And Jeff, I might just chime in because we talked a lot about access to additional data with SAP and customer segmentation that you kind of asked about the customer base. We are doing very well and continue to do very well with that 80% or 20% of our customer base that makes up 80% of our sales volume. So that core base continues to be very loyal despite while SAP is going well. It’s not without its challenges. So you’ve got kind of some disruption there, so again, very solid with the core base where we seem to have some erosion is more with that casual customer. So there is a fair amount of customers that split their business between more than one supplier. And so it’s really strengthening our marketing efforts with that casual base of customer, whether that’s through adding a sales rep or whether that’s through telesales or strengthened marketing efforts. So I would just add that fine point on there. Jeff Johnson All right. That’s helpful. And then, I guess, my only other question is really on stock comp. When I look at the cash flow statement anyway, it looks like stock comp, on a year-over-year basis was down pretty meaningfully. Is there any fundamental change and kind of how you’re thinking about compensation for your senior executives, for the rest of the employee base? Just wondering why stock comp was down, at least by the cash flow statement, down pretty meaningfully in the quarter year-over-year? Thanks. Scott Anderson Yes, Jeff. I would say that we have a tradition of pay following performance. And this was a challenging year. And we adjust compensation to adjust the performance. Jeff Johnson Understood. Thank you. Operator We will take our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a few more details on the OpEx improvement we saw in the quarter. And then, how you think that improvement may flow in through the – for fiscal 2018? Thanks. Ann Gugino Thanks, Elizabeth. So certainly our current quarter expense leverage reflected good progress on cost structure improvements. It was down about 90 basis points versus prior year. This clearly helped mitigate the softer underlying performance of the business in the fourth quarter. As you can imagine, any time when you’re not performing at the level that you would expect for yourself and you hold yourself accountable to delivering, you’re going to get after managing the expenses. And this effort really began when we lowered guidance about six months ago. So you’re really starting to see some of that work manifest itself in the current quarter results. So as we look to 2018, our guidance definitely assumes that we continue to execute on these aggressive and disciplined approaches to managing costs. We’ve got a number of initiatives going on from leveraging our scale to reduce indirect spend, we’ve got procurement-related initiatives and then, of course, just overall lean cost containment programs. So when I look at FY2018 and some of the headwinds that we’re facing, it’s really going to come down to tight focus, prioritization on costs and then, of course, managing through the additional business complexity the two businesses are facing here. Elizabeth Anderson Got it. And then, in terms of – a follow-up question on the new dental hires that you’re making. Can you talk about the typical ramp-up of a new dental salesperson hire and sort of how that will impacts going forward? Scott Anderson Yes. And I have personal experience with someone who manage multiple sales operations during my career at Patterson. It generally is a 90 to 120 day ramp-up, but I would say we think it’s really unique right now because we know we’ve already identified really target-rich sales territories and environments. So we would look to accelerate that ramp-up. Elizabeth Anderson Okay, Perfect. Thanks so much. Scott Anderson Thanks Elizabeth. Operator We will take our next question from Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is open. Allen Lutz This is Allen Lutz in for Mike. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about the dental tools performance in the quarter, does that include a full contribution from your recent DSO win? And is there any way to quantify that? Ann Gugino It does include the Heartland win, but I’m not going to separately pull out and quantify Heartland for a couple of reasons. One, I wouldn’t want to start talking specifically about the size of any one particular customer. And then, two, it’s all part of our business and it really is the result of all the work that the team has been doing to reposition the business. And so, to me, it’s more as a result of all the work we’ve done and sort of pulling out really doesn’t make sense. Now clearly, the consumable business is down further without the Heartland piece in it. Allen Lutz Got it. And then, on the inventory dip, you guys talked about the focus on technology equipment, but is there any way to categorize exactly how long it would take to fully replenish that inventory? Ann Gugino So we’re trying to permanently reduce the inventory. So I’m a little confused by the question of replenish the inventory. Allen Lutz Got it – no, that would be – that’s helpful. Thank you. Ann Gugino Okay. Operator We will take our next question from Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block Great. Thanks guys, good morning. And maybe I’ll just play cleanup on a couple of questions or issues. The first is on the ERP expense. And I thought the peak was supposed to be fiscal 2017, but I think you said fiscal 2017 was about $25 million and that’s supposed to go to $30 million with the depreciation kicking in, in fiscal 2018. So can you talk about, I guess, one, is that correct? And then, as we look forward and it’s fully implemented, how do we think about the costs stepping down now in fiscal 2019 and beyond? And then, I’ve got a follow-up. Thanks. Ann Gugino Sure. So you’re right. So we incurred $25 million of step-up in expense in 2017 and for 2018, we are expecting $5 million more. So it’s a total of $30 million, but it’s all concentrated in the first half of the year. So the incremental expense of $5 million really hits in the first six months. And it is annualized in that depreciation just as we ramp up on deployment. I think some of the switching there just have to do with you – of how you’re thinking about deployment and how fast or slow you can go, but if I look at the quarterly year-over-year comparison, we’re looking at an increase in expense of between $6 million and $8 million for both the first and second quarter. And then, as we get through implementation and the comps get easier in the back half of the year, we would expect a benefit in the expense rate to prior year of between $3 million and $5 million a quarter. So that’s this year. And what you’re seeing there really is about 25% of that step-up in expense is rollout and implementation costs and so that goes away. And then, really, your question is, how does that look in FY2018 or FY2019? And in FY2019, that’s really when you’re going to start to see the benefits of the new system kick in, in terms of efficiencies plus you’re going to have six more months of that implementation cost that happened this year in the first six months come out. So I’m not really quantifying it – that at this point, but we will have, in addition to lower implementation costs because there won’t be any in FY2019, you’ll start to see lower costs because you’ll shut off the legacy system and you’ll start to harness some of the efficiencies because you’re up and running on one common platform. Jon Block Okay. Very helpful. Got it. And, I guess, it’s what leaves some of the back end with your EPS guidance year-over-year. And then, Scott, maybe just for you. I mean, honestly I was surprised on the consumable number considering Heartland did kick in. I know you’ve got a lot of moving parts. But to an earlier question, can you just be a little bit more specific? On the sales and marketing investment in Dental, is that specific to reps? And if so, is it specific to reps in regions where you may have cut and maybe over cut, if you would? And then, the other question, we’d just be taking a step back and looking at the market. I think last quarter you went down the road a little bit more stable versus strengthening. As we sit here three months later, what’s your current perspective on the overall dental market? Thanks guys. Scott Anderson Yes. Thanks, Jon. So a little more clarity. We’re going to be very selective in terms of – and I would say the other piece of this is we just have richer information starting to flow out of our ERP system that, I think, is going to help us make better strategic investments in terms of hiring. But this is not just a sales rep strategy. This is also an omni-channel, digital, outbound telesales. There are many different ways that we can address the entire market, and that is part of the strategy. I would say to the overall market, I would say the dental market is still very stable. Once again, I will use sort of our strength this year in core equipment, up nearly double-digits, as sort of a bedrock of the stability of the space. And I would say just this disruption period around technology is a very short-term headwind that leads to a lot of opportunity on the back half. So we’ve got our own work to do and we’re diligently doing it. And I think our dental team is very excited to turn around the profile and start growing again. Operator We will take our final question from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard Hey, thanks. Good morning. Scott Anderson Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard Scott, just a conceptual question for you on the ERP three parts. Number one, can you describe how customers will experience a change with the new ERP system? Number two, how will it help you really sell more products and do so more efficiently? And number three, is there any elements of the new system that can help you optimize pricing in a better way? Scott Anderson Yes. Great, Brandon. Let me talk a little bit holistically about ERP and hopefully I’m going to hit all three of those issues and if I don’t, I’ll come back to it. But obviously, this is a big undertaking for the organization. It was one of our key strategies we’ve discussed back over five years really since I moved into the role. I’ve had a lot of business mentors and fellow CEOs that have counseled me that these transformations are not for the faint of heart, but really, and this gets to your question, the power of the business tool upon completion is worth the journey. And it’s worth the journey for customers, employees and, ultimately, the owners of the company. I would say when you look at the customer benefits, one of the things we’re excited about is the ability to tailor the customer experience in a more personalized way. And that looks to things like self-service for the customers, scheduling online, richer data that customers can use to drive their practices, the ability for our sales reps – and our best reps are great business consultants. How do we leverage that data to help our customers? Obviously, with richer data and richer systems, you can make smarter business solutions as well. And I think if you look at the growth story of Patterson over 25 years, really strong leaders in technology and sales execution, but the discipline, that really is going to be important for any company to compete and win in the modern marketplace. It’s how you use the information you have as a company to help your customer and just the richness of the tool we’re going to have on the other end creates that opportunity. And I think you can see the type of talent as well that we brought into the organization in terms of some really high-end marketing talent that come from industries that have experienced these evolutions. One of the things I love about Patterson is we were trailblazers. And I go back to my early days as a sales rep installing electronic ordering systems pre-Internet back in San Francisco. So over 80% of our business today comes to us electronically, but we have an opportunity to take this to a whole other level and that’s why getting the plumbing right, the infrastructure right and making that investment now is so critical. Brandon Couillard That’s helpful. Thank you. Scott Anderson Thanks Brandon. Operator I will now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Anderson for closing remarks. Scott Anderson Thanks, Shayla, and thanks, everyone, for your time this morning. We look forward to updating you to our progress on our next call. Operator That concludes today’s conference.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Nathan Rich Hi. This is Nathan Rich on for Bob this morning. Thanks for the question. Scott, maybe just to start just on the sales force optimization, can you talk about what’s played out differently than you expected when you made these changes last year, that has led to the decision to make now these supplemental investments in the sales team? And how quickly can you make those investments? And when should we expect to see consumables start to pick up again? Scott Anderson Yes, Nathan. When I talked about – I’ll talk a little about the consumables in general, and then give some specifics on the sales force. So, as you look at the quarter, I think this is important – the consumable performance obviously was mixed. But it was a combination of areas of strength, offset by pockets of underperformance and largely driven by those multiple change initiatives we talked about. As Ann pointed out and I did in my script, we do have a number of initiatives underway to not only strengthen areas where we’re not performing and over-performing, but also addressing those pockets of underperformance. So I’d say one of the things that the sales force realignment that we realized here in the back half of the year was there is geographic opportunity for expansion in addition in some areas. We also feel it’s a great opportunity in terms of where we sit today, particularly with the maturity of our ERP rollout and the broadening of our product portfolio, that we really have an attractive opportunity to be very strategic about where we’re going to add salespeople. So those programs are currently underway. And as you look at how this will play out over the year, we would expect to see that pay-off probably in the back half of the year. Nathan Rich Okay, and then just as a follow-up on guidance. Given the supplier transition that you’ll have on the equipment side going on in the middle of the fiscal year, is there any guidance you can give us on how we should think about equipment growth in the first half relative to the back half? And specifically, have you seen any I guess lack of urgency from the sales force around selling high-tech equipment, just in anticipation of you guys bringing on those new brands later in the year? Ann Gugino Maybe I’ll start and then I’ll pass it over to Scott. So he can really talk more about the sales force reaction. But just as you think about the transition, we can’t give you the direct impact on the expansion of the strategy. It’s a tough question because we don’t really want to speak for the competition, and we don’t really want to start providing guidance on discrete product lines. Here’s what I would say, we definitely factored the transition into the guidance, but there are a lot of variables that play here. And at this time, we’re in the process of finalizing new partnerships. Obviously there will be different price points on the new products, and then there are some start-up costs in terms of the training. So I think that speaks directly to the wider range that we provided for fiscal 2018. We want to allow for some additional variability, given the number of moving pieces around the transition. And then I think more broadly when you think about quarterly guidance, certainly in the first half, we’re going to have tougher challenges than in the back half in terms of growth. So in the first half as you know, we have the transition away from exclusivity with Sirona, which will negatively impact the year. But we will plan to mitigate some of that in the back half as we start to ramp on selling other digital products. But in addition to that in the first half, we have the unfavorable ERP expense comparison, which then turns favorable in the second half. So to give you just some flavor by quarter, we’ll be down to prior year low double digits in the first quarter. We think we can get to flat to up slightly in Q2. And then it’s really back to low single-digit growth in the back half of the year. That’s I guess how I would guide you. Scott Anderson Yes, Nathan. When you look at – back on the last year in this totality of equipment, it is I think one of the really great stories of the year was how strong our core equipment growth was, it grew in a high single digits for the full year. Our fourth quarter was the largest volume fourth quarter we’ve had in eight years. And the effectiveness of our sales force I think really shine through in that really critical category, which is roughly half of our total equipment spend. But when you look at sort of the current market conditions around the technology side, I think it’s important to frame up that first of all, a year ago was the introduction of the new Zirconia workflow from Sirona. And that new product introduction garnered considerable attention and interest. And just from a volume perspective, last Q4 was our biggest CEREC quarter in history from a volume perspective. So we were up against a tough comp, but there absolutely is some disruption out there. And I would sort of categorize it on a couple fronts, both from the new distribution landscape and also depending new product launches in North America. I think we’re working through a transition time in the market, but we feel this transition will create a great environment to accelerate sales. And from a customer perspective, and I think this is important where everyone should take the long view, over 80% of dentists do not own a digital scanning or CAD/CAM solution. So while we do have some short-term market confusion, we know this will settle down. And then all will concentrate on helping the dentists integrate these great technologies into their practices. So bottom line, some purchasing behavior has been stalled for a number of reasons, but we’ll get through this. And what excites me is there is a real buzz about the future of visitable dentistry. And in the end, that is good for Patterson, and it’s going to be good for others as well. Nathan Rich Thanks, I appreciate the details. Scott Anderson Thanks, Nathan. Operator Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is open. John Kreger Hi, thanks very much. Maybe just a follow-up on the dental equipment topic. Scott, can you just, if you can, dissect that 17% decline a little bit? What do you think the markets doing now maybe versus the disruption around the Dentsply Sirona relationship and sales force realignment? And maybe another way to ask that would be when you look out a year or two through these disruptive things happening, where would you like to see your dental equipment growth when things settle out? Scott Anderson Yes, it’s a great question, John. And I think one of the key points and I think it’s very important is to look at how dentists are investing in sort of their core assets, the dental chair, the dental units, the cabinetry that reinvestment in the core functions. And that has been an area that has been challenged really since 2009, 2010 recession. So I am very encouraged by dentist reinvestment in their practices and our ability with our broadened portfolio to really grow that business, as I said, in the high single digits and have such a strong volume fourth quarter. So to me, that’s one piece of the puzzle, but I think we all know the exciting piece of the puzzle going forward is going to be this transformation from analog to digital and something that we’ve built in infrastructure in terms of sales, service support and training around for 20 years. So it is a bit of a transition period as new partners begin to align themselves and broader access to products becomes known. When you look at just the greenfield opportunity for digital scanning and CAD/CAM, as I said, 80% of the customers do not have those products, but at some point will. I would say as we’ve talked about before the intraoral digital imaging, of which we were the real leader with our relationship with Schick, most of that space has been penetrated. So it’s more a replacement market, but I still see a nice story for many years to come on the 3D cone beam, and then how all these products integrate together. So if you – we’re at the IDS meeting in March, I think one of the great themes is sort of the digital workflow and something that we’ve been seeing for about a decade. But now you have multiple players that can deliver great products. You’ve got Dentsply Sirona, who’s our great partner, as an innovator that I think will continue to innovate and be a leader. So I can’t peg a specific growth rate, but I can tell you the next decade is going to be very exciting for dentistry. John Kreger Okay, thanks. And a quick follow-up. I think one of the bigger market changes that you guys are alluding to is this idea of DSOs and larger groups forming. Can you give us an update on how that segmentation strategy is going at this point? Scott Anderson Yes. Obviously, it’s a market as all markets are evolving and difficult customer segments are forming. And we’ve really been working hard on this for some time. And part of our investments in what we’re doing with the company is to really build out a platform of capabilities to serve all customers, to help independents thrive and grow their practices and integrate technology, to help sort of these midsize middle market groups grow as they become more sophisticated and then also have the capabilities as a company to be the supply chain partner for the larger DSO. So to me, it’s an exciting time at Patterson because we have the ability to sit down at the table with all of those customer segments and really drive value across the board to all of them. And we’ve been building and investing to have those capabilities to do that. John Kreger Great. Thank you. Scott Anderson Thanks, John. Operator Our next question comes from Kevin Ellich of Craig-Hallum. Kevin Ellich Hey Scott, hey Ann. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott, just wanted to go back to the Animal Health business. Growth was really strong, especially in production animal, which is kind of counterintuitive to what we heard from some of the other animal health companies this quarter. I guess what’s really driving the production animal growth? I think it was around 9%. And you said, a lot I guess, growth across all species. How much of the growth actually came from price versus volume? And what other trends you could talk about? Scott Anderson Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Looking at the production business, we had a very strong quarter, sales up nearly 9%, and as I said, reflecting nice share gains across all species. But also want to temper that and caution a little bit and there could be some timing factor from Q3 to Q4. In Q3, we grew roughly about 1.5%, but then came in with a really strong fourth quarter. We’re encouraged because we are seeing improvements in the end markets. The beef market is slowly improving as the producer profitability continues to pick up. But we also have executed really well in the field and picked up new customers. Swine market is very strong. Exports are up nicely. And once again, we’ve also gained some market share with our differentiated logistical solutions as well as benefiting from some of our key customers expanding. And I think one of the really good notes here is really the strengthening of the dairy market, which is seen not only a small uptick in milk prices but U.S. state – USDA reported that there’s an increase in the number of dairy cows and then the input costs have fallen. And obviously, one of the key markets for dairy is California and with the breaking of the drought that has benefited our dairy customers out in California, which we hope it will be a net tailwind as we move into the next year. And then just touching on companion fundamentals and companion remains solid and we do expect consistent market growth for years to come and as well in the companion, we feel like once again, we gained share. So to me it was pretty consistent across the board in terms of no great call out between volume and mix in any of the two businesses. Kevin Ellich Got you. And then one quick follow-up for Ann. So looking at the balance sheet and cash flow statement, it looks like DSO ticked up I think six days year-over-year I guess. Where do think that will normalize, and how long will it take to get there? And then your free cash flow conversion, you’re still targeting 85% to 100% of net income, is that correct? And I guess, when I look at it, it doesn’t look like you guys hit that in 2017. Am I looking at it correctly? Ann Gugino So a couple of things, then I’ll come back to the free cash flow conversion. But I think your first question was on the receivables and the days sales outstanding and seeing that pickup. And that really relates to an increase in accounts receivable that was driven by a large – largely by timing of sales. Because our sales were heavily concentrated in April, particularly in the production animal business, we don’t have – aging looks really good. So I would expect that to flip pretty quickly. So I don’t anticipate that to be a long-range challenge. With that said, if you look at our working capital levels in total, while they came down nicely in the fourth quarter, we’re still up year-over-year by about $50 million. And I think we still have additional opportunity to improve our working capital levels over the next year. While we made some good improvement that I think is permanent in the fourth quarter, in dental inventories, I think we have more opportunity in inventories in general across the network as well as accounts receivables as we continue to stabilize our SAP implementation. So that’s how I would kind of characterize working capital. If you look at the free cash flow conversion, I do believe we are looking at it as a percent of net income. So if my math as I’m looking at the cash flow from operations at $166 million and I’m dividing it by net income of $174 million and I’m getting the 95%, I’m wondering if what you’re thinking is we have been targeting about $200 million to $250 million of free cash flow. And we are a bit short of that this year, which is really due to the underlying softness in the performance of the business together with some of these higher working capital investments that we’ve just talked about. Kevin Ellich Okay, so that’s actually net operating cash as a percent of net income, not – we look at free cash flow as operating cash flow less CapEx. We can talk later. That’s fine. Ann Gugino Yes. I didn’t take – I have not point the CapEx out. It’s net income – it’s cash flow from operations divided by net income is how I calculated it. But yes, I think where you would pull the CapEx out. Kevin Ellich Great. Thank you. Operator We will take our next question from Jeff Johnson of Baird. Your line is open. Jeff Johnson Thank you, good morning, guys. Scott, I wanted to ask you, I think you guys have done a good job of talking about some of the tradition on the equipment side. I’m still trying to understand what really has changed on the dental consumable side, since you made some of the sales force changes back almost exactly a year ago or I guess 11 months ago now. I know putting more ERP expenses in, CRM tools in the hands, I would think that should be additive. But just really trying to understand over the last six months or so, we’ve seen kind of a little bit of sequential softening in that consumables number, even since those cuts went in place. So what’s changed over those six or nine months since those cuts went into effective? Can you talk maybe about the stability of your customer base, stability of your sales force post those cuts? I think that would be helpful. Scott Anderson Yes, Jeff, great question. And I think the way we look at it is obviously with everything we’ve talked about, there is a disruption in the business. And as I’ve talked about, we have really identified where the underperformance is and are attacking that. I think two things that are very encouraging. One is the customer experience is going to continue to improve with the stabilization of ERP. And when you look at getting on the back half of the first six months of our fiscal year where we will predominantly have North America rolled out, we feel that’s going to be a real addition. And then the other piece of it, too is we just have identified that while we gave a lot of opportunity to our reps in terms of added capacity, we also know that there is parts of the market that we just don’t have strong enough coverage. And we’re going to go back and incrementally strategically add sales reps in those areas. So we feel like we’ve got a strong handle on it and are looking to drive the business. As I go back and sort of also talk about the strength in core equipment, when you look at how many customers we’re accessing in core equipment and customers that were doing business with us previously, we know we’re gaining share in many areas, but we have to shore up those pockets where we’ve had underperformance. Ann Gugino And Jeff, I might just chime in because we talked a lot about access to additional data with SAP and customer segmentation that you kind of asked about the customer base. We are doing very well and continue to do very well with that 80% or 20% of our customer base that makes up 80% of our sales volume. So that core base continues to be very loyal despite while SAP is going well. It’s not without its challenges. So you’ve got kind of some disruption there, so again, very solid with the core base where we seem to have some erosion is more with that casual customer. So there is a fair amount of customers that split their business between more than one supplier. And so it’s really strengthening our marketing efforts with that casual base of customer, whether that’s through adding a sales rep or whether that’s through telesales or strengthened marketing efforts. So I would just add that fine point on there. Jeff Johnson All right. That’s helpful. And then, I guess, my only other question is really on stock comp. When I look at the cash flow statement anyway, it looks like stock comp, on a year-over-year basis was down pretty meaningfully. Is there any fundamental change and kind of how you’re thinking about compensation for your senior executives, for the rest of the employee base? Just wondering why stock comp was down, at least by the cash flow statement, down pretty meaningfully in the quarter year-over-year? Thanks. Scott Anderson Yes, Jeff. I would say that we have a tradition of pay following performance. And this was a challenging year. And we adjust compensation to adjust the performance. Jeff Johnson Understood. Thank you. Operator We will take our next question from Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Elizabeth Anderson Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a few more details on the OpEx improvement we saw in the quarter. And then, how you think that improvement may flow in through the – for fiscal 2018? Thanks. Ann Gugino Thanks, Elizabeth. So certainly our current quarter expense leverage reflected good progress on cost structure improvements. It was down about 90 basis points versus prior year. This clearly helped mitigate the softer underlying performance of the business in the fourth quarter. As you can imagine, any time when you’re not performing at the level that you would expect for yourself and you hold yourself accountable to delivering, you’re going to get after managing the expenses. And this effort really began when we lowered guidance about six months ago. So you’re really starting to see some of that work manifest itself in the current quarter results. So as we look to 2018, our guidance definitely assumes that we continue to execute on these aggressive and disciplined approaches to managing costs. We’ve got a number of initiatives going on from leveraging our scale to reduce indirect spend, we’ve got procurement-related initiatives and then, of course, just overall lean cost containment programs. So when I look at FY2018 and some of the headwinds that we’re facing, it’s really going to come down to tight focus, prioritization on costs and then, of course, managing through the additional business complexity the two businesses are facing here. Elizabeth Anderson Got it. And then, in terms of – a follow-up question on the new dental hires that you’re making. Can you talk about the typical ramp-up of a new dental salesperson hire and sort of how that will impacts going forward? Scott Anderson Yes. And I have personal experience with someone who manage multiple sales operations during my career at Patterson. It generally is a 90 to 120 day ramp-up, but I would say we think it’s really unique right now because we know we’ve already identified really target-rich sales territories and environments. So we would look to accelerate that ramp-up. Elizabeth Anderson Okay, Perfect. Thanks so much. Scott Anderson Thanks Elizabeth. Operator We will take our next question from Michael Cherny of UBS. Your line is open. Allen Lutz This is Allen Lutz in for Mike. Thanks for taking the question. As we think about the dental tools performance in the quarter, does that include a full contribution from your recent DSO win? And is there any way to quantify that? Ann Gugino It does include the Heartland win, but I’m not going to separately pull out and quantify Heartland for a couple of reasons. One, I wouldn’t want to start talking specifically about the size of any one particular customer. And then, two, it’s all part of our business and it really is the result of all the work that the team has been doing to reposition the business. And so, to me, it’s more as a result of all the work we’ve done and sort of pulling out really doesn’t make sense. Now clearly, the consumable business is down further without the Heartland piece in it. Allen Lutz Got it. And then, on the inventory dip, you guys talked about the focus on technology equipment, but is there any way to categorize exactly how long it would take to fully replenish that inventory? Ann Gugino So we’re trying to permanently reduce the inventory. So I’m a little confused by the question of replenish the inventory. Allen Lutz Got it – no, that would be – that’s helpful. Thank you. Ann Gugino Okay. Operator We will take our next question from Jon Block of Stifel. Your line is open. Jon Block Great. Thanks guys, good morning. And maybe I’ll just play cleanup on a couple of questions or issues. The first is on the ERP expense. And I thought the peak was supposed to be fiscal 2017, but I think you said fiscal 2017 was about $25 million and that’s supposed to go to $30 million with the depreciation kicking in, in fiscal 2018. So can you talk about, I guess, one, is that correct? And then, as we look forward and it’s fully implemented, how do we think about the costs stepping down now in fiscal 2019 and beyond? And then, I’ve got a follow-up. Thanks. Ann Gugino Sure. So you’re right. So we incurred $25 million of step-up in expense in 2017 and for 2018, we are expecting $5 million more. So it’s a total of $30 million, but it’s all concentrated in the first half of the year. So the incremental expense of $5 million really hits in the first six months. And it is annualized in that depreciation just as we ramp up on deployment. I think some of the switching there just have to do with you – of how you’re thinking about deployment and how fast or slow you can go, but if I look at the quarterly year-over-year comparison, we’re looking at an increase in expense of between $6 million and $8 million for both the first and second quarter. And then, as we get through implementation and the comps get easier in the back half of the year, we would expect a benefit in the expense rate to prior year of between $3 million and $5 million a quarter. So that’s this year. And what you’re seeing there really is about 25% of that step-up in expense is rollout and implementation costs and so that goes away. And then, really, your question is, how does that look in FY2018 or FY2019? And in FY2019, that’s really when you’re going to start to see the benefits of the new system kick in, in terms of efficiencies plus you’re going to have six more months of that implementation cost that happened this year in the first six months come out. So I’m not really quantifying it – that at this point, but we will have, in addition to lower implementation costs because there won’t be any in FY2019, you’ll start to see lower costs because you’ll shut off the legacy system and you’ll start to harness some of the efficiencies because you’re up and running on one common platform. Jon Block Okay. Very helpful. Got it. And, I guess, it’s what leaves some of the back end with your EPS guidance year-over-year. And then, Scott, maybe just for you. I mean, honestly I was surprised on the consumable number considering Heartland did kick in. I know you’ve got a lot of moving parts. But to an earlier question, can you just be a little bit more specific? On the sales and marketing investment in Dental, is that specific to reps? And if so, is it specific to reps in regions where you may have cut and maybe over cut, if you would? And then, the other question, we’d just be taking a step back and looking at the market. I think last quarter you went down the road a little bit more stable versus strengthening. As we sit here three months later, what’s your current perspective on the overall dental market? Thanks guys. Scott Anderson Yes. Thanks, Jon. So a little more clarity. We’re going to be very selective in terms of – and I would say the other piece of this is we just have richer information starting to flow out of our ERP system that, I think, is going to help us make better strategic investments in terms of hiring. But this is not just a sales rep strategy. This is also an omni-channel, digital, outbound telesales. There are many different ways that we can address the entire market, and that is part of the strategy. I would say to the overall market, I would say the dental market is still very stable. Once again, I will use sort of our strength this year in core equipment, up nearly double-digits, as sort of a bedrock of the stability of the space. And I would say just this disruption period around technology is a very short-term headwind that leads to a lot of opportunity on the back half. So we’ve got our own work to do and we’re diligently doing it. And I think our dental team is very excited to turn around the profile and start growing again. Operator We will take our final question from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies. Your line is open. Brandon Couillard Hey, thanks. Good morning. Scott Anderson Hi, Brandon. Brandon Couillard Scott, just a conceptual question for you on the ERP three parts. Number one, can you describe how customers will experience a change with the new ERP system? Number two, how will it help you really sell more products and do so more efficiently? And number three, is there any elements of the new system that can help you optimize pricing in a better way? Scott Anderson Yes. Great, Brandon. Let me talk a little bit holistically about ERP and hopefully I’m going to hit all three of those issues and if I don’t, I’ll come back to it. But obviously, this is a big undertaking for the organization. It was one of our key strategies we’ve discussed back over five years really since I moved into the role. I’ve had a lot of business mentors and fellow CEOs that have counseled me that these transformations are not for the faint of heart, but really, and this gets to your question, the power of the business tool upon completion is worth the journey. And it’s worth the journey for customers, employees and, ultimately, the owners of the company. I would say when you look at the customer benefits, one of the things we’re excited about is the ability to tailor the customer experience in a more personalized way. And that looks to things like self-service for the customers, scheduling online, richer data that customers can use to drive their practices, the ability for our sales reps – and our best reps are great business consultants. How do we leverage that data to help our customers? Obviously, with richer data and richer systems, you can make smarter business solutions as well. And I think if you look at the growth story of Patterson over 25 years, really strong leaders in technology and sales execution, but the discipline, that really is going to be important for any company to compete and win in the modern marketplace. It’s how you use the information you have as a company to help your customer and just the richness of the tool we’re going to have on the other end creates that opportunity. And I think you can see the type of talent as well that we brought into the organization in terms of some really high-end marketing talent that come from industries that have experienced these evolutions. One of the things I love about Patterson is we were trailblazers. And I go back to my early days as a sales rep installing electronic ordering systems pre-Internet back in San Francisco. So over 80% of our business today comes to us electronically, but we have an opportunity to take this to a whole other level and that’s why getting the plumbing right, the infrastructure right and making that investment now is so critical. Brandon Couillard That’s helpful. Thank you. Scott Anderson Thanks Brandon. Operator I will now turn the call over to Mr. Scott Anderson for closing remarks. Scott Anderson Thanks, Shayla, and thanks, everyone, for your time this morning. We look forward to updating you to our progress on our next call. Operator That concludes today’s conference.

Operator Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to PetSmart’s Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions following at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. And now I’ll turn the conference over to your host April Lenhard, Director of Investor Relations. Please begin. April Lenhard Good morning everyone. Joining me on today’s call are David Lenhardt, President and Chief Executive Officer and Carrie Teffner, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. David will discuss our third quarter business performance and then Carrie will review the details of our profit improvement program, our third quarter financial results and our earnings guidance. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open up the call for questions. Please limit your time to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. Before I turn the call over to David, let me remind you that today’s call, including the question-and-answer session, includes forward-looking statements regarding our expectations for future operating and financial performance, plans, strategies and similar matters that are subject to the Safe Harbor statement for forward-looking information you’ll find in last nights earnings release. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those factors identified in the release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and we do not undertake any obligation to update our forward looking statements. In addition, during today’s discussion, management will comment on both actual results and certain non-GAAP results. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP results to the most comparable of GAAP results are available in the earnings release we issued last night which is available on the Investor Relations homepage on our website at petm.com. And now, I will turn the call over to David. David K. Lenhardt Thank you, April and good morning everyone. Before I begin, I suspect some of you have questions regarding the status of the Board’s review of strategic alternatives announced following the second quarter. As we announced in our press release last night, the process is ongoing and we do not intend to provide an update or discuss the details. That is all that we are going to say at this time and we will not be taking questions on the topic on this call. Turning to our third quarter business performance, from a sales perspective during the quarter, comp store sales were flat with average ticket increasing 2.4% and comparable transactions decreasing 2.4%. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02, which excludes one-time costs associated with the profit improvement program increased approximately 16% compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.88 in the prior year period. I am pleased with our progress to-date across our four growth strategies and in taking decisive actions to deliver expected annualized pre-tax cost savings of $200 million under our profit improvement program, which Carrie and I will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. Turning to our growth strategies, I want to update you on our progress in each of the four areas. Strengthening our leadership position is the destination for pet food, growing our proprietary and exclusive products and services, further developing our omni-channel capabilities and developing a more personalized customer experience. As it relates to strengthening our leadership position in pet food, offering the right balance between widely distributed and channel exclusive foods is an important element to our success. As we've said in the past, we reduced space in our stores and our marketing away from grocery and mass foods to support the growth in channel exclusive foods. As we monitor the results of our actions, our analysis show that customer who buy grocery and mass brands were negatively impacted more than we expected. These customers are important to us, because they represent over 70% of the consumables market. They cross shop the store and we have a proven ability to trade these customers up to channel exclusive foods over time. To ensure we continue to attract and retain these customers, we took actions during the quarter to rebalance our grocery and mass foods by expanding the shelf space in our top 700 widely distributed foods stores and we also increased the presence of grocery and mass foods in key drive aisle locations in all of our stores. From a marketing and messaging standpoint, we implemented more focused messaging, highlighting our broad assortment of widely distributed and channel exclusive foods and our price leadership position in digital and print circulars, promotional TV and personalized e-mails. We also made changes to our media mix to shift more spend into digital and radio to allow more efficient targeting of specific key customer groups. Although it’s early days, we are encouraged to see stabilization in our grocery and mass foods sales trends as a result of these actions. Going forward you will see us continue to highlight these messages across specific target groups. With respect to proprietary and exclusive product sales and services sales, I’m pleased with our continued growth in each of these areas, which represent a key competitive advantage for us. Proprietary and exclusive product sales grew double-digits to 28.5% of merchandise sales, up more than 200 basis points from the third quarter last year with improvement across all three divisions, consumables, hard goods, and specialty. This improvement was driven by strong double-digit growth in consumables led by our own proprietary brand Simply Nourish, as well as growth in hard goods driven by our exclusive Bret Michaels and Martha Stewart assortments and in specialty led by National Geographic. Based on our strong year-to-date performance and pipeline of innovation, we remain confident in our ability to deliver double-digit growth in proprietary and exclusive products sales over the next three to five years. On the services side of the business, sales continue to outpace the core with growth of 6% driven by grooming and PetsHotels. Services had both positive transaction and average ticket growth due to various promotional and pricing strategies to drive sales, as well as our innovative and differentiated offerings. For example, our new skin solutions package expanded Pet Expressions treatments and seasonal Halloween packages in grooming and Halloween night camp service in hotels, which we did for the first time this past Halloween. In grooming, we’ve been developing technology to improve the customer experience and I’m pleased to report that we are now in the pilot phase with online reservations for booking grooming appointments in a 130 stores across the chain. This capability is a unique differentiator that no other major pet retailer offers and it delivers key features and benefits for both our customers and associates. Customers can now book appointments with their favorite groomer in just a few clicks. They receive e-mail and text reminders for appointments and service completion and with their pet profiles information stored in the system, it will allow for a seamless customer experience across all stores. We expect to fully deploy this capability across the chain in 2015. In the omni-channel space, we are excited about our opportunities to leverage our leadership position to enhance the customer shopping experience and remain relevant to the customer however, wherever and whenever she chooses to shop. Consistent with our efforts to expand our online presence and capabilities, we closed the Pet360 acquisition in September. The combination of PetSmart and Pet360 creates the number one place to reach pet parent online. As a result, we now account for over 40% of all pet website traffic. In addition to the e-commerce platform and fulfillment capabilities that Pet360 brings, its broad rich content sites allow us to leverage our offerings across customer touch points. And the innovative digital media programs position us to monetize traffic to our sites and capitalize an unparalleled access to pet parents. As part of the acquisition I am pleased to welcome Brock Weatherup, former CEO of pet360.com to the PetSmart team as SVP and Chief Digital Officer reporting to Phil Bowman. Brock brings tremendous leadership experience focused on strengthening the digital relationships with our customers and will oversee all of our digital marketing, mobile and digital product development. We also completed the rollout of key omni-channel capabilities during the quarter that allow us to leverage our store base. Excluding Pet360, our omni-channel sales which include e-commerce as well as our new omni-channel capabilities grew nearly 70% during the quarter, driven by higher conversion rates in our new in-store pickup capability. The customer response to buy online pickup in store has been positive, because it gives them the ease and convenience of shopping online without having to wait for the product to be delivered. It also drives traffic into our stores giving customers the opportunity to purchase additional items when they pickup their online order. We're the only major pet retailer that provides this convince and we will continue to explore ways to capitalize on this capability. During the quarter, we also completed the rollout of mobile devices in all of our stores to facilitate in-store customer orders of extended aisle and out of stock products and we're leveraging these devices to engage with our customers in more personalized ways. Like capturing special moments in our store with our moment’s photo app and e-mailing those photos to the pet parent. In fact, we just did this during our Halloween weekend event and took more than 60,000 photos in our stores and our customers loved it. As it relates to building a more compelling, personalized and connected customer experience, membership in our PetPerks program grew high-single digits to nearly 21 million customers. We are leveraging our customer database to provide relevant and increasingly personalized communications. This includes sending e-mails to lapsed widely distributed food customers and to new pet parents and providing targeted POS coupons at the register. Last month, we also announced GSD&M as our new creative agency, they have a long track record of success with large retailers who have strong relationship brands. We're excited to work with them to bring our brand purpose to life through powerful and emotionally rich content across all media beginning in early 2015. In addition to our four growth strategies, we announced last quarter that we're taking important steps to fundamentally restructure our cost base to facilitate greater efficiencies and profitability. After a thorough review of our operations and activities, we're targeting annual pre-tax cost savings of $200 million under our profit improvement program. We expect to fully implement these profit improvement actions by the end of fiscal year 2015, which should result in the realization of approximately 60% of the annual savings in 2015 with the full value expected be realized in 2016. We have already begun taking action to achieve our targets under the program through overhead cost reductions undertaken during the third quarter, which Carrie will speak to shortly. In closing, I’m confident that we have the right growth strategies and the operating plan in place through our profit improvement program to drive enhanced shareholder value going forward and I’m pleased with our progress against these objectives. As we head into the 2014 holiday season I’m excited about the work that the teams have done to bring the holidays to life in our stores with gifts and services for every type of pet, including stylish costumes, fun holiday treats and innovative services packages to pamper your pet. And now, I will turn it over to Carrie to provide you with more details of the profit improvement program, our financial results and our earnings guidance. Carrie. Carrie W. Teffner Thanks, David, and good morning everyone. First, I will provide you with more details on the profit improvement program and then I will discuss the third quarter financial performance. At the end, I will provide updated guidance for the fiscal year and fourth quarter and an early view of our guidance for 2015. Turning to our profit improvement program, following a comprehensive review of the enterprise cost structure that began last spring, which involved engaging key partners including A.T. Kearney, we launched our profit improvement program as communicated on our Q2 earnings call. As David mentioned, this program is expected to deliver annual pre-tax cost savings of $200 million by the end of fiscal 2015. We expect approximately 60% of the annualized savings to be realized in 2015, and the full value to be realized in 2016. These savings will be realized within both cost of goods sold and OG&A expense. We’ve already began to achieve our targets under the program through overhead cost reductions taken during the third quarter. This included the elimination of 176 positions or approximately 10% of our support group and field leadership positions as well as our corporate aviation department. As a result of these actions, we’ve realized approximately $2 million in savings during the quarter and anticipate an additional $5 million in savings in the fourth quarter with a total of $20 million in annualized savings related to these actions expected in 2015. Going forward, we expect to deliver additional profit improvement program savings by reducing costs within cost of goods sold, logistics, store operating and other corporate costs. In total, we expect to incur one-time charges of approximately $30 million as a result of these actions with a substantial portion of these charges incurred in fiscal 2014. During the third quarter, we incurred approximately $16 million in charges related to the program including severance charges, impairments, consulting fees and other one-time costs. Turning now to our results for the third quarter, total net sales were $1.7 billion representing an increase of 2.6% over the same period last year. As David mentioned, comparable stores sales growth was flat with average ticket increasing 2.4% and comparable transactions decreasing 2.4%. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted comp sales by approximately 35 basis points and inflation was a 120 basis point headwind. With respect to our sales mix, as a reminder, the specialty category includes the live pets as well as the consumables and hard goods associated with these specialty pets. During the third quarter of 2014, our sales mix included consumables at 50.2%, hard goods at 26.7%, specialty at 11.3%, services at 11.2% and other revenue at 0.6%. For comparison, our sales mix during the third quarter of 2013 was consumables at 49.8%, hard goods at 26.7%, specialty at 12.0%, services at 10.9% and other revenue at 0.6%. On a year-over-year basis consumables penetration was up 40 basis points versus Q3 last year, hard goods was flat, specialty was down 70 basis points and services was up 30 basis points. Gross margin for the quarter was 29.4% representing 35 basis points of deleverage compared to the third quarter last year. Within the gross margin line, services added 45 basis points to the overall rate driven by improved safety claims as a result of safety programs the company has been focused on over the last few years, as well as lower incentive and medical insurance costs. Merchandize margins were down 45 basis points due to a combination of mix and rate at approximately 45% and 55% respectively with rate impacted by increased coupon promotions. Warehouse and distribution costs were 15 basis points unfavorable, primarily due to costs associated with our new Bethel distribution center. Rent and occupancy costs were 20 basis points unfavorable. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 20.8% of sales, flat compared to the same period last year, included in OG&A expenses were 90 basis points of one-time charges related to the profit improvement program, which included consulting fees, the shutdown of our corporate aviation department and severance-related costs. These charges were offset by savings associated with our profit improvement program. Lower incentive compensation and expense management partially offset by increased advertising. GAAP earnings before tax was $138.5 million or 8% of sales, non-GAAP adjusted earnings before tax, which excludes one-time costs associated with the profit improvement program, totaled $154.6 million or 9% of sales, up approximately 11% compared to GAAP earnings before tax in the same period last year. The tax rate for the quarter was approximately 38%. As a reminder, when I provided guidance for Q3 and the full-year 2014 on our Q2 earnings call, I did not include any assumptions for the impact of the Pet360 acquisition or for the profit improvement program, to help with comparability I will provide the GAAP diluted earnings per share as well as the non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes the one-time cost associated with the profit improvement program. It is worth noting that the results of operations of Pet360 subsequent to the acquisition date are included in our third quarter financial results and are not considered material. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.92. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share, which I remind you excludes one-time costs associated with the profit improvement program totaled $1.02 up approximately 16% compared to GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.88 in the same period last year. Turning now to the balance sheet, at the end of the third quarter, we had $255 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and zero borrowings on our credit facility. Our cash balance reflects the acquisition of Pet360 during the quarter. During the quarter, we also distributed $19 million in dividends and did not purchase any shares. We ended the quarter with average inventory per store of $618,000 up 1.8% compared to the third quarter of last year. From a cash flow perspective we generated $125 million in cash flows from operating activities during the quarter. Depreciation and amortization expense for the quarter was $59 million and we spent $37 million on capital expenditures. We opened 36 new stores and closed two stores, we opened a 11 microstores including seven urban in-fills. Of the 25 standard format stores we opened in the quarter 21 were 12K format stores. We also acquired a store through our acquisition of Pet360 called Only Natural Pet in Boulder, Colorado, bringing our total store count to 1,387 stores. We opened one PetsHotel during the quarter bringing our total to 201 PetsHotels. Turning now to our guidance for fiscal year 2014 and for the fourth quarter, as I mentioned before, I will provide guidance on a GAAP basis as well as on a non-GAAP adjusted basis, which excludes the one-time costs associated with our profit improvement program to help you better evaluate our ongoing operating and financial results. For fiscal year 2014 we are expecting comparable store sales growth to relatively flat and total sales growth in the low-single digits. We expect GAAP earnings before tax growth can be in the low-single digits reflecting gross margin deleverage and OG&A leverage. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per before tax growth is expected to be in the mid-single digits excluding approximately $23 million and one-time charges associated with the profit improvement program. We anticipate the tax rate to be around 38%, GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $4.24 to $4.29. Please note that our guidance assumes no additional share repurchases during the year. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $4.39 to $4.43. Capital expenditures are now expected to be between $140 to $150 million. For the fourth quarter 2014, we are expecting comparable store sales growth to be slightly positive. GAAP earnings before tax growth is expected to be between flat to low single-digits reflecting gross margin deleverage and OG&A leverage. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings before tax growth is expected to be in the mid-single digits, excluding approximately $7 million and one-time charges associated with the profit improvement program. We anticipate the tax rate for the fourth quarter to be between 38% and 39%. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $1.30 to $1.34 and non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be between $1.34 to $1.38. While it is still early, as we typically do in the third quarter, we wanted to provide you with some initial high level guidance for next year. For fiscal year 2015, we expect to deliver Comparable store sales growth of low-single digits, GAAP earnings before tax growth is expected to be in the mid-teens with meaningful gross margin in OG&A leverage driven by the profit improvement program. Note that this includes approximately $7 million in one-time cost associated with our profit improvement program. I also want to point out that Pet360’s revenue will be included in our calculation of comp store sales beginning in the third quarter of 2015, once we hit the anniversary of the acquisition, until then it will be reflected in net sales growth. We expect to provide further guidance for 2015 on the Q4 call. Before we open it up for questions, I would like to reiterate my confidence in our operating plan to deliver value to our shareholders through our growth initiatives and our profit improvement program. We have the right team in place to execute on our targets and I believe we are well positioned to continue driving earnings growth. That concludes our prepared remarks; I would like to open up the call for questions. Thank you. Question-and-Answer session Operator [Operator Instructions] First question is from Seth Sigman of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Seth Sigman Okay, thank you. If I could just follow-up on the outlook. Carrie, the mid-teens EBT growth for 2015, it seem that based on the cost cuts that you have outlined $120 million that drives much of that growth despite positive comps. Is there an implication that maybe there are some offsets that some of the benefits from the cost cutting actions will be redeployed elsewhere maybe through more aggressive pricing or other investments? Any color there would be helpful. Carrie W. Teffner Sure. With respect to the cost improvements impacting 2015, you’re right that is partially offset for a couple of different reasons. One, as we’ve outlined the growth initiatives that we’re focused on, obviously we’ll continue to invest against those. The other element which is something we've talked about throughout 2014 and what has benefited us in terms of OG&A is the fact that we’re missing our plan target relative to EBT growth and comps. And as a result, incentive expense is lower in 2014, so part of the offset to 2015 is the fact that we do need to reset that. So it’s a combination of that and continued investment in the business really what’s driving the guidance. Seth Sigman Okay, and anything specific on the pricing side. Are you anticipating any major changes in your strategy there? Carrie W. Teffner No, I think I’ll let David jump in here to talk a little bit more about our zone pricing activities, but beyond that typical pricing activities that we would normally do each year would be what is in our guidance. David did you want talk about? David K. Lenhardt Yes. Seth, this is David. One of the things we’re going to begin to deploy next year is zone pricing. We have a national pricing strategy right now that’s been a pricing strategy that we’ve been optimizing over the last several years with a tool called Khimetrics. We do think we have an opportunity with zone pricing and we've been engaging earlier this year with a firm called Parker Avery that really help us develop the right strategy and we’ve selected a tool to help us implement that’s called Revionics, they have experienced with many retailers doing this and so we’re going to beginning to deploy that in Q1 of next year and would expect to roll that with consumables next year. So we’re excited about that. Seth Sigman Okay. Great thanks. I’ll let someone else jump in here. Operator Our next question is from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is open. Michael Lasser Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you look through all the sources of cost reductions that you’re going to have over the next couple of years, should there be any potential dyssynergy associated with them? Is there a risk that  it  could impact the business? And then along those lines, what is going to be driving the costs of goods benefit? Are you going back and renegotiating some terms with vendors or is there another way that you’re getting there? Thank you. David K. Lenhardt Yes, Michael, it’s David, I’ll start and then have Carrie follow-up, it’s been really important for us as we've thought about the profit improvement program to absolutely make sure we’re striking the right balance in terms of the cost reduction and continuing to invest in the business and we feel very good that we can continue to focus and invest in our four growth strategies while we are at the same time delivering the profit improvement program and you see that reflected in our guidance. So we feel very good about that balance. Carrie W. Teffner Yes, and so what I will add to that is one of the guiding principles that we've been following as we put together our cost reduction program, our profit improvement program, has really been to maintain a lens of customer experience and ensuring that we don’t do anything to harm that customer engagement that we have in the store and so this has been a really deliberate bottoms up approach, we've brought in third-parties to assist us with sizing the opportunity and prioritizing the work that we’re doing and to give you a little more color in terms of where the savings are coming from, and how that will show up over the next couple of years. On a run rate basis, so when we get to 2016 approximately 40% of the benefit is going to be realized in cost of goods sold and that’s really going to be split between the product cost itself, as well as warehouse and distribution and transportation, okay. And then other 60% will show up in OG&A and then specific to 2015 the way to think about that 60% that we’re going to realize next year, approximately one-third of those savings will be in cost of goods sold, the other two-thirds will show up in OG&A. And if you think about the OG&A area, I’ll just call out a little bit more detail there, so you can understand where we expect to see those benefits. One of the key areas that we’ve talked about is the store operating models and as we think about the store operating model, we’re looking at things and this is where we brought an outside partner to really help us in terms of expanding some of the Lean Six Sigma work that we started last summer with ASU in developing a Lean Six Sigma program with them. We have about 45 Greenbelts in the organization and we brought in a group called Peppers & Rogers, who are a part of TeleTech, which is a leading global customer engagement company. And really that’s helping us extend and accelerate a lot of work that that we’re doing around there. So as we think about the store operating model, we really think about the labor in the stores, making sure that we have the labor in the store when we've got the customers in the store. We also think that we have opportunities to drive efficiency with all the processes and procedures in the store as well as the way to better allocate our resources more effectively between the associate hours and management hours. And then is again the rest of the OG&A is really going to come from work that we’re doing with A.T. Kearney over really leveraging the indirect spend more effectively across the organization, as a $7 billion company, we have a lot of opportunity to really benefit from the scale of our purchases more so than what we’ve done in the past. And then you’ve already heard us talk about the 10% reduction in overhead, as well as the elimination of the aviation program and we have some continued efficiency opportunities in the overhead portion of the organization. Michael Lasser The detail is great. Thank you so much. My one follow-up question is I think we can definitely understand where the margin side is going to come from next year, but you are guiding to also a low-single digit comp. So can you bridge where you think the drivers are going to be for the low-single digit comp, is it going to come from traffic, or it will come from ticket or how should we model that out and how should we think about it? Thank you. David K. Lenhardt Yes, Michael, it’s David. As we look at the comp, I go back to the four growth strategies that we’re pursuing. I think overall next year as you look at it, you are going to see that’s a combination of traffic and ticket. I think that the areas that we’re focused on again strengthening our leadership position in food. We would expect to see some improvement on our food sales and we’ve started to see widely distributed, the mass and the grocery brands stabilize in this last quarter. We feel good about the progress we’ve seen there, as we have again focused on adding back a little bit more space to those brands, but also messaging more powerfully the broader assortment that we have from a specialty side and we’ve talked about specialty has been a business that for the 18-months we’ve seen the overall market decline; we have seen improvement in our specialty business this quarter sequentially, we saw about a 250 basis points improvement in the specialty comp and so that gives us some encouragement there. And from an omni-channel perspective, as I look at the capabilities that we’ve been working on for about 18-months now that we are now deploying into the stores, we’re starting to see very good customer reception there that’s helping to drive our overall omni-channel sales. Very specifically order online, pickup in store, which has now been in our stores for about five weeks across the entire chain. This was the number two capability that our customers asked us for when we talk to them about how they wanted to relate with us and we’re seeing a very good response as we give them the convenience again to order it online, but pick it up in our store on the way to work or when it’s convenient with them. So I think you’ll see a combination of that. Carrie W. Teffner Yes, the other thing that I would add that we’re really excited about within our services area with the online reservation system that we’ve got out with 130 stores right now. We’re really excited about that that’s going to drive growth in 2015, the service business again given that’s the key differentiator for us, we continue to invest and innovate in that area. Michael Lasser Thank you very much. And good luck with the rest of the year. David K. Lenhardt Thanks, Michael. Operator Our next question is from Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Stephen V. Tanal Thanks a lot guys, this is Steve Tanal on for Matt Fassler. One thing on the Pet360 acquisition, would you mind sharing the impact on 3Q sales and earnings and also your thoughts for 2015 as we think about our model? Carrie W. Teffner Relative to sales impact in Q3, Pet360 generated about $7 million in revenue and they were slightly dilutive to the EPS in the quarter. And then if we think about 2015, what we’ve indicated previously as we expect our annualized sales to be about a $100 million. Again, consistent with how we talked about it and what we shared on the Q2 call, we do continue to expect Pet360 to be dilutive in 2015. However, we do have a part of profitability in 2016 where we expect it to be accretive in EPS and that’s really going to be driven by leveraging the buying power of PetSmart across the Pet360 platform, also optimizing the logistics and fulfillment cost base, some back office synergies as well as media revenue business, which is a high margin portion of a business, the growth that we expect there. Stephen V. Tanal Very helpful, thanks a lot for that. On specialty you know the penetration was down a bunch year-on-year, I guess it sounds like its getting a little bit better, but do you care to call out sort of what is behind that? David K. Lenhardt Yes, I mean again, we have seen overall the market decline as we've talked to the key vendors which make up the large majority of the industry, we do believe we are performing better than the overall industry, we've been pleased with National Geographic that’s been a key propriety brand that we've brought into that business and that’s been doing well. So we've seen some improvement and we continue to focus on it. Stephen V. Tanal Got it. Is it still the aquatics and that sort of stuff… David K. Lenhardt The center aquatics is the largest portion of the specialty business and that has been the center of the decline. Stephen V. Tanal Got it. And just lastly, the traffic trend is still a little bit obviously less good than you sort of wanted to be and we're kind of curious if what you think the drivers are and why maybe some of the grocery efforts are not showing up in traffic if that’s kind of the key culprit if you will. David K. Lenhardt Yes, specifically on the grocery food activities that we've been doing, we have seen those trend stabilize, so we're pleased with the early progress there. Overall we're not happy with where the traffic trends are, we're very focused on reversing them and as we look at that I think we continue to see one challenge consumer, we are seeing continued declines in traffic to shopping centers and that is impacting us. And as we've said before we do know that the pet customer has more choices out there today, as they look to find a place to get food and get supplies and we're very focused with our growth strategies going forward on being relevant to that customer and separating ourselves from the competition and we feel good about the strategies we're going after. Carrie W. Teffner And just to put a little bit more color on it, we made a lot of the rebalancing changes within Q3 and also enhanced the marketing in Q3. So its still early days and we've got more work to do, but we're headed in the right direction, we feel very confident with the growth initiatives. Stephen V. Tanal All right. Thanks a lot guys. Operator Thank you. Our next question is from Seth Basham of Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. Seth Basham Good morning. Carrie W. Teffner Good morning. David K. Lenhardt Hi. Seth Basham Can we dig deeper into the cost cut plan for next year. You mentioned first of all on the COG side both product cost and Warehouse and distribution and transportation. Maybe segment out that a little bit more and give us some examples of where the costs might be cut? Carrie W. Teffner Sure, so if you think about - within cost of goods sold, the product cost I think that’s pretty straightforward. We’re looking at the overall end-to-end costs with our vendors in that negotiation process, we typically do that in the fourth quarter of the year. So we’re underway with that that process. I would say that’s the larger portion of the savings within the cost of goods sold piece of the business, followed really by the supply chain operational optimization opportunities. And as we think about those opportunities it’s really more through the lens of when you are in the distribution, you can optimize the inbound and outbound flow of your shipments, your pick break slotting chart structure that you have in your DC to match the store profile, their servicing, damages. There is a number of activities within the DC that we’re looking to continue to optimize. And then within the transportation elements, it’s really looking at pulling out the difference between the prepaid freight as appose to with respect to inbound as appose to outbound, it’s looking at routes, it’s looking at the lanes and optimizing those that’s looking at truckloads, all those types of things. So it’s really getting down in the details and looking at those and we’ve had help in that process to help us identify those opportunities. And we face those over the 2015 and 2016 year, so that we’ve got an opportunity to make sure that we do this in a methodical and sustainable ways. Seth Basham Gotcha, that’s helpful. If you think about the product cost savings I would assume that you do this every year in the fourth quarter you renegotiate with vendors. Now what’s different about the magnitude of the opportunity now? Carrie W. Teffner Yes, it’s a great question, we have great relationships with our vendors, we do negotiate every year. I think one of the things in the environment that we’re in. We think we have more of an opportunity this year to really look at the total cost end-to-end. We’ve probably been more focused on TPRs and in vendor funding for marketing and those types of things, more so than really looking at the overall cost. And so that’s where we’ve brought in A.T. Kearney to help us and really done a deep dive into the performance of each of the individual vendors and understanding how they’re doing against the peer, against the media and then where we believe they have opportunities and that’s really how we develop the bottoms up build in terms of the savings opportunity that we have here. Seth Basham Got it. And then last follow-up on the SG&A side, the cuts that are coming there, you’ve seen very good SG&A leverage over the last five years, but you still see significant opportunities going forward. Is there something in the labor structure in particular that you see that creates an opportunity, was there a lot of inefficiency before that you’re now planning on correcting? Carrie W. Teffner Yes, what I would do is get back a little bit and get some perceptive in a four, five, six comp world and your leveraging OG&A that’s great. I would say you have a different lens on cost when you are in a five comp world then when you are in a flex comp world or one comp world. And so, I wouldn’t say necessarily inefficiencies, but definitely more opportunity to go after than what we’ve gone after in the past. And one great example of that is, when you look at all of the indirect spend, we do have a procurement organization, but we’ve really not elevated it to a strategic sourcing organization and leverage their expertise across all the spend opportunities we have in the business. A great example of supplies, we've spend a significant amount of supplies, we have thousands and thousands of SKU level detail on supplies, we’ve rationalized that base, we're rationalizing the vendors and with that come scale and then leverage capability. So it’s really those types of opportunities and then as I mentioned relative to the store operating model, again leveraging the partners that we have in Peppers & Rogers, we are executing [Kaizen] studies in the stores to really understand the efficiencies of the processes and where we have opportunities, multiple touch points, how we can provide that store operators better tools to help them be more efficient. So we have a number of pilots underway currently in the stores and again that’s something that we’ll wrap up relatively slowly over 2015. Again, because we are very mindful about the customer experience and wanting to make sure that our associates have all the opportunity in the world to engage with the customers when they are in the store and so this is really about taking that other work off and making the other work more efficient for them. Seth Basham Got it. Just to clarify and I will pass it on. Within the OG&A plan savings, how much of it is from store operating model versus indirect spend? Carrie W. Teffner I would say, I haven’t called that out and I prefer not to at this point. Seth Basham All right, thank you. Operator Next question is from Peter Benedict of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open. Peter S. Benedict Hi, guys thanks for taking the questions. First, just curious to what you are seeing in inflation, how that kind of trended in the quarter. I apologize if you already spoke to it and then your view of inflation as you kind of have these comps getting better over the next quarter and into next year. Carrie W. Teffner Yes, we haven’t really talked about that much about inflation, so we saw about 20 basis points of inflation in the quarter and that compared to a 140 basis points in inflation in the third quarter last year, we’re assuming relatively similar level of inflation through the rest of this year and as we think about 2015 we’re not assuming that we’re back at the run rate of 150 to 200 basis points. Peter S. Benedict Okay, Carrie, but you think there could be still some or maybe an uptick in inflation as we look to next year. I’m just trying to get a sense in for kind of inflation… Carrie W. Teffner Yes, we really haven’t assumed much, certainly we all hope, but we’ve not assumed much. Peter S. Benedict Okay, okay that’s helpful. Just looking at some product categories specifically on the fresh, frozen and raw area of the store, you guys have been rolling a bunch of that stuff out. Can you talk about how those categories are trending, what kind of the customer profile is, who you are seeing kind of buy those products and are they shifting from other product in the stores or are they new customers for you? David K. Lenhardt Yes, Peter it’s David. Yes those introductions of that new innovative products we did as part of the consumable reset earlier in the year, we’ve been very pleased with the customer response and the sales, it’s absolutely where we expected it to be. And I would say we’re seeing the combination, we knew that this would absolutely bring in new customers, but we’re also seeing customers trade-up into that and again as we see the continued humanization of pets, people treating their pets like family. This is another one of those human trends we've brought into the pet world and the idea of having fresh food is something that customers care about. So it’s been a mix. Peter S. Benedict Okay, perfect. And then just last question is on unit growth. We think of plans for 2015, can you talk about maybe that blend between the larger and microstores. Also locationally kind of urban versus rural, it sounds like you’ve been all about more urban this year, but just your thoughts in terms of the opportunity particularly in that rural market. And have you guys thought about even doing something smaller than the 6K to 7K is that something that’s in the works. Thank you. Carrie W. Teffner Yes, as we think about 2015, we’re thinking probably around 75 net new stores and that would be a mix probably more weighted towards the standard format stores, but still a good number probably around the 30 plus mark in terms of micro format stores and those would be mix of in-fills as well as small market stores, haven’t called out specifically how many in each although the pipeline is pretty well set. And then relative to discussions around even smaller format store, with the acquisition of Pet360 we acquired a small format stores about 3,000 square foot, Only Natural Pet in Boulder, Colorado. I think we’re going do some learning and it’s certainly something we’re talking about, but at this point have no plans to start rolling out stores smaller than the microstore right now. Peter S. Benedict Okay, that’s perfect. David just one follow-up if I could, I apologize. Just back to the fresh, frozen, raw when you think about the category expansion for going forward. Do you think you’re going to adding additional space, I know you have Nature’s Variety in there you’ve got Freshpet are there additional coolers you’re planning to add, do you think there is any opportunity over in the cat area of the store, just your latest thoughts on that. Thank you. David K. Lenhardt Yes, I mean you know space allocation is something that we look at, our merchants look at. We feel good about the pipeline of innovation that continues to come in the food area. And again, driven by this humanization of pets and so I think as we bring in new products we’re going to look at the different areas of the store and optimize as appropriate, clearly we look at different business and how they’re performing and we would look at what’s appropriate based on that to make the right productivity decisions, but feel really good about continued pipeline going forward. Peter S. Benedict Okay good fair enough. Thanks very much. Operator The next question is from Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer. Your line is open Brian W. Nagel Hi, good morning. So I just want to drill down a bit more on the merchandize margin trend. As we've seen here in Q3 for a while it’s been weaker, as you think about the cost control incentive you‘re starting to putting in place now. Will that help merchandize margin or is that more focused on some of the other areas that where fixed cost, and then with merchandize margin maybe take into consideration that drivers or the weakness lately, how should we think about that within the context of your preliminary 2015 guidance? Carrie W. Teffner Yes. So within our profit improvement program, the portion that’s related specifically to product cost, obviously we do expect that to have a beneficial effect on product margins, but the other thing to keep in mind in what we've seen every quarter is that as consumables continues to grow faster than the other categories that does continue to create a drag on the overall merchandize margins, but other than that I would say one of the other opportunities that David discussed briefly at the beginning part of the call was really around the implementation of zone pricing, so we also think that that will help with our overall margin management and then so - I think I’m missing the second part of your question, but those are the key areas that we're focused on there. Brian W. Nagel I guess that gets there, so as you look at that 80 basis point decline in merchandize margin here in Q3, is there a way to break that apart between the mix shift to consumables and then other factors? Carrie W. Teffner Well with what you said relative to the overall merch, the margin rate is that with our 45% of it was related to mix and 55% of it was related to rate. Brian W. Nagel Okay. Carrie W. Teffner And that was a 45 basis point decline in merch margins versus Q3 last year. Brian W. Nagel Okay. Well I appreciate. Thank you. Carrie W. Teffner Okay. Operator Next question is from Alan Rifkin from Barclays. Your line is open. Alan M. Rifkin Thank you very much. With an acceleration in both the new microstores as well as the 12K stores, does part of the cost cutting initiative possibly include converting or relocating some of the largest stores to one of these two formats? Carrie W. Teffner Actually, we have a really robust real estate process, and I know I have mentioned that on previous calls. Almost 99.5% of our stores have a positive four-wall cash flow and approximately 60% of those stores have four-wall cash flow of over $1 million and as part of the process of evaluating both new store openings as well as store closures, we typically close anywhere from two to five per year, so we're constantly pruning and improving the store base to make sure we're fine-tuning and taking out those stores that are less productive. Also we probably relocate or downsized a couple of stores a year as well, as key in looking at those is really round four-wall profitability, comp productivity, whether its an A location and those types of things. Certainly we're not going to sacrifice an A location to downsize the store to a B location, but we continually look at that. So no major changes at all plans relative to our store opening process. Again, it’s an extremely robust process with a really healthy portfolio and we feel really good about our ongoing procedures keep us in the right place there. Alan M. Rifkin Okay, I appreciate all the color that you’ve given with respect to the profit improvement program, but cutting it a different way how much of the $200 million in savings is fixed in nature versus variable, how much would you realize irrespective of revenues or not? Carrie W. Teffner So with respect to the cost down in OG&A, those are really irrespective of revenue, I mean those are cost reduction just like the reduction force we just took in September where we will deliver $20 million in annualized savings has nothing to do with revenue growth. And then as we’ve estimated the COGS transportation supply chain improvements we’ve done that off of baseline of this year’s sales if you will, in this year’s performance level and so we’ve not factored in savings associated with if we sell more we get a bigger cost reduction benefit. So, it’s really been off of baseline of this year and last years tight performance. Alan M. Rifkin Okay one last quick one if I may. What are long-term effects of zone pricing in your opinion on margins. How much do you think you can realize from that? Carrie W. Teffner I would say we haven’t called out a specific amount, I think we still have a lot to learn. I think that’s a better question for us at the back half of next year. So but we certainly think it will be accretive to margins. Alan M. Rifkin Okay, thank you very much. David K. Lenhardt Thanks Alan. Operator Thank you. We have time for one final question. Our final question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Peter J. Keith Hey thank you and good morning everyone. David I want to ask you a big picture question on the channel-exclusive foods. We’ve noticed there is been proliferation of some of the organic and green freeze with the mass brands. And I’m wondering if you are starting to see a slowdown in that trade-up theme that we’ve seen for a number of years with regard to your channel-exclusive brands. David K. Lenhardt We continue to feel very good about our ability to trade customers up. We’re also seeing as we think about the traditional national channel-exclusive brands that they are continuing to be channel-exclusive, there absolutely is as you said in the mass channel some “natural brands” being introduced. That again is where we think it’s really important for us to continue to highlight the broad assortment that we have, our pricing positioning as well as the experience we have in our stores in the education our associates can provide around food. And we think that again is a big differentiator, but we absolutely continue to see our ability to trade up customers. Peter J. Keith Okay that’s helpful and then just lastly I wanted to just get a refresher on how to think about your e-commerce business going forward here? So I think your e-commerce business grew by 25% last quarter, I’m not sure if you said it earlier, but could you quantify what the growth was in Q3 and then where we are as e-commerce as a percent of sales right now? David K. Lenhardt Yes, we saw our e-commerce, as we call it our omni-channel revenue increase to 70% this last quarter and as we look at that that includes PetSmart.com revenue that excludes Pet360 revenue and that includes both sales online, but also sales that have been ordered online and picked up in-store, which was the key new capability that we deployed over the last quarter, which again we know was our customer’s number two most requested capabilities. So that absolutely is helping to drive growth along with improving conversion on our PetSmart.com website and that’s been a very big focus for us. So we’re encouraged by the early reception from our customers, we’re the only Pet specialty retailer to have to order online and pick up capability and that’s something that we’ll continue to capitalize. Separately on the Pet360 side, again very excited about that acquisition, we've begun the backend integration, our intend is absolutely to keep the front-end separate, they would bring us three e-commerce websites along with six content sites and we really like what that will bring us over time in terms of engagement with our PetSmart customers and so for example PetMD, PetMD is the leading pet health and wellness site in this space. You will see us pretty soon start to take that content and start to integrate it into e-mails that we’ll send our PetSmart customers, you will see us start to integrate it in the PetSmart.com. So we feel good about the capabilities we’re going to be able to leverage going forward with Pet360 as well. Carrie W. Teffner And then the later part of your question within Q3’s results our e-commerce business, again the total omni business including Pet360 is little more than 1% of our sales. Peter J. Keith Okay, yes I did hear you say 70% then it seemed quite impressive number, so as you’ve now rolled out the buy online pickup in-store to all stores, is that number going to accelerate as we go forward into Q4 in 2015? David K. Lenhardt Yes, I think we’re going to continue to see good growth in e-commerce, I think it’s early days and we’re going to see how this all evolves with the customer and how the customer chooses whether they want to order online and have us ship it directly to their house, whether they want to order online have it picked up in the store, do they order it through the tablets that we have. I think we’re going to continue to see how that customer behavior evolves, but I would anticipate we’re going to continue to see nice growth in our e-commerce businesses. Peter J. Keith Okay. That’s great. Good luck this holiday season. Thank you very much. Carrie W. Teffner Thank you. A - David K. Lenhardt Great, well thank you everyone. I think we have come to an end and I just want to thank you for joining us today. Wish everyone a happy holiday season and we look forward to speaking with you next year in March. Thank you very much. Operator Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude the conference for today. Again, thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect. Have a good day.

My name is Steve, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time,   I would like to welcome everyone to the PPD's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Luke Heagle, Executive Director of Investor Relations. You may begin, Sir. Luke Heagle Good morning, and welcome to PPD's second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. In our comments today, we will refer to selected non-GAAP financial measures for all period discussed today unless specifically noted, net revenue, SG&A expense and margins exclude reimbursed out-of-pocket and equity compensation expense. For a quantitative reconciliation of all non-GAAP numbers discussed in today's call to the most comparable GAAP measure, please see the reconciliation information that is posted under Presentations and Events in the Investors section of our website. I'd like to remind everyone that except for historical information, all of the statements, expectations and assumptions discussed in today's call are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Actual results might differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Information about factors that could cause actual results to vary is disclosed in the press release announcing our results and in the SEC filings for PPD, copies of which are available free of charge from our Investor Relations department. I will now turn the call over to our Executive Chairman, Dr. Fred Eshelman. Fredric N. Eshelman Thanks, Luke and good morning to you all. It is our pleasure to report second quarter 2011 results. The team will give you details in a few minutes. But first, I’d like to hit some highlights and make a few comments. As Luke noted, I will be referring to certain non-GAAP numbers, which do not include reimbursed out-of-pockets or equity compensation expense. Year-over-year total revenue grew 10.2% and operating margin improved 368 basis points. RFP flow for the first half of 2011 was up more than 40% versus the first half of 2010 and the competitive hit rate improved over 500 basis points. The sales cycle did appear to lengthen somewhat. We had a very solid sales quarter of $753 million, and despite higher than normal cancellations we had a book to bill of 1.29. Backlog grew 14.2% year-over-year to a $3.685 billion. DSO remained in the mid 20s at 26. Looking at the segments for clinical development sciences we significantly reduced SG&A as a percent of revenue year-over-year. Gross margin held up above our 50% target and operating margin improved 462 basis points year-over-year. Clinical revenue grew at 14.1% versus Q2 of 2010. On the lab side, revenue grew 8.1% year-over-year, but importantly grew 10.6% versus Q1 of 2011. Gross margin deteriorated due to lower than expected performance in the Vaccine Lab and BioDuro. G&A was reduced as a percent of revenue year-over-year, but due to the gross margin fall, overall operating margin continued below that of 2010. However versus Q1 of 2011, operating margin improved 226 basis points. So the business is performing well with exception of vaccines in BioDuro and Dr. Babiss is available to share our plans and efforts there. As to the CEO search, we have identified good candidates and the process of interviewing and selecting continues to move forward. As I have noted previously, we are focused on finding the right candidate unless so on the speed of the process. You all saw the recent press release regarding our ongoing strategic and capital structure review. Our board including our new directors requested this review. We’ve hired a financial advisor to assist with the review including advising us on potential ways to unlock value for shareholders. As noted in our release, this review does not envision a combination with another CRO. The review continues and of course we will update you if and as appropriate. Now, we will hear from our CFO, Dan Darazsdi. Daniel G. Darazsdi Thank you, Fred and good morning. Net revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $376.2 million in the second quarter of 2011. We delivered year-over-year net revenue growth of 14% in our Clinical Development Services segment, and Laboratory Services segment net revenue increased 8% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. The sequential increase in Laboratory Services segment net revenue was due primarily to growth in our bioanalytical lab, Phase I clinic and global central lab. We expect Laboratory Services segment net revenue growth to remain strong on a sequential basis throughout the year. Foreign exchange positively impacted net revenue in the second quarter converted at average second quarter 2010 rates net revenue would have been $6.6 million lower. Backlog increased 14% year-over-year at quarter end and breaks down by client type as follows: 77% pharmaceutical, 17% biotechnology and 6% government and other. The weighted average backlog duration at the end of the second quarter was 33 months with our backlog conversion rate to revenue increasing slightly to 10.5% of beginning backlog. Cancellations and adjustments for the second quarter were considerably higher than recent quarters, due in part to a $43 million cancellation for a global clinical trial. This cancellation was due to the sale of a compound by a mid-sized pharma company prior to start of the trial. Our gross margin for the second quarter was approximately 50% driven by continued strong gross margin above our 50% objective within our Clinical Development Services segment. Second quarter SG&A expense as a percent of revenue was soft on a sequential basis, including $1.5 million related to the elimination of excess space in our Latin America clinical development services business and consolidating our EMEA and Asia-Pacific information technology call center services and our existing call center in Sofia, Bulgaria. Our entire management team continues to focus on all SG&A spending to drive productivity gains as we deliver revenue more efficiently. Operating margin increase to 16.5% in the second quarter, Clinical Development Services segment operating margin of 18.2% remain strong for the quarter. And Laboratory Services segment operating margin increased over 200 basis point sequentially to 10.8%. Increased investment to support the future growth of our drug discovery services business, BioDuro and soft net revenue in our vaccine and biologic center of excellence continue to pressure Laboratory Services segment operating margin in the second quarter. We expect the Laboratory Services segment operating margin to continue to increase throughout the year driven by strong sequential net revenue growth and operating efficiency. Foreign exchange negatively impacted operating income in the second quarter, converted at average second quarter 2010 rates operating income would have been $3.8 million higher and operating margin would have been over 100 basis points higher. Our second quarter equity compensation expense was $5.0 million. Other income for the quarter was $0.3 million tend to remain relatively low, mostly due to nominal yields on our investments. Our investment in Celtic Therapeutics generated income of $10.6 million during the quarter due primarily to an increase in the fair market value of the funds investment. We expect the impact from this investment to be positive in both the third and fourth quarters of this year. The effective tax rates for the second quarter was 32%, but should be within our guidance range for the balance of the year. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2011 were $0.41, which included a $1.3 million loss on investments. Cash flows from operations for the quarter was $18 million and was impacted by significant income tax payments in the quarter and an increase in DSOs to 26 days outstanding. Capital expenditures were $26.0 million including investments in our new bioanalytical laboratory in Richmond, Virginia for dedicated client demand of $10.5 million, our vaccines and biologic centre of excellence of $3.5 million, BioDuro of $2.4 million and our cGMP Labs of $2.1 million along with the investments in technology and our facilities. We finished the second quarter with a strong balance sheet including $440 million in cash and short and long-term investments and no debt. This concludes my remarks. I will now turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Sharbaugh. William J. Sharbaugh Thank you, Dan. We made solid progress executing on our operational initiatives during the second quarter, and our Q2 performance is a direct result of our focus on top line growth and productivity improvement. We continue to generate solid net revenue growth year-over-year in both business segments while controlling SG&A costs and expanding our Laboratory Services segment operating margin. we are maintaining financial discipline. our pricing philosophy remains unchanged and we are selling on value and quality to maintain strong margin delivery in the years ahead. Our continued client focus and operating flexibility resulted in strong growth authorizations for the quarter, and we are seeing signs of improving market conditions. We experienced very strong RFP activity in Phase II through IV during the quarter and our hit rates improved. RFPs received were at a record high in terms of the absolute number and the dollar value. Two observations are worth noting: first, our strategic partners made significant contribution to growth authorizations for the quarter. Secondly, we saw sizeable awards from biotech companies, which signaled at funding is showing signs of recovery. We continue to see a shift in revenue from North America to emerging markets and our global revenue profile for the second quarter with a 55% North America versus 45% rest of world. Second quarter net revenue breaks down by therapeutic area with oncology as our largest, followed by cardiovascular, endocrine and infectious disease. Our top client represented less than 10% of year-to-date revenue, our top five clients accounted for 36% of year-to-date revenue, and the top 25 clients accounted for 74% of year-to-date revenue. Headcount increased slightly to a 11,253 at quarter end. I will now review the second quarter performance of our Clinical Development Services and Laboratory Services business segments. Clinical Development Services segment net revenue grew 14% year-over-year and the operating margin remained strong at 18.2%. We delivered solid year-over-year net revenue growth in all regions with the strongest growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific remains a key growth area for us and I’m pleased to welcome Edward Ian to PPD as Vice President of Clinical Development Services for Asia Pacific. He will provide strategic and operational leadership for our clinical business in this important region. During the quarter, we renewed our focus on quality and continuous improvement fostering our culture of operational excellence is vital to our future success and this is reflected in our number one ranking amongst CROs in CenterWatch’s 2011 Global Site Survey. We were also pleased to receive the 2011 Microsoft Life Sciences Innovation Award for PPD 3D, which is a virtual collaboration technology designed to improve the cost effectiveness, speed and quality of clinical trial training. Turning to our Laboratory Services segment, net revenue for this segment increased 8% year-over-year and 11% sequentially. Operating margin improved 226 basis points sequentially and we expect continued operating margin expansion through out the rest of the year. But Phase I clinic recovered nicely from unexpected cancellations in the first quarter delivering strong sequential net revenue growth. The bioanalytical lab and global central lab also delivered strong net revenue growth on a sequential basis. This month, we opened our new purpose build laboratory in Richmond, Virginia to support vaccine testing and its state of the art facility is expected to contribute solid top line growth in the second half of 2011. The GMP Lab also performed well during the quarter adding 15 new clients across our U.S. and Ireland locations to drive future growth. Second quarter gross authorizations were strong for our Phase I clinic bioanalytical lab and GMP lab and exceeded internal targets. Overall lab backlog increased 8% year-over-year. The soft areas were BioDuro and the vaccine lab. BioDuro delivered a slight increase in year-over-year revenue and the vaccine lab delivered a slight decrease in year-over-year revenue. Both delivered lower than expected gross authorizations. While performance did not meet our expectations, we anticipate both businesses to improve throughout the remainder of the year. We have strengthened our business development and scientific expertise at BioDuro, and we are late stage discussions with two large pharma companies for strategic partnerships within our vaccine’s lab. We expect Laboratory Services segment net revenue growth to remain strong on a sequential basis. It’s driving operating margin expansion in the second half of this year. That concludes my comments and we are now ready for your questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Hi, thanks very much. Could you just give us a review of how you view competitive pricing dynamics at this point across your various businesses? Are they getting better? Are they getting worse? And how do you feel, how does that influence your view about ability to drive margin improvements over the balance of the year? Fredric N. Eshelman Dan, you’re going to take that? Daniel G. Darazsdi I will take that. I would say principally when we look at pricing, we are continuing to put forward our value proposition as we always have. We don’t see a lot of change in our response from a pricing view point. We are taking our pricing forward with the focus on supporting our value proposition. I think that’s been really consistent, you’ve seen that, we’ve had a nice uplift in authorizations, and through this process we are maintaining our pricing philosophy and discipline. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. That’s great, thanks. Some of the proposal flow comments that you mentioned were very encouraging. If you look at that improvement across different client segments, where do you see the most notable improvement, is the improved business are really coming more from the larger pharma companies or from the smaller client basin? And I guess there would be a similar question around hit rate. Did you see your hit rate improve across both of those client classes or more in one versus the other? William J. Sharbaugh Yeah. I’ll go ahead and take that one. Obviously, we’re seeing an up-tick from our strategic partnerships, which we think is a promising sign. If you look at the quarter, a little over half of our second quarter net revenue, growth authorizations and a large chunk of our backlog are from the strategic partners. So we’re certainly seeing those partnerships and large pharma contribute. I did mention that we saw some signs of life from smaller biotech companies, which could be an indication of fundings picking up. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Yeah. And the hit rate question, Bill, pretty consistent across both classes? William J. Sharbaugh Yeah. As Fred mentioned, he gave some specific numbers. Our hit rate looks really good and we saw year-on-year and sequential improvement there. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Okay. Fredric N. Eshelman Yeah, John, this is Fred, just to quantify that a little bit. I think as Bill noted, as the strategic accounts really begin to pick up and contribute more both revenue and authorizations, we should expect to see some up-tick in the competitive hit rate because if we happen to be in an account where there are only two major players, then by definition, you get under most circumstances about 50% of what they have. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Makes sense. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs Thanks for the questions. I think one of the question obviously in everyone's mind is around the idea of unlocking value and understanding it's a very fluid process at this point, but I was wondering, Fred, if maybe you could just take a step back and help us understand the motivation around the timing to have the management team evaluate the strategic plan at this point. Fredric N. Eshelman Well, as I indicated and as we indicated in our press release, our Board and in particular our new board members of which there are three, thought it would be a very good time to have a strategic review not only in interest of the company and shareholders, but also as somewhat of an educational exercise for the new directors. Naturally, while we were doing that and while we were putting together extensive plans and numbers and so forth and so on, it became pretty obvious that, that would be a good time to see, are there other ways that we could unlock value for shareholders given how the stock price has performed. And having said that, that’s about all the comments we can make on that, and I guess I'd have to refer you back to our press release. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs No, that’s fair. I appreciate the additional color. You guys also mentioned, I believe that conversion was lengthening somewhat. I guess could you talk a little bit about what the driver there was, and how are you guys thinking about conversion of backlog going forward? Daniel G. Darazsdi The conversion and backlog actually is quite good. I mean, we came in with a 33 month conversion rate on backlog, that’s in line actually a little bit better than it’s operated on a historic level, and the revenue conversion was quite positive. William J. Sharbaugh Yeah. Bob, I think what you’re referring to, Fred may mention that the sales cycle was lengthening a little bit, conversion is pretty steady. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs Okay, good. Thanks for the clarification. And the last one I have is just on Celtic, you know obviously it’s something that you guys had mentioned should fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, I think the previous expectation of was that it would be neutral to slightly positive clearly a little bit more than that this quarter. Can you maybe just give us a sense of how much visibility you guys have into the earning stream from Celtic? Is it something where you can actually see ahead of a quarter, what the contribution is tracking at intra quarter or is it something you get once every three months? Fredric N. Eshelman This is Fred. It’s not an earning stream, it’s a revaluation of assets which they have to do, and they have a lengthy process that they go through with market research consultants who come up with numbers and then of course those numbers are vetted with a major big for accounting firm to come up with the actual numbers. So that’s how that occurs. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs And I guess, is there any clarity on the expectation around that for the rest of the year? Fredric N. Eshelman Dan? Daniel G. Darazsdi You know, we think at this point, this is a place that’s going to fluctuate in full challenging the (inaudible) .  But we think over the next couple of quarters is like, we to be just slightly positive, and of course that can fluctuate. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs Great. Thanks for the question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Todd Van Fleet with First Analysis. Your line is open. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Hi, good morning, guys. I’m just curious as to what your view was with the impact of the softness in vaccine and BioDuro in the quarter in terms of kind of margin impact or EPS impact, if you could articulate that for us would be helpful. Lee E. Babiss Yes. I’ll take that, and good morning. This is Lee E. Babiss. Let me touch on the vaccine area first. Since the end of last year, we’ve seen growing interest amongst the major pharmaceutical companies that are doing vaccine work to outsource more of their lab work. And we believe we're poised to capture that because of not only   the credibility of the technological capabilities we have in outlying facility, but also by the experience the 120 scientists have there having contributed to bringing four vaccines to the market while working at Merck. We believe we have all of the platforms and the technical know-how in place. We primarily focus on prophylactic vaccines and there we have all assays in place in support of vaccines under markets as well as those in clinical trails today. We’re also working with government in support of epidemiological studies, and we’re investing and enhancing our PBMC and biorepository capabilities. The Merck relationship is in year three of a five-year contract and that work is going well. We have signed on an additional large pharma client into three-year deal working at molecular efficacy by PCR as well as SBA testing. We have another large pharma client authorization that we plan to close this week and it’s up the same magnitude of the previous one that I just described. We have either completed or are doing pilot studies with all of the major pharmaceutical companies in the vaccine space as well as the midsize biotech’s as well. All of the reports that we’re getting from those are leading to again, small term contracts as well as very positive feedback in terms of our abilities relative to the competition. We continue to expand our capabilities in terms of platform testing, enhancing our biorepository   capabilities and also poising ourselves to capture the emerging therapeutic vaccine R&D market. From a network perspective, the network is expanding very nicely. Bill talked about our (inaudible) capabilities during vaccine work and the large contract we have there and that’s now expanding into a GMP area as well. So overall, we feel very good about the vaccine work as a growth drive that’s starting in Q3 of this year. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. That sounds great. I guess I’m curious as well as to the performance because you had mentioned both the vaccine and the BioDuro business kind of hitting gross margin in the quarter. I would guess just based on the results that the short fall relative to your expectations in those two business segments was more on the expense side of the equation or the margin performance for that business rather than the revenue, although it sounds like though maybe that’s not entirely accurate and the way you’re talking about or ramp up or the expected ramp up for those businesses in the back half of the year. So the, I guess, what I’m saying as the overall margin performance for the business was below what we expected in the June quarter. You had would mention vaccines and BioDuro’s being of particular areas of softness relative to your expectations, I’m just trying to get to articulate what the shortfall was relative to your expectations? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. Well, let me go ahead and face that. I think the point that we’re trying to make here is, our historical core laboratories are performing very well and meeting the expectations. What you have you know with BioDuro and the vaccine lab are two new businesses for the company. We’re making strategic investments in those businesses. In the bottom line, at this point in time you know we don’t have as much revenue growth to offset the investments that we’re making hence our margins are little bit lower than we want them to be. But what you here is a lot of confidence based on conversations with client and contracts that we’ve been in discussions with or closing over the course of this year and into the second half of the year to give us confidence that those two business units within our lab segment are going to improve thereby bringing up the entire segment. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. Fredric N. Eshelman This is, Fred. I think you know folks are trying to get us to quantitate this somehow in this quarter, since we called this as being a negative impact so, do you have an estimate of what the impact might have been between vaccines and BioDuro. Daniel G. Darazsdi So, we haven’t really both forward direct impact on the margins from those specific businesses. I think the, one thing that we have really tried to highlight is that on a go forward basis in the third quarter and fourth quarter we’re expecting revenue growth to be strong from both of them in addition to some other parts of the prior business we’re expecting [bio way] to before be positive and our central lab to deliver strong. I would say just in general, with out the drag from those two businesses we would be approaching our 20% operating margin target for the segment. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. If I could just ask one follow on then related to that. So thinking about the incremental margin for the new revenue that you expect to start moving through those businesses. I think it’s probably fair to say that it’s substantially above the corporate average overall, would it be fair to say that the incremental margin attached to the incremental revenue flowing to those businesses is north of say 40% or so. Fredric N. Eshelman Are you talking about on the gross basis or operating… Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Operating… William J. Sharbaugh I’m not sure you can draw that conclusion. I think the, probably what you are looking to is you know our labs in general have stronger variable contribution when you start to get revenue growth, because of the overhead that’s already absorbed. So, yes as you get revenue growth it definitely gross margins in those lab businesses and lab businesses in general to try to break it up specific to the labs going to do that, but I think the insight of what I gave relative to what the quarter, that the quarter would have approached our targeted 20% with out that drug should provide pretty good insight. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. Dan just quickly, what’s your share count you’re assuming for the year, full year? Daniel G. Darazsdi Share count for the year is 117 for the full year average for the diluted shares. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co. Thanks. Most of mine have been covered. Just a quick one recently one of the privately held bioanalytical competitors received some fairly serous FDA warnings and it’s in a process of working with the clients over the last five years to retest or those clients will need to retest all bioanalytical studies. I’m curious if things like this can be a positive short term drag for you in terms of your bioanalytical sales activity and how you respond to situations like this when a tremendous amount of rework needs to be done in this market place in a short period of time. Thanks. William W. Richardson Eric this is, Bill. It’s the opposite effect here at PPD, it’s not a drag our quality record in our bioanalytical lab is stellar. We have the FDA in there. I think last quarter and certainly had them in there last year. So, I think one of the value propositions for PPD is our quality record. So, we don’t see that as a drag or a potential problem Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co. Actually maybe I didn’t state the question well. I actually was asking the client, the pharma are going to have to rework all of these bioanalytical studies that were done at that Houston facility for your competitor since 2005, and my question is whether that could actually drive a (inaudible) unexpected one time work and how you would attack that if it is an opportunity? William J. Sharbaugh Well, I don’t know the specifics of that particular client and what they need to reset. I can tell you that our doors are open if they want to bring our way. Fredric N. Eshelman Well, I think that if it’s a very quick push through, obviously it depends on whether or not those particular assay is validated or whether or not we have to start from scratch. But we had a similar situation some years ago that did in fact result in an up tick in our business. Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co. Thanks, Fred. I was thinking the DNDS situation might be a good analogy at present for what could happen here, but I’ll take it offline. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of James Kumpel with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Good morning. I want to first start out with cash flows and see if you’re comfortable that second half operating cash flows and free cash flows will be need for improvements over the first half. Daniel G. Darazsdi Hey, James its, Dan. Let me just provide some additional details around cash. Cash from operations was $18 million lower than you know previously historically kind of delivered, and we had a significant tax payment in the quarter and just to kind of calibrate that a little bit for you, US and foreign tax was paid for around $30.6 million in Q2 and to give you some past sides around that first quarter was around $2.4 million and second quarter was tense to be a higher cash tax payment quarter was about $16.1 million. So that you know really it needs to be taken into consideration plus you know we have a bit of an up tick in DSOs, but I think as you hopefully appreciate you know we are really running a best-in-class and I think DSO delivery we’ve had significant improvement in that, its going to move around from time-to-time, but I think our DSOs are operating you know sub 30s and with the 26 DSO on the second quarter year-to-date basis. I think that is still pretty good number, but it did stress the cash flow for the current quarter a little bit expecting to get back on track nicely in 3Q and 4Q. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets And can you give us sort of some parameters for what you’re looking at on free cash flow this year? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well, we’re not just in the guidance that was previously issued. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets And I guess with regard to guidance you know originally was you guys looking kind of break-even for Celtic so what it make sense to adjust the quarterly going forward basis for the expected contributions or are you going to kind of stick (inaudible) that just want various moving parts. Daniel G. Darazsdi Well, you know clearly in the second quarter we had a benefit from Celtic, but on a go forward basis 3Q and 4Q we’re expecting it to just being normally positive and you know that can fluctuate as evidenced in the second quarter, but we’re not expecting that at this time. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Okay. With regard to the strategic which are clearly helping in terms of new authorizations, can you help us understand whether are not you know some of the potential clients are asking you for upfront investments in new capabilities and staff that some of your competitors can ask to do for particular strategic deal? William J. Sharbaugh Yeah, I’ll go ahead and take that one. You know the bottom line here for PPD is you know we’re very diligent in terms of making decisions about augmenting staff. It needs to be done in contract with the work, and when we sign a strategic partnership that doesn’t unlock (inaudible) of hiring what unlocks a   (inaudible) of hiring is a concrete authorization from that strategic partnership, so we are doing it in concert with our new business. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Okay. And just finally Fred, if you can comment a little bit as to whether or not you’re seeing out in the marketplace any type of virtual outsourcing deals maybe aligned   earlier this year that foresee a significant uptick in outsourcing levels? Fredric N. Eshelman Are you referring to FSP type deals or…? James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets No, I am thinking more like with regard to Align or maybe the level of outsourcing as a percentage of R&D is going to pick up meaningfully somewhere they should historically been. Fredric N. Eshelman I think it varies client by client as you well know some clients are making big cuts primarily around mergers. Other clients are up ticking just a little bit. So on balance I think we generally model some very little overall increase in R&D for Pharma higher for biotech. I think we are seeing more enquiries around innovated ways to outsource both including taking over functions or gradually win-win down capability within and picking it up without. There is some FSP activity. So it’s all over the board but there is a lot of noise in the good sense as I think you know from the huge up-tick in RFPs. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital Hi, good morning. Just Dan, you highlighted the target operating margin for the last segment is around 20%. I was just curious when you think about where you are today given the business flows that you’ve seen and some of the investments you have to make. What’s your sort of internal planning in terms to get back to that level? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well Doug, you know I think you’d really have to look lab by lab but I think you know when I step back and look at the lab performance it’s going to come from number of areas Lee touched on some but look, I think we’re going to have strong revenue growth and Bill has articulated I think very clearly the great opportunity we have with the Bioway lab and the fact that that new capacity is coming on line, on schedule, DCL lab is working to have some nice growth. Our core labs are looking to improve from a revenue delivery viewpoint and of course, that brings with it some scale advantage as revenue comes online. and I think we do a pretty good job of driving productivity. So we’re looking to get some revenue ramp in the labs, and that’s going to come with increased operational efficiency and operating margin delivery and then I think we talked very clearly expectations for vaccine and biologics center of excellence and BioDuro come up. So I think that’s how the whole model works. Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital And then when you look at the margin in the clinical services business, to what extent, has the company been forced to carry some additional headcount in order to meet the requirement of some of the strategic partnerships? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well, to my former comment, let me back it up with some evidence. If you look at our headcount at the end of Q2, 2010 was 10,902, I just told you that at the end of this quarter, a year later it’s 11,253, that is 3% year-over-year headcount growth. So as I said, we’re going to hire in concert with the actual authorizations that we win and what we’re looking to do is obviously to grow our headcount appropriately to service those clients, but if we can keep our SG&A to support that growth below our growth rate, then we’re in good position. So we’re doing it prudently, carefully, but appropriately. Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital And when I look at that headcount, those headcount numbers look very good relative to the top line growth, the margins in the Clinical Service segments are down from where you were at the end of last year. So I’m just sort of curious as to what you see as the key drivers for getting back to where you are? William J. Sharbaugh Well, our goal is to take that 18.2% we mentioned for clinical development services and get it up to our historical target of 20%. We’re going to do that, the old fashion way, we’re going to watch our cost structure and we’re going to deliver for clients with excellence, we’re going to keep our pricing philosophy here in tact and we think that with a lot of focus on productivity and operational improvements, we can bring those labs or those margins backup to 20% and that’s what we’re aiming to do. Daniel G. Darazsdi Correct. And I mean to Bill’s point look on the clinical development side, I think that business has been performing well, we’re expecting to get revenue growth over the next couple of quarters and that will come up with some SG&A efficiency, I think we’ve demonstrated a good ability to generate and support the revenue growth with really strong SG&A management and you know just as you take a look at the second quarter, recall that we did have a couple of expenses that head into the second quarter of $1.5 million I talked to which we’re going to generate a positive benefit on a go forward basis. But in the quarter that did push SG&A up a little bit. (Inaudible). Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital Okay great. Thank you very much, Dan. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Sandy Draper – Raymond James Thanks very much. This question relates to some of the earlier ones around the Celtic and I know you guys don’t tend to change guidance a lot or tweak a lot. I’m just curious how you thought about it, I think at the beginning of the year you weren’t really factoring in any material contributions from Celtic you obviously got it about, looks like about $0.06 this quarter. Is that just sort of a number you are willing to absorb, is that number sort of offset the weaker performance of BioDuro and Vaccines sort of how did you think about that in terms of the full year numbers. And then the second question would be I know you’re not anywhere close to talking about 2012, but when we think about the lower margins in the first half of this year to get your guidance you’ve got to have significantly better margins in the second half of the year. Is there anything in the first half of the year that would need to repeat itself and that sort of the year-over-year comps you need to factor that in or will as you improve the business in the second half of the year should that sort to be opened to be equal a new water mark for speaking about where you’re entering in 2012. Thanks. Daniel G. Darazsdi Hi, Sandy it’s, Dan. While doing that question we’ll share have a couple of points. I think the first part around Celtic and how we think about that and if you go back and look and we don’t talk the guidance unless we’re changing, we haven’t changed it. So, I would say in the Celtic assumption we said our earlier expectations would be pretty nominal and then maybe generate some benefit in the fourth quarter. As we look at it now, we did obviously generate some additional benefits in the second quarter, but we’re expecting it to be pretty nominal in 3Q and 4Q. So and fair it would isolate that in the second quarter I’d say we had positive contribution from Celtic and we had some challenges that weren’t not expected in the labs specifically in Vaccine and BioDuro, and we always puts and takes and that’s a little bit of what happened in the second quarter. So going forward we’re expecting to improve relative to the labs delivery, we’re not expecting to have that kind of a repeat from Celtic on a go forward basis. And at this time, we’re not talking about 2012 in terms of guidance or outlook. So probably not comment on that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Unger with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up question on headcount. You did mentioned that the headcount is up over 3% year-over-year, your backlog is up 14% year-over-year and the duration I believe you mentioned is shortening a little bit. Is there a metric that is it is a capacity utilization or some sort of hiring, sort of bullish that we should be expecting in the future I am curious as to why the headcount growth lag so much to backlog growth? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well I think it’s good management on our part look we mentioned it before but Dan I sit down for every single SG&A add or replacement in the company and you know that’s run by Fred. We are being very careful there. We are certainly not turning off the stick it in terms of operational revenue generating hiring. So we are doing that in concert with the business as appropriate remember there is a lag between an authorization and ultimately the – towards the peak run rate of that contract. So this is a case of modulating your hiring to being concert with when you need it. I think that we are doing a good job and we are in the sweet spot right now doing what we do well here at PPD. William J. Sharbaugh Yeah, let me just add to that as well obviously on the clinical side especially as it relates to margins its all about hiring just in time and training just in time we overshoot we got a problem with G&A undershoot you can’t perform. Generally speaking cancellations are bad news however if you do have a higher the normal cancellation remember that we didn’t have capability that pulls half of those projects and is available for other projects which can also make the numbers look a little bit funny for you know a short period of time and as to your question about is there a metric, we look at certainly, we look at illustration across every single part of our business and we know where it needs to be within the particular segments. So that absolutely is a metric that we follow closely. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Is that utilization at the moment optimized I mean are you feeling that you are getting the maximum utilization that you would prefer at the moment. William J. Sharbaugh Well no because I generally like to set that number to 120%. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. Got you. Just a follow up on that question, as far as direct costs are concerned your direct cost went up $10 million sequentially in the quarter, whereas the headcount was up roughly about 100, is there something else that’s going in the direct cost that we should be thinking about that outside of headcount that is ramping in the business? Daniel G. Darazsdi It is Dan. I will take that Steve, I think the – for your question most help me better understand exactly what you’re trying to get out with your question. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Sequentially your direct cost went up $10 million but headcount was only up 100 people I’m assuming you’re not paying those people during the quarter? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. So, those – there is two things one is utilization which is effective but the other one is recall that April 1 is annual merit cycle increase. So, those – that merit cycle hits April 1 and so you have a full quarter of solid increase. I think that helps kind of bridge that for you and thus far I want to clarify the question. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Great. Okay and then is the bulk of the incremental investment in BioDuro is that behind us, is – are you going to continue to ramp investment going forward to the reminder of this year in BioDuro? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah, second take that, no I think the bulk of the investment in BioDuro has been completed and as you know the primary investments went into enhancing some of their technological capabilities as well as two big investments that we’ve made in the regeneration space one with TBL a small biotech company was whom we formed a joint-venture to provide clients with best in class monoclonal antibody therapeutics and that’s preceding well. And then the other is a – an investment we’ve made in a company called [XCAM] which has also regeneration platform for small molecules based on DNA based chemistry. So, both of those investments are in place and now we’re trying to realize the reap the benefit from those investments. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Got you. And then finally Dan and as far as the – the tax rate is concerned for the back half of the year could you remind us what the guidance is? Daniel G. Darazsdi We’re expecting the – the tax rate to get back to within our guidance range and the full year tax rate for the 2011 initial guidance was 29% to 31%. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets 29 to 31, great. Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. and we expect to operate during the back half of the year. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Great job guys. Thanks. Daniel G. Darazsdi Yes. Operator Your last question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies & Co. Your line is now open. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. On strategic partnerships, I’m looking at your comments about, I think you said more than 50% of your revenue coming from the strategic partnerships, but your client concentration is relatively stable sequentially. I was hoping you could just expand a little bit on perhaps the number of those the diversity of the types of deal they are, i.e., project driven versus FSP driven and how you are I guess able to see more stability in your backlog conversion in light of the contribution in these strategic partnerships? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. Dave, what I mentioned was second quarter net revenue in growth authorizations that a little over half way from our strategic partners. Remember, we obviously segment our customer base, so when we talk about strategic partners, we have sort of some different tiers there. But the bottom line is I think what we suggest it would play out is playing now. We’re seeing good volume from these partnerships as they mature, as they reach their run rates, and you know as Fred said, that’s helping our hit rates obviously a little bit. And if you even look at our labs, we’re seeing some spill over into the labs as well. So when you look at top clients in the labs and compare them to clinical development, you see a lot of the same companies, which we think is a good thing. Our view is that, over time we hope that those partnerships are going to mature to where we hope they can go, and when you’re just one of a couple of providers with these big pharma companies, there’s a lot of potential. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. Thank you for that. Corollary, I suppose in the lab business, I think because of some strategic partnerships maybe not fully from those, you seem to have pretty solid line of sight to some specific revenue sources that were going to contribute to your back half ramp. And it sounds like one has begun in July. I wondered if the others of those are also holding pretty firm to your expected start dates on things like central lab, the Richmond biolab et cetera? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. I think we talked to it, that we’re having all the right discussion with all the right players. There is a couple of contracts that are in the later phases stages of negotiation and hopefully award. So we feel really good about the second half of the year. And as we said, we’re going to obviously grow revenue and improve the margins on our last segment. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. If I could just end, couple for Fred. Fred, I’m wondering if you can comment to the value enhancing option review, do you expect that that review will result in an action without saying what that action would be, will there be an action or could it be no action? Fredric N. Eshelman I can’t really comment beyond what was in the press release and what I said earlier today at this time. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. Okay. And then also at the Board level, can you comment on what the key qualities you are looking for in the CEO search, it sounds like you’ve nailed it down, you’re moving forward with some candidates. I’m hearing some things about those candidates that they are kind of financially oriented people. And so I’m curious about what qualities you would define is the most important? Fredric N. Eshelman Well, when we started out, we had pretty much agreed with the Board and the search committee that they were somewhere around ten attributes that we would like to see and obviously you have to sort of use and no one is going to score a 100% in every category. and so you give and take a little bit, but financial acumen, I rate very high on my list, because in my view whoever is running the place has got to understand the numbers, be ahead of the numbers and be able to immerse themselves in those at all times. I think it’s clear whoever comes in needs to know healthcare whether it’s this specific business or not is another matter, but certainly know something about healthcare pharma biotech and so forth, we need somebody who is generally speaking a Type A plus personality who is after at everyday, because this business will get away from you if you’re not careful and on and on and on. So we’ve got these attributes lined up, we know what they are and that’s how we are screening folks. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. That’s fantastic. Thank you, Fred. Operator This concludes the Q&A portion of today’s call. I’ll turn it back for closing remarks. Fredric N. Eshelman Okay. This is Fred. Thank you all very much for being on the call. Our view is that the business is doing very well, it’s coming along as planned. The laboratory weaknesses we have outlined specifically the rest of the historical labs are performing well in terms of margin and so forth. So we know the job ahead of us, we know what we have to do, and as usual at PPDs and execution story. So again, thank you very much and we look forward to talking with you soon. Good bye.

Thank you!", 'qAndAText': "Operator (Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Hi, thanks very much. Could you just give us a review of how you view competitive pricing dynamics at this point across your various businesses? Are they getting better? Are they getting worse? And how do you feel, how does that influence your view about ability to drive margin improvements over the balance of the year? Fredric N. Eshelman Dan, you’re going to take that? Daniel G. Darazsdi I will take that. I would say principally when we look at pricing, we are continuing to put forward our value proposition as we always have. We don’t see a lot of change in our response from a pricing view point. We are taking our pricing forward with the focus on supporting our value proposition. I think that’s been really consistent, you’ve seen that, we’ve had a nice uplift in authorizations, and through this process we are maintaining our pricing philosophy and discipline. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. That’s great, thanks. Some of the proposal flow comments that you mentioned were very encouraging. If you look at that improvement across different client segments, where do you see the most notable improvement, is the improved business are really coming more from the larger pharma companies or from the smaller client basin? And I guess there would be a similar question around hit rate. Did you see your hit rate improve across both of those client classes or more in one versus the other? William J. Sharbaugh Yeah. I’ll go ahead and take that one. Obviously, we’re seeing an up-tick from our strategic partnerships, which we think is a promising sign. If you look at the quarter, a little over half of our second quarter net revenue, growth authorizations and a large chunk of our backlog are from the strategic partners. So we’re certainly seeing those partnerships and large pharma contribute. I did mention that we saw some signs of life from smaller biotech companies, which could be an indication of fundings picking up. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Yeah. And the hit rate question, Bill, pretty consistent across both classes? William J. Sharbaugh Yeah. As Fred mentioned, he gave some specific numbers. Our hit rate looks really good and we saw year-on-year and sequential improvement there. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Okay. Fredric N. Eshelman Yeah, John, this is Fred, just to quantify that a little bit. I think as Bill noted, as the strategic accounts really begin to pick up and contribute more both revenue and authorizations, we should expect to see some up-tick in the competitive hit rate because if we happen to be in an account where there are only two major players, then by definition, you get under most circumstances about 50% of what they have. John Kreger – William Blair & Company, L.L.C. Makes sense. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs Thanks for the questions. I think one of the question obviously in everyone's mind is around the idea of unlocking value and understanding it's a very fluid process at this point, but I was wondering, Fred, if maybe you could just take a step back and help us understand the motivation around the timing to have the management team evaluate the strategic plan at this point. Fredric N. Eshelman Well, as I indicated and as we indicated in our press release, our Board and in particular our new board members of which there are three, thought it would be a very good time to have a strategic review not only in interest of the company and shareholders, but also as somewhat of an educational exercise for the new directors. Naturally, while we were doing that and while we were putting together extensive plans and numbers and so forth and so on, it became pretty obvious that, that would be a good time to see, are there other ways that we could unlock value for shareholders given how the stock price has performed. And having said that, that’s about all the comments we can make on that, and I guess I'd have to refer you back to our press release. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs No, that’s fair. I appreciate the additional color. You guys also mentioned, I believe that conversion was lengthening somewhat. I guess could you talk a little bit about what the driver there was, and how are you guys thinking about conversion of backlog going forward? Daniel G. Darazsdi The conversion and backlog actually is quite good. I mean, we came in with a 33 month conversion rate on backlog, that’s in line actually a little bit better than it’s operated on a historic level, and the revenue conversion was quite positive. William J. Sharbaugh Yeah. Bob, I think what you’re referring to, Fred may mention that the sales cycle was lengthening a little bit, conversion is pretty steady. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs Okay, good. Thanks for the clarification. And the last one I have is just on Celtic, you know obviously it’s something that you guys had mentioned should fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, I think the previous expectation of was that it would be neutral to slightly positive clearly a little bit more than that this quarter. Can you maybe just give us a sense of how much visibility you guys have into the earning stream from Celtic? Is it something where you can actually see ahead of a quarter, what the contribution is tracking at intra quarter or is it something you get once every three months? Fredric N. Eshelman This is Fred. It’s not an earning stream, it’s a revaluation of assets which they have to do, and they have a lengthy process that they go through with market research consultants who come up with numbers and then of course those numbers are vetted with a major big for accounting firm to come up with the actual numbers. So that’s how that occurs. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs And I guess, is there any clarity on the expectation around that for the rest of the year? Fredric N. Eshelman Dan? Daniel G. Darazsdi You know, we think at this point, this is a place that’s going to fluctuate in full challenging the (inaudible) .  But we think over the next couple of quarters is like, we to be just slightly positive, and of course that can fluctuate. Robert Jones – Goldman Sachs Great. Thanks for the question. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Todd Van Fleet with First Analysis. Your line is open. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Hi, good morning, guys. I’m just curious as to what your view was with the impact of the softness in vaccine and BioDuro in the quarter in terms of kind of margin impact or EPS impact, if you could articulate that for us would be helpful. Lee E. Babiss Yes. I’ll take that, and good morning. This is Lee E. Babiss. Let me touch on the vaccine area first. Since the end of last year, we’ve seen growing interest amongst the major pharmaceutical companies that are doing vaccine work to outsource more of their lab work. And we believe we're poised to capture that because of not only   the credibility of the technological capabilities we have in outlying facility, but also by the experience the 120 scientists have there having contributed to bringing four vaccines to the market while working at Merck. We believe we have all of the platforms and the technical know-how in place. We primarily focus on prophylactic vaccines and there we have all assays in place in support of vaccines under markets as well as those in clinical trails today. We’re also working with government in support of epidemiological studies, and we’re investing and enhancing our PBMC and biorepository capabilities. The Merck relationship is in year three of a five-year contract and that work is going well. We have signed on an additional large pharma client into three-year deal working at molecular efficacy by PCR as well as SBA testing. We have another large pharma client authorization that we plan to close this week and it’s up the same magnitude of the previous one that I just described. We have either completed or are doing pilot studies with all of the major pharmaceutical companies in the vaccine space as well as the midsize biotech’s as well. All of the reports that we’re getting from those are leading to again, small term contracts as well as very positive feedback in terms of our abilities relative to the competition. We continue to expand our capabilities in terms of platform testing, enhancing our biorepository   capabilities and also poising ourselves to capture the emerging therapeutic vaccine R&D market. From a network perspective, the network is expanding very nicely. Bill talked about our (inaudible) capabilities during vaccine work and the large contract we have there and that’s now expanding into a GMP area as well. So overall, we feel very good about the vaccine work as a growth drive that’s starting in Q3 of this year. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. That sounds great. I guess I’m curious as well as to the performance because you had mentioned both the vaccine and the BioDuro business kind of hitting gross margin in the quarter. I would guess just based on the results that the short fall relative to your expectations in those two business segments was more on the expense side of the equation or the margin performance for that business rather than the revenue, although it sounds like though maybe that’s not entirely accurate and the way you’re talking about or ramp up or the expected ramp up for those businesses in the back half of the year. So the, I guess, what I’m saying as the overall margin performance for the business was below what we expected in the June quarter. You had would mention vaccines and BioDuro’s being of particular areas of softness relative to your expectations, I’m just trying to get to articulate what the shortfall was relative to your expectations? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. Well, let me go ahead and face that. I think the point that we’re trying to make here is, our historical core laboratories are performing very well and meeting the expectations. What you have you know with BioDuro and the vaccine lab are two new businesses for the company. We’re making strategic investments in those businesses. In the bottom line, at this point in time you know we don’t have as much revenue growth to offset the investments that we’re making hence our margins are little bit lower than we want them to be. But what you here is a lot of confidence based on conversations with client and contracts that we’ve been in discussions with or closing over the course of this year and into the second half of the year to give us confidence that those two business units within our lab segment are going to improve thereby bringing up the entire segment. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. Fredric N. Eshelman This is, Fred. I think you know folks are trying to get us to quantitate this somehow in this quarter, since we called this as being a negative impact so, do you have an estimate of what the impact might have been between vaccines and BioDuro. Daniel G. Darazsdi So, we haven’t really both forward direct impact on the margins from those specific businesses. I think the, one thing that we have really tried to highlight is that on a go forward basis in the third quarter and fourth quarter we’re expecting revenue growth to be strong from both of them in addition to some other parts of the prior business we’re expecting [bio way] to before be positive and our central lab to deliver strong. I would say just in general, with out the drag from those two businesses we would be approaching our 20% operating margin target for the segment. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. If I could just ask one follow on then related to that. So thinking about the incremental margin for the new revenue that you expect to start moving through those businesses. I think it’s probably fair to say that it’s substantially above the corporate average overall, would it be fair to say that the incremental margin attached to the incremental revenue flowing to those businesses is north of say 40% or so. Fredric N. Eshelman Are you talking about on the gross basis or operating… Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Operating… William J. Sharbaugh I’m not sure you can draw that conclusion. I think the, probably what you are looking to is you know our labs in general have stronger variable contribution when you start to get revenue growth, because of the overhead that’s already absorbed. So, yes as you get revenue growth it definitely gross margins in those lab businesses and lab businesses in general to try to break it up specific to the labs going to do that, but I think the insight of what I gave relative to what the quarter, that the quarter would have approached our targeted 20% with out that drug should provide pretty good insight. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. Dan just quickly, what’s your share count you’re assuming for the year, full year? Daniel G. Darazsdi Share count for the year is 117 for the full year average for the diluted shares. Todd Van Fleet – First Analysis Corp. Okay. Thanks. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell with R.W. Baird. Your line is open. Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co. Thanks. Most of mine have been covered. Just a quick one recently one of the privately held bioanalytical competitors received some fairly serous FDA warnings and it’s in a process of working with the clients over the last five years to retest or those clients will need to retest all bioanalytical studies. I’m curious if things like this can be a positive short term drag for you in terms of your bioanalytical sales activity and how you respond to situations like this when a tremendous amount of rework needs to be done in this market place in a short period of time. Thanks. William W. Richardson Eric this is, Bill. It’s the opposite effect here at PPD, it’s not a drag our quality record in our bioanalytical lab is stellar. We have the FDA in there. I think last quarter and certainly had them in there last year. So, I think one of the value propositions for PPD is our quality record. So, we don’t see that as a drag or a potential problem Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co. Actually maybe I didn’t state the question well. I actually was asking the client, the pharma are going to have to rework all of these bioanalytical studies that were done at that Houston facility for your competitor since 2005, and my question is whether that could actually drive a (inaudible) unexpected one time work and how you would attack that if it is an opportunity? William J. Sharbaugh Well, I don’t know the specifics of that particular client and what they need to reset. I can tell you that our doors are open if they want to bring our way. Fredric N. Eshelman Well, I think that if it’s a very quick push through, obviously it depends on whether or not those particular assay is validated or whether or not we have to start from scratch. But we had a similar situation some years ago that did in fact result in an up tick in our business. Eric Coldwell – Robert W. Baird & Co. Thanks, Fred. I was thinking the DNDS situation might be a good analogy at present for what could happen here, but I’ll take it offline. Thanks very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of James Kumpel with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is now open. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Good morning. I want to first start out with cash flows and see if you’re comfortable that second half operating cash flows and free cash flows will be need for improvements over the first half. Daniel G. Darazsdi Hey, James its, Dan. Let me just provide some additional details around cash. Cash from operations was $18 million lower than you know previously historically kind of delivered, and we had a significant tax payment in the quarter and just to kind of calibrate that a little bit for you, US and foreign tax was paid for around $30.6 million in Q2 and to give you some past sides around that first quarter was around $2.4 million and second quarter was tense to be a higher cash tax payment quarter was about $16.1 million. So that you know really it needs to be taken into consideration plus you know we have a bit of an up tick in DSOs, but I think as you hopefully appreciate you know we are really running a best-in-class and I think DSO delivery we’ve had significant improvement in that, its going to move around from time-to-time, but I think our DSOs are operating you know sub 30s and with the 26 DSO on the second quarter year-to-date basis. I think that is still pretty good number, but it did stress the cash flow for the current quarter a little bit expecting to get back on track nicely in 3Q and 4Q. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets And can you give us sort of some parameters for what you’re looking at on free cash flow this year? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well, we’re not just in the guidance that was previously issued. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets And I guess with regard to guidance you know originally was you guys looking kind of break-even for Celtic so what it make sense to adjust the quarterly going forward basis for the expected contributions or are you going to kind of stick (inaudible) that just want various moving parts. Daniel G. Darazsdi Well, you know clearly in the second quarter we had a benefit from Celtic, but on a go forward basis 3Q and 4Q we’re expecting it to just being normally positive and you know that can fluctuate as evidenced in the second quarter, but we’re not expecting that at this time. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Okay. With regard to the strategic which are clearly helping in terms of new authorizations, can you help us understand whether are not you know some of the potential clients are asking you for upfront investments in new capabilities and staff that some of your competitors can ask to do for particular strategic deal? William J. Sharbaugh Yeah, I’ll go ahead and take that one. You know the bottom line here for PPD is you know we’re very diligent in terms of making decisions about augmenting staff. It needs to be done in contract with the work, and when we sign a strategic partnership that doesn’t unlock (inaudible) of hiring what unlocks a   (inaudible) of hiring is a concrete authorization from that strategic partnership, so we are doing it in concert with our new business. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Okay. And just finally Fred, if you can comment a little bit as to whether or not you’re seeing out in the marketplace any type of virtual outsourcing deals maybe aligned   earlier this year that foresee a significant uptick in outsourcing levels? Fredric N. Eshelman Are you referring to FSP type deals or…? James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets No, I am thinking more like with regard to Align or maybe the level of outsourcing as a percentage of R&D is going to pick up meaningfully somewhere they should historically been. Fredric N. Eshelman I think it varies client by client as you well know some clients are making big cuts primarily around mergers. Other clients are up ticking just a little bit. So on balance I think we generally model some very little overall increase in R&D for Pharma higher for biotech. I think we are seeing more enquiries around innovated ways to outsource both including taking over functions or gradually win-win down capability within and picking it up without. There is some FSP activity. So it’s all over the board but there is a lot of noise in the good sense as I think you know from the huge up-tick in RFPs. James Kumpel – BB&T Capital Markets Okay. Thank you very much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Douglas Tsao with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital Hi, good morning. Just Dan, you highlighted the target operating margin for the last segment is around 20%. I was just curious when you think about where you are today given the business flows that you’ve seen and some of the investments you have to make. What’s your sort of internal planning in terms to get back to that level? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well Doug, you know I think you’d really have to look lab by lab but I think you know when I step back and look at the lab performance it’s going to come from number of areas Lee touched on some but look, I think we’re going to have strong revenue growth and Bill has articulated I think very clearly the great opportunity we have with the Bioway lab and the fact that that new capacity is coming on line, on schedule, DCL lab is working to have some nice growth. Our core labs are looking to improve from a revenue delivery viewpoint and of course, that brings with it some scale advantage as revenue comes online. and I think we do a pretty good job of driving productivity. So we’re looking to get some revenue ramp in the labs, and that’s going to come with increased operational efficiency and operating margin delivery and then I think we talked very clearly expectations for vaccine and biologics center of excellence and BioDuro come up. So I think that’s how the whole model works. Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital And then when you look at the margin in the clinical services business, to what extent, has the company been forced to carry some additional headcount in order to meet the requirement of some of the strategic partnerships? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well, to my former comment, let me back it up with some evidence. If you look at our headcount at the end of Q2, 2010 was 10,902, I just told you that at the end of this quarter, a year later it’s 11,253, that is 3% year-over-year headcount growth. So as I said, we’re going to hire in concert with the actual authorizations that we win and what we’re looking to do is obviously to grow our headcount appropriately to service those clients, but if we can keep our SG&A to support that growth below our growth rate, then we’re in good position. So we’re doing it prudently, carefully, but appropriately. Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital And when I look at that headcount, those headcount numbers look very good relative to the top line growth, the margins in the Clinical Service segments are down from where you were at the end of last year. So I’m just sort of curious as to what you see as the key drivers for getting back to where you are? William J. Sharbaugh Well, our goal is to take that 18.2% we mentioned for clinical development services and get it up to our historical target of 20%. We’re going to do that, the old fashion way, we’re going to watch our cost structure and we’re going to deliver for clients with excellence, we’re going to keep our pricing philosophy here in tact and we think that with a lot of focus on productivity and operational improvements, we can bring those labs or those margins backup to 20% and that’s what we’re aiming to do. Daniel G. Darazsdi Correct. And I mean to Bill’s point look on the clinical development side, I think that business has been performing well, we’re expecting to get revenue growth over the next couple of quarters and that will come up with some SG&A efficiency, I think we’ve demonstrated a good ability to generate and support the revenue growth with really strong SG&A management and you know just as you take a look at the second quarter, recall that we did have a couple of expenses that head into the second quarter of $1.5 million I talked to which we’re going to generate a positive benefit on a go forward basis. But in the quarter that did push SG&A up a little bit. (Inaudible). Douglas Tsao – Barclays Capital Okay great. Thank you very much, Dan. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Sandy Draper – Raymond James Thanks very much. This question relates to some of the earlier ones around the Celtic and I know you guys don’t tend to change guidance a lot or tweak a lot. I’m just curious how you thought about it, I think at the beginning of the year you weren’t really factoring in any material contributions from Celtic you obviously got it about, looks like about $0.06 this quarter. Is that just sort of a number you are willing to absorb, is that number sort of offset the weaker performance of BioDuro and Vaccines sort of how did you think about that in terms of the full year numbers. And then the second question would be I know you’re not anywhere close to talking about 2012, but when we think about the lower margins in the first half of this year to get your guidance you’ve got to have significantly better margins in the second half of the year. Is there anything in the first half of the year that would need to repeat itself and that sort of the year-over-year comps you need to factor that in or will as you improve the business in the second half of the year should that sort to be opened to be equal a new water mark for speaking about where you’re entering in 2012. Thanks. Daniel G. Darazsdi Hi, Sandy it’s, Dan. While doing that question we’ll share have a couple of points. I think the first part around Celtic and how we think about that and if you go back and look and we don’t talk the guidance unless we’re changing, we haven’t changed it. So, I would say in the Celtic assumption we said our earlier expectations would be pretty nominal and then maybe generate some benefit in the fourth quarter. As we look at it now, we did obviously generate some additional benefits in the second quarter, but we’re expecting it to be pretty nominal in 3Q and 4Q. So and fair it would isolate that in the second quarter I’d say we had positive contribution from Celtic and we had some challenges that weren’t not expected in the labs specifically in Vaccine and BioDuro, and we always puts and takes and that’s a little bit of what happened in the second quarter. So going forward we’re expecting to improve relative to the labs delivery, we’re not expecting to have that kind of a repeat from Celtic on a go forward basis. And at this time, we’re not talking about 2012 in terms of guidance or outlook. So probably not comment on that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Steve Unger with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Hi, good morning. Just a follow-up question on headcount. You did mentioned that the headcount is up over 3% year-over-year, your backlog is up 14% year-over-year and the duration I believe you mentioned is shortening a little bit. Is there a metric that is it is a capacity utilization or some sort of hiring, sort of bullish that we should be expecting in the future I am curious as to why the headcount growth lag so much to backlog growth? Daniel G. Darazsdi Well I think it’s good management on our part look we mentioned it before but Dan I sit down for every single SG&A add or replacement in the company and you know that’s run by Fred. We are being very careful there. We are certainly not turning off the stick it in terms of operational revenue generating hiring. So we are doing that in concert with the business as appropriate remember there is a lag between an authorization and ultimately the – towards the peak run rate of that contract. So this is a case of modulating your hiring to being concert with when you need it. I think that we are doing a good job and we are in the sweet spot right now doing what we do well here at PPD. William J. Sharbaugh Yeah, let me just add to that as well obviously on the clinical side especially as it relates to margins its all about hiring just in time and training just in time we overshoot we got a problem with G&A undershoot you can’t perform. Generally speaking cancellations are bad news however if you do have a higher the normal cancellation remember that we didn’t have capability that pulls half of those projects and is available for other projects which can also make the numbers look a little bit funny for you know a short period of time and as to your question about is there a metric, we look at certainly, we look at illustration across every single part of our business and we know where it needs to be within the particular segments. So that absolutely is a metric that we follow closely. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Is that utilization at the moment optimized I mean are you feeling that you are getting the maximum utilization that you would prefer at the moment. William J. Sharbaugh Well no because I generally like to set that number to 120%. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Okay. Got you. Just a follow up on that question, as far as direct costs are concerned your direct cost went up $10 million sequentially in the quarter, whereas the headcount was up roughly about 100, is there something else that’s going in the direct cost that we should be thinking about that outside of headcount that is ramping in the business? Daniel G. Darazsdi It is Dan. I will take that Steve, I think the – for your question most help me better understand exactly what you’re trying to get out with your question. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Sequentially your direct cost went up $10 million but headcount was only up 100 people I’m assuming you’re not paying those people during the quarter? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. So, those – there is two things one is utilization which is effective but the other one is recall that April 1 is annual merit cycle increase. So, those – that merit cycle hits April 1 and so you have a full quarter of solid increase. I think that helps kind of bridge that for you and thus far I want to clarify the question. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Great. Okay and then is the bulk of the incremental investment in BioDuro is that behind us, is – are you going to continue to ramp investment going forward to the reminder of this year in BioDuro? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah, second take that, no I think the bulk of the investment in BioDuro has been completed and as you know the primary investments went into enhancing some of their technological capabilities as well as two big investments that we’ve made in the regeneration space one with TBL a small biotech company was whom we formed a joint-venture to provide clients with best in class monoclonal antibody therapeutics and that’s preceding well. And then the other is a – an investment we’ve made in a company called [XCAM] which has also regeneration platform for small molecules based on DNA based chemistry. So, both of those investments are in place and now we’re trying to realize the reap the benefit from those investments. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Got you. And then finally Dan and as far as the – the tax rate is concerned for the back half of the year could you remind us what the guidance is? Daniel G. Darazsdi We’re expecting the – the tax rate to get back to within our guidance range and the full year tax rate for the 2011 initial guidance was 29% to 31%. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets 29 to 31, great. Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. and we expect to operate during the back half of the year. Stephen Unger – Lazard Capital Markets Great job guys. Thanks. Daniel G. Darazsdi Yes. Operator Your last question comes from the line of David Windley with Jefferies & Co. Your line is now open. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. Hi, thanks for taking the questions. On strategic partnerships, I’m looking at your comments about, I think you said more than 50% of your revenue coming from the strategic partnerships, but your client concentration is relatively stable sequentially. I was hoping you could just expand a little bit on perhaps the number of those the diversity of the types of deal they are, i.e., project driven versus FSP driven and how you are I guess able to see more stability in your backlog conversion in light of the contribution in these strategic partnerships? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. Dave, what I mentioned was second quarter net revenue in growth authorizations that a little over half way from our strategic partners. Remember, we obviously segment our customer base, so when we talk about strategic partners, we have sort of some different tiers there. But the bottom line is I think what we suggest it would play out is playing now. We’re seeing good volume from these partnerships as they mature, as they reach their run rates, and you know as Fred said, that’s helping our hit rates obviously a little bit. And if you even look at our labs, we’re seeing some spill over into the labs as well. So when you look at top clients in the labs and compare them to clinical development, you see a lot of the same companies, which we think is a good thing. Our view is that, over time we hope that those partnerships are going to mature to where we hope they can go, and when you’re just one of a couple of providers with these big pharma companies, there’s a lot of potential. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. Thank you for that. Corollary, I suppose in the lab business, I think because of some strategic partnerships maybe not fully from those, you seem to have pretty solid line of sight to some specific revenue sources that were going to contribute to your back half ramp. And it sounds like one has begun in July. I wondered if the others of those are also holding pretty firm to your expected start dates on things like central lab, the Richmond biolab et cetera? Daniel G. Darazsdi Yeah. I think we talked to it, that we’re having all the right discussion with all the right players. There is a couple of contracts that are in the later phases stages of negotiation and hopefully award. So we feel really good about the second half of the year. And as we said, we’re going to obviously grow revenue and improve the margins on our last segment. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. If I could just end, couple for Fred. Fred, I’m wondering if you can comment to the value enhancing option review, do you expect that that review will result in an action without saying what that action would be, will there be an action or could it be no action? Fredric N. Eshelman I can’t really comment beyond what was in the press release and what I said earlier today at this time. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. Okay. And then also at the Board level, can you comment on what the key qualities you are looking for in the CEO search, it sounds like you’ve nailed it down, you’re moving forward with some candidates. I’m hearing some things about those candidates that they are kind of financially oriented people. And so I’m curious about what qualities you would define is the most important? Fredric N. Eshelman Well, when we started out, we had pretty much agreed with the Board and the search committee that they were somewhere around ten attributes that we would like to see and obviously you have to sort of use and no one is going to score a 100% in every category. and so you give and take a little bit, but financial acumen, I rate very high on my list, because in my view whoever is running the place has got to understand the numbers, be ahead of the numbers and be able to immerse themselves in those at all times. I think it’s clear whoever comes in needs to know healthcare whether it’s this specific business or not is another matter, but certainly know something about healthcare pharma biotech and so forth, we need somebody who is generally speaking a Type A plus personality who is after at everyday, because this business will get away from you if you’re not careful and on and on and on. So we’ve got these attributes lined up, we know what they are and that’s how we are screening folks. David Windley – Jefferies & Co. That’s fantastic. Thank you, Fred. Operator This concludes the Q&A portion of today’s call. I’ll turn it back for closing remarks. Fredric N. Eshelman Okay. This is Fred. Thank you all very much for being on the call. Our view is that the business is doing very well, it’s coming along as planned. The laboratory weaknesses we have outlined specifically the rest of the historical labs are performing well in terms of margin and so forth. So we know the job ahead of us, we know what we have to do, and as usual at PPDs and execution story. So again, thank you very much and we look forward to talking with you soon. Good bye.

Welcome to the QUALCOMM’s Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded April 19, 2017. The playback number for today’s call is 855-859-2056. International callers please dial 404-537-3406. The playback reservation number is 95200877. I would now like to turn the call over to John Sinnott, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sinnott, please go ahead. John Sinnott Thank you, everyone and good afternoon. Today’s call will include prepared remarks by Steve Mollenkopf, Derek Aberle and George Davis. In addition, Cristiano Amon and Don Rosenberg will join the question-and-answer session. You can access our earnings release and a slide presentation that accompany this call on our investor relations website. This call is also being webcast on qualcomm.com, and a replay will be available on our website later today. During the call today, we will use non-GAAP financial measures, as defined in Regulation G. And you can find the related reconciliations to GAAP on our website. We will also make forward-looking statements, including projections and estimates of future events, business, or industry trends, or our business or financial results. Actual events or results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Please refer to our SEC filings, including our most recent 10-Q, which contain important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. And now, the comments from QUALCOMM’s Chief Executive Officer, Steve Mollenkopf. Steve Mollenkopf Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results this quarter. Fiscal second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.14 above the midpoint of our prior guidance range, reflecting a continued focus on operational performance across the businesses. Our semiconductor business continues to benefit from both a strong product roadmap, perhaps the strongest in our Company’s history as well as industry trends that bode well for our ability to further grow the semiconductor business outside of handsets. Automotive, networking and IoT were particularly strong this quarter. Several of these product lines became part of QUALCOMM largely through M&A and will be further strengthened with the upcoming addition of NXP. Our QCT business continues to deliver a broad set of industry leading products, positioning us well for the opportunities ahead. We delivered strong topline results this quarter and operating margins were ahead of expectations. Our partners are already announcing new premium tier devices based on our new Snapdragon 835 mobile platform including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, Sony Xperia XZ premium and the Xiaomi Mi 6. Additionally, the 835 is extending to new categories beyond smartphones such as the ODR or ODG AR smart glasses announced at CES. Our high and mid-tier Snapdragon 600 and 400 platform offerings continued to see high adoption, particularly in China with 200 plus devices and design in the 600-tier and 190 plus devices and design in the 400-tier worldwide. In March, we announced our 205 mobile platforms designed to bring 4G LTE connectivity and 4G services for entry level feature phones and we expect OEM devices to be announced starting this quarter. The increasing number of gigabit LTE operator launches around the world this year validates our early investment and enabling gigabit speeds across 4G networks and our modem roadmap continues to be more than a generation ahead of the competition. Telstra launched the world's first gigabit LTE network and device earlier this year and all four major U.S. carriers have announced plans to launch gigabit LTE in 2017. Our Snapdragon X16 gigabit LTE modem was featured in February in a live demo of the Sony Xperia XZ premium and more recently versions of the Samsung Galaxy S8 including in North America, China and Japan also featured gigabit LTE based on the Snapdragon 835. We continue to lead the industry to 5G through our 3GPP leadership, ongoing prototype efforts, announcements of meaningful 5G new radio trials as well as our industry first X50 5G modem. In February, we demonstrated the first 3GPP based 5G new radio connection and announced the extension of our Snapdragon X50 family of 5G modems to include support for the global 5G NR standard across the millimeter wave and sub-6 gigahertz frequency bands, along with backwards compatibility for 2G, 3G, 4G, including gigabit LTE. We expect commercial products to be available to support the first large scale 5G NR trials and commercial network launches starting in 2019. Turning to QTL, the licensing business had a strong quarter. Total reported device sales were a record driven by strong 3G/4G unit shipments and higher than expected ASPs. QTL results were in line with expectations as the stronger market and improved licensing in China offset the impact of a new dispute with a licensee. During the quarter, we returned approximately $1.1 billion to stockholders through dividends and stock repurchases. We also announced a 7.5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend now at $2.28 per share annually reflecting our confidence in the strength of our ongoing cash flows and future earnings growth. During the quarter, we closed on our joint venture with TDK, which is an important strategic milestone to grow our portfolio of RF front-end products and technologies. I am very pleased that we now have all the critical components to build industry-leading RF modules across tiers and to compete in the total RF front-end service available market. We also received U.S. regulatory clearance for our pending acquisition of NXP. We remain on track to close the transaction this calendar year and integration planning continues across both companies. Looking ahead, the adoption of mobile technologies and mobile computing is accelerating around the world. Our broad and growing set of technologies and innovations are fundamental to mobile communications and are enabling entirely new business models and ecosystems. This trend will continue for years to come as advanced 4G, 5G and other mobile technologies expand their footprint into new industries. Looking across the growing set of new industries embracing mobile technologies, we have more opportunities ahead of us than it any time in the Company's history. Against this backdrop, we have had a series of legal and regulatory challenges that have unfortunately overshadowed otherwise strong operating performance at QUALCOMM. We have successfully navigated challenges like this in the past and we have confidence in the sustainability of our licensing business. But we know these periods can generate added volatility in near-term results and require open and regular dialogue with our investors, which is something we are fully committed to providing. While we work to conclude the right deals that will deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Most importantly, we will remain focused on investing to lead innovation in key mobile and related technologies as that has always been the core of what's placed us in this unique and unmatched leadership position. While Derek will provide more details on the recent legal challenges, we have taken several specific steps to address the KFTC and FTC matters during the last quarter. And last week, we filed our answer and counterclaims in the Apple litigation here in Southern California. It is important to remember that ultimately this is about a contract dispute and business negotiation and we will work to reach the right resolution for our shareholders as we have done so often throughout our history. Further, the Company will continue to focus on developing and delivering the best products to our customers including Apple consistent with our track record to-date. We are optimistic about the speed of innovation in the modem and RF areas with technologies such as gigabit LTE, 5G NR, multimode and millimeter wave becoming increasingly important. Considering the strength of both our product roadmap in R&D investments, we expect to continue to be an important supplier to Apple now and into the future. As we continue towards the closing of our pending acquisition of NXP later this year, I thought it would be good to review some of the larger growth opportunities that will be enabled by our unique collection of technologies, sales channels and scale for the interconnected world. First, we will lead in 5G. 5G is the interconnecting fabric for the connected world and will drive not only an upgrade cycle in mobile, but will also enable new industries to take advantage of the mobile ecosystem. We will continue to work closely with global infrastructure vendors and operators on 5G NR trials to drive the mobile ecosystem toward validation and timely commercialization of 5G NR. To-date, we have announced 5G NR trials with SKT and Ericsson in Korea, AT&T and Ericsson in the United States, ZTE and China Mobile in China, Telstra and Ericsson in Australia, and Vodafone and Ericsson in Europe. The interoperability testing and trials are planned to launch in the second half of 2017. Second, we will grow our content in the device with our expanding RF front-end capabilities. We have taken a big step forward in closing the RF360 JV to transform this business and we also have already started delivering our first gallium arsenide PAs. As we move to 5G, the device will become more complex from an RF point of view as massive MIMO and multi-element arrays exist on many devices and our unique ability to provide solutions across the baseband and RF will become even more important to our customers. Third, automotive will continue to be a source of growth and we are winning more than just the telematics systems. Our automotive solutions, including cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and infotainment SoCs have been adopted by every major global automaker. Our Snapdragon, automotive infotainment platforms have won new designs at 12 of the top 25 global automaker brands. This strong design pipeline shows the strength of our computing solutions in the automotive market and represents an opportunity to sell multiple Snapdragons per car. With the addition of NXP, the opportunity to grow content in the car increases dramatically and we will be uniquely positioned for ADAS and autonomous driving, a large multi-decade mega trend that is just starting. You will be hearing more from us on this important topic in the future. Fourth, IoT will drive meaningful growth across a broad range of opportunities. Success in these opportunities will be defined by the ability to combined connectivity, computing and security along with a broad channel to serve not only industrial verticals, but a long tail of customers to deliver high complexity products and platforms that are easy for our customers to use and integrate. Here again the acquisition of NXP will uniquely position us with IoT systems solutions and channels and builds on the success we are seeing in the business today. Fifth, we have an opportunity to disrupt the existing suppliers of the PC and the datacenter. Our Snapdragon 835 is expanding into Mobile PC designs running Windows 10, which are scheduled to launch in the fourth calendar quarter this year. In the data center, we announced the collaboration with Microsoft and demonstrated Windows Server Running on our 10 nanometer Qualcomm Centriq processors, the first 10 nanometer server processors in the industry. To close, we are very focused on resolving the challenges to our licensing business and business model and we are confident we will be able to successfully navigate through this environment. At the same time, this is an extremely exciting and transformative time for our Company as the technologies and products are well positioned to expand into a growing set of opportunities and will be further enhanced with the completion of our pending acquisition of NXP. I would now like to turn the call over to Derek. Derek Aberle Thank you, Steve and good afternoon, everyone. As Steve noted, QTL had a strong fiscal second quarter with record total reported device sales of approximately $82.6 billion, up approximately 18% year-over-year and just above the high-end of our prior guidance range. The record TRDS for the quarter reflects significantly increased year-over-year unit reporting from recent China licensing progress as well as ASP strength particularly in China and typical seasonal strength in North America. We estimate that reported 3G/4G device shipments were approximately 400 million units within ASP of approximately $207 at the midpoints. Global 3G/4G handset ASPs are tracking consistent with our prior expectations of low single-digit percentage declines year-over-year. We also continue to see healthy growth in global 3G/4G device shipments. For calendar year 2016, we have increased our estimate of global 3G/4G device shipments to reflect even stronger December quarter shipments than we previously expected led by stronger sales in China. We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion 3G/4G devices were shipped in 2016, up approximately 10% year-over-year. For calendar 2017, we are reaffirming our estimated global 3G/4G device shipments of 1.75 billion to 1.85 billion devices, up approximately 6% year-over-year at the midpoint. We believe that some of the December quarter shipments strength in China resulted in a modest build-up of inventory there, which we expect will be sold through in the first half of calendar 2017. We estimate that this will push some of the expected first half calendar 2017 shipments into the second half of the calendar year and thus into QTL’s fiscal 2018 instead of fiscal 2017. The fiscal second quarter revenue and operating profit results for QTL, which were largely in line with our prior guidance were negatively impacted by a dispute with one of our licensees. This dispute resulted in the licensee underpaying royalties of more than $150 million for sales during the December quarter. We are working to resolve this dispute, but we expect the licensee, which is not one of the suppliers of iPhones to Apple to continue to under report its royalties until the dispute is resolved and therefore have factored that into our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Last week, we announced that an arbitration panel awarded BlackBerry and $850 million refund of royalties that have previously paid to QUALCOMM for past sales. The dispute related to whether our voluntary per unit running royalty cap program applied to BlackBerry’s non-refundable prepayments of royalties for a license to sell a specified number of handsets from 2010 through the end of 2015. We strongly disagree with the ruling, but it is binding and not appealable. It is worth noting that this was a specific contract provision that was unique to BlackBerry’s agreement, so this outcome has no impact on agreements with any other licensee. The contract provision also does not apply to BlackBerry sales after 2015. It is also important to note that even after this refund, BlackBerry paid royalties for all devices it sold during the 2010 to 2015 time period equal to the per unit amount specified in our voluntary per unit running royalty program. We continue to actively pursue resolutions and protect the established value of our patented technologies in the regulatory and other legal matters in which we are involved. We have plans for addressing each of these proceedings and are confident that the QTL business will remain a strong cash flow contributor to the Company for many years to come. Regarding the KFTC, we have begun the formal legal process for both an appeal and a stay of the decision pending the outcome of the appeal, as the ruling is clearly inconsistent with the facts and the law reflects a flawed process and represents a violation of due process rights owed American companies under the Korea, U.S. pre-trade agreement. We expect to have a decision on our application for a stay in the coming months. As to the U.S. FTC investigation, we have filed a motion to dismiss the FTC’s compliant consistent with our ongoing view that the complaint which was filed just days before the change in administration in over a strong objection by the commissioner who is now the acting chair of the FTC fails to state a plausible antitrust claim and offers no facts or economic theory supporting the claim of competitive harm. As to the Taiwan investigation, we are continuing to cooperate with the TFTC as we work towards finding the resolution of this matter. While certain investigations in Europe remain pending. These investigations do not involve QUALCOMM's licensing business or practices. Finally, as Steve mentioned, we have now formally responded to the complaint filed by Apple here in Southern California. Apple’s complaint includes numerous misstatements and mischaracterizations of our agreements, negotiations and contributions to the industry. I urge you to read our answer which clearly describes in detail the facts and corrects these misstatements and mischaracterizations as well as details of the value of the fundamental technologies we have invented, contributed and shared with the industry through our licensing program. We have a strong track record of establishing and defending the value of our technologies that have played an important role in enabling the entire mobile ecosystem, including the incredible smartphone experience. We have freely negotiated and entered into more than 300 license agreements over many years, including with the largest and most sophisticated companies in our industry. The offers we have made to Apple for a direct license to QUALCOMM cellular standard essential patents are consistent with the value of our patent technologies established by these more than 300 arm’s length license agreements and are fully compliant with QUALCOMM's FRAND commitments. It is unfortunate that Apple has rejected these fair and reasonable offers. Also our license agreements with Apple suppliers remain valid long-term agreements many of which were negotiated and entered into before Apple sold the first iPhone. Despite Apple's claims against QUALCOMM, Apple suppliers remain contractually obligated to pay royalties to QUALCOMM under their license agreements with us, including for sales of iPhones to Apple. In our fiscal second quarter, Apple interfered with the license agreements between QUALCOMM and the Apple suppliers by actively inducing them to underpay the royalties they owed to QUALCOMM for sales during the December quarter. Apple withheld payment to their suppliers for sales in the December quarter in an amount equal to what Apple claims QUALCOMM owes to Apple under a separate cooperation agreement between the companies. This was consistent with what Apple said it would do in the complaint it filed in San Diego prior to our last earnings call. Apple suppliers then underpaid royalties to QUALCOMM in the same amount. In the aggregate, this amount is approximately $1 billion. Most of Apple suppliers have already reported the royalties they owe to QUALCOMM for sales to Apple during the March quarter and they are obligated to pay the full amount of those royalties to us. While would expect Apple suppliers to pay the royalties they owe us under their license agreements, it is possible that Apple will continue to interfere with the Apple suppliers license agreements leading those suppliers to breach their contract with QUALCOMM by underpaying some or all of what they owe us. We expect to have more visibility into this in the coming weeks. Given this uncertainty, our fiscal third quarter guidance assumes a range of possible payments from Apple, from the Apple suppliers, but does not reflect a scenario that Apple suppliers pay nothing to us for March quarter sales. Turning to our data center business, as Steve mentioned, we recently announced the collaboration with Microsoft to accelerate next-generation cloud services on our 10 nanometer Centriq 2400 platform, which will span multiple future generations of hardware, software and systems. We also showcased our first public demonstration of Windows Server on ARM running on our processors and contributed a Qualcomm Centriq Open Compute Motherboard to the OCP community. We remain on track for commercial shipments of our server processors by the end of the calendar year and we continue to receive good feedback from our customers. That concludes my comments, and I will now turn the call over to George. George Davis Thank you, Derek, and good afternoon, everyone. Our fiscal second quarter was another solid quarter with non-GAAP revenues of $6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.34, up 13% sequentially. We exceeded the midpoint of our non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.14. Better than expected performance at QCT accounted for approximately $0.05 of the upside on solid MSM demand and strong performance across auto, networking and IoT. The balance of the performance came from better than expected investment portfolio gains and a lower estimated annual tax rate. QTL was in line with expectations for the quarter despite the impact of a licensee dispute join the positive effect of licensing progress in China, strong 3G, 4G demand and a focus on costs. In QCT, MSM chip shipments were 179 million, modestly above the midpoint of our prior guidance. QCT revenues were $3.7 billion and implied revenue per MSM was up sequentially on stronger product mix consistent with our expectations. QCT operating margin was 13% above the high-end of our prior expectations, reflecting higher gross margins in mobile and better than expected operating results in auto, networking and IoT. As Steve mentioned, we were pleased to close the RF360 joint venture in February. We are consolidating the results of the JV on a one-month lag basis and it added approximately 75 million in revenue in the quarter on one-month of activity. QTL fiscal second quarter revenues were $2.2 billion in line with expectations. Total reported device sales were a record and exceeded our prior guidance range on strong ASPs offset by an estimated underpayment of more than 150 million related to a dispute with a licensee. As Derek explained, Apple suppliers reported royalties in the fiscal second quarter for sales activity in the December quarter withheld approximately $1 billion from their payments. This amount is equal to the amount that Apple claims QUALCOMM owes it under a separate cooperation agreement between QUALCOMM and Apple. It is worth noting that fiscal second quarter royalties revenues were not impacted by the underpayment because the suppliers reported the full royalties for the term of their agreement and acknowledge they were due, but underpaid by the same amount that QUALCOMM is withholding from Apple under the cooperation agreement. This is consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. GAAP results for our fiscal second quarter reflect a $974 million reduction of revenues associated with the BlackBerry arbitration award including estimated interest in attorney's fees. This reduced fiscal second quarter GAAP EPS by approximately $0.48 per share. Non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses increased approximately 7% sequentially including the RF360 JV, which was not in our original guidance. Absence of JV, we would have been at the low end of our prior 6% to 8% guidance range. Our non-GAAP tax rate during the fiscal second quarter was 15%. We now estimate that our fiscal 2027 non-GAAP tax rate will be approximately 17% down from our prior estimate of 18% on changes in business mix. We returned approximately $1.1 billion to stockholders in the quarter including $782 million of dividends paid and $283 million in stock repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of $29 billion. The balance sheet this quarter merits some additional commentary to explain the impacts of the licensing related matters as well as the close of RF360 joint venture. First, there were notable adjustments associated with our joint venture with TDK. As a reminder, we are fully consolidating the results of this joint venture as we have the ability to control the business. As a result, our balance sheet reflects the addition of approximately $3.1 billion of the JVs net assets including $1.7 billion of intangible assets in goodwill, $800 million in property, plant and equipment, $260 million in inventory, and $250 million in accounts receivable. Our accounts receivable balance at quarter end also reflects the approximately $1 billion due from Apple suppliers and we continue to carry approximately $1 billion in other current liabilities for the unpaid disputed amounts with respect to the cooperation agreement with Apple, which expired at the end of calendar 2016. Note that these unpaid disputed amounts have been accrued as a reduction to revenues in our P&L over the past few quarters. Also including other current liabilities is $974 million related to the recent BlackBerry award, which we expect to pay in the next few months and $921 million related to the KFTC fine, which was paid shortly after the end of the fiscal second quarter. I will now turn to our fiscal third quarter. Our guidance range for earnings per share is wider than our typical practice primarily due to the uncertainty around whether Apple suppliers will withhold some portion of the royalty payments they are obligated to pay another contracts with us. We have considered a variety of scenarios within the range. Our guidance range does not include the case where no payments are made by Apple suppliers. We will update our guidance if we subsequently learn of any action that would take us materially outside of the announced guidance range. We have also assumed in our guidance that the licensee dispute that Derek mentioned, which arose in the fiscal second quarter remains unresolved in the third quarter and will result in an underpayment relative to what the licensee owes for the third quarter. As a reminder, we are coming off the seasonally strong fiscal second quarter for QTL and our fiscal third quarter typically reflects our low quarter of the year for both revenues and EPS on a normalized basis. We estimate revenues to be in the range of approximately $5.3 billion to $6.1 billion. The year-over-year comparisons for both revenue and EPS are impacted by more than $400 million in catch up licensing revenues recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. We estimate non-GAAP earnings per share in our fiscal third quarter to be in the range of approximately $0.90 to $1.15 per share. We expect fiscal third quarter non-GAAP combined R&D and SG&A expenses will be up approximately 2% to 4% sequentially primarily due to a full quarter impact of the RF360 JV operating expenses and growing spend on litigation matters. In QTL we estimate total reported device sales between $59 billion and $67 billion will be reported by our licensees in the June quarter for shipments they made in the March quarter, down sequentially compared to the seasonally high holiday quarter shipments reflected in fiscal Q2. This includes estimated 3G/4G device sales from Apple's contract manufacturers as well as from the licensee currently in dispute in underpaying. In QCT, we anticipate MSM shipments of approximately 180 million to 200 million units during the June quarter, higher sequentially at the midpoint despite the excess inventory at certain OEMs in China exiting Q2. We expect inventory levels at those OEMs to largely correct within our fiscal third quarter. For the Snapdragon 835 premium tier chipset, we are seeing strong demand exceeding supply. Our growth in operating margin relative to demand in the quarter is being limited by our ability to ramp volumes at 10 nanometer. We expect this to begin to normalize in the fiscal fourth quarter. We expect QCT's fiscal third quarter operating margin to be approximately 13% plus or minus 100 basis points reflecting year-over-year improvement as we continue to gain traction in adjacent opportunities particularly auto, IoT and networking. Our current expectation is that we will be in the capital markets in the second half of fiscal 2017 to fund the remaining portion of our acquisition related needs. We continue to sell longer dated and higher volatility assets in our treasury investment portfolio in anticipation of funding the close of our pending NXP acquisition later in the calendar year. Based on the current market environment, we expect the total of net investment income and interest expense for fiscal 2017 to be flat to down modestly on a non-GAAP basis versus fiscal 2016. The outlook has improved somewhat on the higher yields on short-term assets. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to John. John Sinnott Thank you, George. Operator, we are ready for questions. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rod Hall Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hope you can hear me okay. I just wanted to clarify George what you guys are saying about the withholding, and Derek as well. So our understanding is the rebates, the alleged rebates were withheld for a couple of quarters, and so it sounds like what you're saying is the amount of royalty withheld is catching up for two quarter of rebate withholdings. So I just want to clarify that is in fact the case. And then I also wanted to see if you guys could give us any further color on the guidance range and are you assuming that the royalty withholdings at the midpoint would be equivalent to these rebates that are allegedly not being paid, and then how does the top and bottom end of that EPS range figure into what you're assuming on royalties? Thank you. Derek Aberle Hey, Rod. This is Derek. So if you think about Q2 which we had talked about last quarter in our reporting obviously for this quarter. Basically what happened is, we have a dispute with Apple as to whether we owe them about $1 billion under a cooperation agreement we have. That spans over several quarters of possible payments. What they said in their complaint and what they ended up doing as it relates to the second quarter which are sales through the end of December of 2016 is they effectively withheld payment to their contract manufacturers who then in turn withheld payment to us for royalties that were owed under the contract manufacturers agreements with us in the amount of this disputed cooperation payment, which is about $1 billion. And so that is all reflected in Q2, and as George mentioned because the amounts were reported to us and acknowledged as due, and then we have the cash that we haven't paid to Apple, effectively we took the revenue in Q2 for the amount of the four royalties that were paid net the reserve we had for the payments that are being disputed going back towards Apple. So that's the situation on Q2. On Q3, the guidance as we mentioned includes sort of a variety of possible assumptions on what may play out in terms of what gets paid to us by the contract manufacturers for Q3. I would say the high end of the guidance would be reflective of us getting paid in full, but we've got some other scenarios that are reflected in the range. The agreement itself with Apple which is where we have the dispute of what is owed to them expired at the end of 2016, so has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter which is the guidance we’ve provided for Q3. One last point on this is what is not contemplated in the guidance range is for the contract manufacturers to pay us nothing or very low amount. If that were to happen then we would update you all. George Davis Rod let me add one thing as well, when you look at Q2 you can look to the balance sheet and see the accounts receivable has had a fairly significant pop, not only because we've brought in RF360, but the receivable is up by the - $1 billion of that is the amount owed by the CM’s which are not disputing the fact that they have reported and are obligated to pay under the contract for this amount. So it has shown as a receivable. We are still holding the $1 billion related to the dispute from the prior quarters under current liabilities on our balance sheet. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder Garcha Thanks. Along the same subject I’m afraid and then - on the - just a clarification on your own building was withheld by the contract manufacturers, but something was paid to you, something else was paid to you above that level I assume and it’s not good lead indicator for being paid going forward, am I thinking if I wrong? Steve Mollenkopf No. Yes, go ahead and ask your second question, would jump and then… Kulbinder Garcha And then the other question was really more strategic about how the Apple and QUALCOMM thing plays out. The Foxconn agreement you have is that due to expire anytime soon? I assume it's not you haven't told us about device when it clarify that and it's very rare from what I can remember where you have an agreement with a party and it just stopped paying you. You had a deals expired in the past and you've had disputes perhaps and you have people that want to report on you all day, but is has ever been a scenario where you've had an agreement that last or some period of time and vendor in question just stops paying? George Davis So Kulbin, I'll take the first part of the question, which is what they paid to us, was simply the difference between the full amount owed under the contract minus the disputed amount. So there was some incremental payment that came in, but it was net of that $1 billion that that we described in the prepared remarks. Derek Aberle Yes, just to add to that - this is Derek. The cooperation agreement between QUALCOMM and Apple as I said expired at the end of 2016. So unlike Q2 there really is no basis on which to even argue that there should be a payment of something less than the full amount that the contract manufacturers owed to us. In terms of the Foxconn agreement, it's a long-term agreement. It is not set to expire any time soon. Those are again long-term agreements that are valid in binding and include the contractual obligation to pay the only thing that expired or the direct agreements between QUALCOMM and Apple and those went away at the end of 2016. And to your last point, yes it's been very rare, actually as I sit here can't think of a situation where somebody just simply stop paying us entirely under their agreement where we didn't have a dispute with them as to what they owed or some other thing going on, so that would be rare. Donald Rosenberg This is Don. Just to add one or two things. So to be clear, the excuse that the contract manufacturers used was that Apple wasn't paying them and what Apple was saying was that they are holding back payment to them to match the payments that they claim we owed them from the other agreement to BCPA, no connection to the license agreement between us and our contract manufacturers. So with this totally improper for the contract manufacturers to withhold and we now look at what they're going to do going forward and we say well even we excuse that they used before that is Apple claiming that they were making up for amounts that we didn't pay them doesn't exist anymore. So there doesn't seem to be even an arguable rational reason for anybody to withhold payments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Michael Walkley Great, thank you. Just staying on this topic, just trying to understand maybe the guidance in accounting ramifications, one, you have a licensee that you're dispute with and you didn't recognize $150 million in revenue and I think when you had a dispute with Nokia going back in time when they materially underpaid during that process you have withheld Nokia revenue from your guidance. So if say the contract manufacturers pay some smaller dollar amount that Apple theoretically said they should pay them, do you still recognize a portion of that revenue or do you just take out for altogether like maybe you've done with some of the licensee. Just trying to understand the accounting ramifications if there is any change from your licensee? And then my more fundamental question just on the outlook for QTL, if you can help just walk us on a sequential between seasonality of this the Apple range and then you had this licensee disputed maybe if you could help us just see the sequential decline kind of those different puts and takes that would be helpful? Thank you. Steve Mollenkopf So in terms of taking revenue in the case of a dispute, typically if there's a formal dispute then we would not take revenue until the dispute is resolved and I'll let Derek or Don comment on what constitutes the formal dispute, but certainly entry into arbitration or lawsuit is one case in the past. For the customer in the second quarter, the customer reported fully and underpaid and as not filed a formal dispute and in that case we take the revenue for the amount paid while we're working on collecting the balance owed from the customer. And then do you want to add to that at all? Derek Aberle Yes. I think just the difference Mike - this is Derek - in the two scenarios that the situation we have the current dispute where we didn't take revenue this quarter about 150 million - little more than 150 million. That situation where we did not get paid, so typically if there's a dispute and we're not getting paid, we wouldn't take the portion that's being withheld, which is different than if we are getting paid. On your sequence question, I think really got to remember the Q2 obviously is seasonally high quarter for the year, December quarter obviously typically the high quarter for QTL, so there would normally be a sequential decline going into Q3. I think other factors to consider, I would say we're assuming as I mentioned in my remarks that this dispute will not get resolved with the licensee we mentioned in Q3. So Q2 to Q3 were both assuming an underpayment and then we have a range of possibilities in the assumptions for what we'll get paid from the contract manufacturers supplying to Apple. If I up level it to the market, the market I think is continues to be quite strong. I would say it played out just a little bit differently in terms of what came in, in Q2 versus Q3. If you look at the TRDS range, we were above the high-end slightly of the Q2 TRDS range because of the phenomena of just more sales into China with a little inventory build that we expect will get sold through in Q3, which is therefore a bit of a drag on Q3 TRDS. So I think those are sort of the main drivers to keep in mind. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Long Thank you. Just two quick ones if I could here. First, I just want to clarify the guidance for next quarter. Are you still booking the operating expenses or COGS hit that you were taking for the payment that was going back to Apple previously under that agreement. So if you can clarify if that's still hurting your EPS and reserving against it on the balance sheet and when would that change? And then secondly, the licensee with the $150 million dispute, Derek could you talk a little bit about, I know you can't get into too much of the details, but I just want to understand is this something that maybe is a by-product of other licensees seeing some of these special Apple agreements that were mentioned in their dispute in the BlackBerry arbitration and if not are you getting a lot of phone calls from other OEMs that have seen these other deals that they maybe do not have an understanding they have separate arrangements is that potentially causing any renegotiations? Thank you. Derek Aberle Tim on the - in terms of the accruals that we've taken, those stopped as the contract expires at the end of the calendar year with the last period that that would be reported in - for us was in fiscal Q2. George Davis And just to be - just a reminder, we didn't characterize sort of where those - were accruing on the P&L and that’s I don't want to make it seem like we're validating your description of them. On the second point, I think the way to think about that is the licensee with, which we have a dispute now, those discussions with the licensee I would say have been ongoing for some time and predated the filing in any of the litigation between us and Apple. A lot of times these discussions will go for a period of time before they escalate into a dispute and so that the timing is what it is, but I think it's important to note that the discussions leading up to dispute predated into the BlackBerry or the Apple litigation. And I don't really see a connection to that if you think about the BlackBerry decision. It really is an isolated agreement. And as I mentioned in my remarks even after we make the refund, the amount that BlackBerry paid per unit during that time period was basically consistent with the caps that we have for premium tier devices. So I don't anticipate really any impact from that decision on what other licensees would claim in terms of what it means to their agreements. The Apple situation as we mentioned in a lot of detail in our response, the terms under those agreements I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple submission. So, yes we've had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn't. But I would say that's sort of normal course discussions we would typically have with companies. Steve Mollenkopf Tim, I would add that as I said in my prepared remarks that the disputed amounts under the cooperation agreement were accrued as a reduction to revenues in the P&L. So we can give that level of commentary. Operator Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, first on that the topic of royalties from the contract manufacturers, have you received any payments sense that the original lawsuit was filed and is that part of the reason that you feel comfortable assuming that at least some royalties will be paid and in the June quarter? And then I did want to touch quickly on the NXPI acquisition. Any update on timing of other regulatory body approvals? And can you give us a rough outline yet as to what the financing cost for that portion will be or what the interest rates may look like et cetera if and as that deal closes? Thank you very much. Derek Aberle Jim, this is Derek. On your first question about the contract manufacturers. So yes for Q2 what was reported and owed to us by the contract manufacturers actually exceeded the amount that's in dispute between QUALCOMM and Apple under the cooperation agreement. So we did receive payments under those licenses for the difference as George mentioned between what those companies owed and basically the disputed amount that Apple withheld. And for the Q3, basically we've already received royalty reports from most of the contract manufacturer suppliers to Apple and believe there is a clear and binding payment obligation as it relates to those payments and there is no dispute about other money that is owed from QUALCOMM to Apple. So again if these licensees are operating in accordance with the terms of the agreement they should pay and they should pay the full amount, but again more - a little cautious until we actually get the payment in hand and so that's reflected in the guidance as well as just pointing out that the situation where there's zero payment is not reflected in our range today. Donald Rosenberg This is Don. On the NXP question. So yes, we're pretty much moving as expected as Steve mentioned, we have past the HSR process in the U.S. We should be filing very shortly in Europe and we filed in China already that has not yet been doctored by China, but it's there. And we would anticipate filing in the other jurisdiction very quickly after we’ve completed filing in Europe. So we believe we’re still on track, and we're moving forward. George Davis On the financing front, we expect to be in the market in the second half, we have not put out an estimate yet on the financing costs. No material change in our expected sizing, which was between $10 billion and $12 billion of acquisition debt. But the form of that debt, the term and the tenor will all have an impact on estimated cost and we're not locked down on those yet. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you very much. First, I just wanted to clarify if the payments to Apple under the BCPA were previously reported as comes from revenues in QCT or in QTL. And then the question on the new licensee that was underpaying in the quarter, did they still pay the majority of what they owed you or what’s the $150 million that they underpaid in fact the majority of what they owed you? And then along the same lines, your accounts receivable increased by about $2 billion of which you commented that $1 billion was due to the Apple withholding and then some of that was the TDK joint venture, but in the filing - in the Q, you also say that some of the increase was due to the delayed payments of other licensees. So I was just curious if there are other potential disputes that contributed to that or if that's just purely timing? Derek Aberle Hi, Simona. This is Derek. Maybe I'll take the first two and then George can take the last one. Yes, the amounts that are in dispute between us and Apple as we mentioned last quarter have been fully accounted for and run through the P&L in prior quarters. We did not specify sort of where in the P&L, the various payments were flowing and I think at this time are going to continue on that path. As to the dispute with the licensee, I'm not sure I can characterize majority versus minority, but they did pay a significant amount of royalties to us and didn't withhold - they withheld only a portion of what they owed not the entire payment. George Davis So on the accounts receivable outside of the Apple related $1 billion and the RF360 amounts, what you had was growth in receivables related to QCT, which was just a timing issue or payment relative to when shipments were made. And then on the QTL piece that is really just the timing of payments that are being made on some of the catch up payments where they're spread out over a short period of time just to allow customers to get caught up in addition to fully paying at their new run rate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I know you're making the point that the contract manufacturers are under obligation to pay no matter what they're getting from Apple, but let's be honest they're going to pay you whatever they get from Apple given presumably. So given what you know at this point of Apple's intentions, how can we assess that risks just the fact that you're - you aren't contemplating Apple completely ceasing their payments, so I just think you judge their risk of that happen to be lower, it's just not a scenario that you want to contemplate at this point? And on the revenue recognition, you give us some good color on kind of what constitutes a deferral versus not, but let's just say hypothetically next quarter the contract manufacturers were to pay you 50% of what you believe they owe you for Q3. Would you be able to recognize all that 50% or would you have to defer at that point and send an arbitration and call it zero? How do we think about revenue recognition depending on what's coming in? Donald Rosenberg Stacy, this is Don. Maybe a couple of us who would want to respond to the first question, but yes, to start what you said, I understand it’s a figure of speech, let's be honest. We are being honest and what is a good thing to think about is I disagree with you that it's a foregone conclusion. As I said earlier, Apple's claimed in its case against us is that they would held the specific amount of money in payments to their contract manufacturers because they said it's an offset against money that they claim, we withheld from them improperly in another contract. While we disagree with that claim obviously, the rationale for that no longer applies. As Derek said earlier, that BCPA contract is expired. So they're no more moneys even arguably due from us to them and therefore no basis or rationale to continue withholding from the contract manufacturers. And as Derek also said the contract manufacturers have valid binding contracts with us and our expectation is that they will abide by those obligations and pay us the amount they owe us, which they reported for the quarter. Derek Aberle Stacy, this is Derek. I think on your second question, I think probably the best way to think about it is, we’d have to wait and see all of the circumstances under which the revenue got reported and paid to us to sort of make a final judgment on that, but at a high level I would say we have binding valid agreements with them if they reported half of what they owe and paid that to us. I think the most likely scenario is as long as we're not in litigation with them that we would recognize that revenue within the quarter that is paid. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tavis McCourt Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The $150 million or so license payments that have been withheld in the second quarter, was that contemplated in your second quarter guidance or is that something that happened after the last report? And then, so just to be clear on the contract manufacturers payments for your third quarter guidance, the high end of the guidance would presume they pay in full, but there's no presumption of, obviously, the cooperation agreement payments from you towards Apple with that guidance? Is that correct? George Davis Let me start with your first question which was - we did not contemplate the underpayment in the Q2 guidance. It’s one of the reasons why we made the point that actually if you factor that out it was a strong quarter for QTL, they were able to come in at expectation despite that, and you saw that in the strength of the market and also the strength in ASP's, they also worked hard to manage the cost. In terms of our guidance for Q3, again we’ve looked at a variety of scenarios, I’m not going to lay out every one of the scenarios, but the things that we thought could happen. We are anticipating in our guidance that we have not resolved the dispute with the one customer that made the underpayment in Q2, so that is factored into our guidance. And then there's a variety of scenarios for the Apple contract manufacturers and also just the normal range of uncertainties that we have when we give guidance. Operator This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call? Steve Mollenkopf Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I also want to thank the employees for delivering a great quarter and particular the folks who are delivering on the new businesses. It was really a strong quarter and I appreciate all the hard work. We'll talk to everybody next quarter. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Rod Hall Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hope you can hear me okay. I just wanted to clarify George what you guys are saying about the withholding, and Derek as well. So our understanding is the rebates, the alleged rebates were withheld for a couple of quarters, and so it sounds like what you're saying is the amount of royalty withheld is catching up for two quarter of rebate withholdings.

Thank you. Derek Aberle Hey, Rod. This is Derek. So if you think about Q2 which we had talked about last quarter in our reporting obviously for this quarter. Basically what happened is, we have a dispute with Apple as to whether we owe them about $1 billion under a cooperation agreement we have. That spans over several quarters of possible payments. What they said in their complaint and what they ended up doing as it relates to the second quarter which are sales through the end of December of 2016 is they effectively withheld payment to their contract manufacturers who then in turn withheld payment to us for royalties that were owed under the contract manufacturers agreements with us in the amount of this disputed cooperation payment, which is about $1 billion. And so that is all reflected in Q2, and as George mentioned because the amounts were reported to us and acknowledged as due, and then we have the cash that we haven't paid to Apple, effectively we took the revenue in Q2 for the amount of the four royalties that were paid net the reserve we had for the payments that are being disputed going back towards Apple. So that's the situation on Q2. On Q3, the guidance as we mentioned includes sort of a variety of possible assumptions on what may play out in terms of what gets paid to us by the contract manufacturers for Q3. I would say the high end of the guidance would be reflective of us getting paid in full, but we've got some other scenarios that are reflected in the range. The agreement itself with Apple which is where we have the dispute of what is owed to them expired at the end of 2016, so has really no relevance or impact to what the contract manufacturers would owe us for sales during the March quarter which is the guidance we’ve provided for Q3. One last point on this is what is not contemplated in the guidance range is for the contract manufacturers to pay us nothing or very low amount. If that were to happen then we would update you all. George Davis Rod let me add one thing as well, when you look at Q2 you can look to the balance sheet and see the accounts receivable has had a fairly significant pop, not only because we've brought in RF360, but the receivable is up by the - $1 billion of that is the amount owed by the CM’s which are not disputing the fact that they have reported and are obligated to pay under the contract for this amount. So it has shown as a receivable. We are still holding the $1 billion related to the dispute from the prior quarters under current liabilities on our balance sheet. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Kulbinder Garcha Thanks. Along the same subject I’m afraid and then - on the - just a clarification on your own building was withheld by the contract manufacturers, but something was paid to you, something else was paid to you above that level I assume and it’s not good lead indicator for being paid going forward, am I thinking if I wrong? Steve Mollenkopf No. Yes, go ahead and ask your second question, would jump and then… Kulbinder Garcha And then the other question was really more strategic about how the Apple and QUALCOMM thing plays out. The Foxconn agreement you have is that due to expire anytime soon? I assume it's not you haven't told us about device when it clarify that and it's very rare from what I can remember where you have an agreement with a party and it just stopped paying you. You had a deals expired in the past and you've had disputes perhaps and you have people that want to report on you all day, but is has ever been a scenario where you've had an agreement that last or some period of time and vendor in question just stops paying? George Davis So Kulbin, I'll take the first part of the question, which is what they paid to us, was simply the difference between the full amount owed under the contract minus the disputed amount. So there was some incremental payment that came in, but it was net of that $1 billion that that we described in the prepared remarks. Derek Aberle Yes, just to add to that - this is Derek. The cooperation agreement between QUALCOMM and Apple as I said expired at the end of 2016. So unlike Q2 there really is no basis on which to even argue that there should be a payment of something less than the full amount that the contract manufacturers owed to us. In terms of the Foxconn agreement, it's a long-term agreement. It is not set to expire any time soon. Those are again long-term agreements that are valid in binding and include the contractual obligation to pay the only thing that expired or the direct agreements between QUALCOMM and Apple and those went away at the end of 2016. And to your last point, yes it's been very rare, actually as I sit here can't think of a situation where somebody just simply stop paying us entirely under their agreement where we didn't have a dispute with them as to what they owed or some other thing going on, so that would be rare. Donald Rosenberg This is Don. Just to add one or two things. So to be clear, the excuse that the contract manufacturers used was that Apple wasn't paying them and what Apple was saying was that they are holding back payment to them to match the payments that they claim we owed them from the other agreement to BCPA, no connection to the license agreement between us and our contract manufacturers. So with this totally improper for the contract manufacturers to withhold and we now look at what they're going to do going forward and we say well even we excuse that they used before that is Apple claiming that they were making up for amounts that we didn't pay them doesn't exist anymore. So there doesn't seem to be even an arguable rational reason for anybody to withhold payments. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Mike Walkley with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead. Michael Walkley Great, thank you. Just staying on this topic, just trying to understand maybe the guidance in accounting ramifications, one, you have a licensee that you're dispute with and you didn't recognize $150 million in revenue and I think when you had a dispute with Nokia going back in time when they materially underpaid during that process you have withheld Nokia revenue from your guidance. So if say the contract manufacturers pay some smaller dollar amount that Apple theoretically said they should pay them, do you still recognize a portion of that revenue or do you just take out for altogether like maybe you've done with some of the licensee. Just trying to understand the accounting ramifications if there is any change from your licensee? And then my more fundamental question just on the outlook for QTL, if you can help just walk us on a sequential between seasonality of this the Apple range and then you had this licensee disputed maybe if you could help us just see the sequential decline kind of those different puts and takes that would be helpful? Thank you. Steve Mollenkopf So in terms of taking revenue in the case of a dispute, typically if there's a formal dispute then we would not take revenue until the dispute is resolved and I'll let Derek or Don comment on what constitutes the formal dispute, but certainly entry into arbitration or lawsuit is one case in the past. For the customer in the second quarter, the customer reported fully and underpaid and as not filed a formal dispute and in that case we take the revenue for the amount paid while we're working on collecting the balance owed from the customer. And then do you want to add to that at all? Derek Aberle Yes. I think just the difference Mike - this is Derek - in the two scenarios that the situation we have the current dispute where we didn't take revenue this quarter about 150 million - little more than 150 million. That situation where we did not get paid, so typically if there's a dispute and we're not getting paid, we wouldn't take the portion that's being withheld, which is different than if we are getting paid. On your sequence question, I think really got to remember the Q2 obviously is seasonally high quarter for the year, December quarter obviously typically the high quarter for QTL, so there would normally be a sequential decline going into Q3. I think other factors to consider, I would say we're assuming as I mentioned in my remarks that this dispute will not get resolved with the licensee we mentioned in Q3. So Q2 to Q3 were both assuming an underpayment and then we have a range of possibilities in the assumptions for what we'll get paid from the contract manufacturers supplying to Apple. If I up level it to the market, the market I think is continues to be quite strong. I would say it played out just a little bit differently in terms of what came in, in Q2 versus Q3. If you look at the TRDS range, we were above the high-end slightly of the Q2 TRDS range because of the phenomena of just more sales into China with a little inventory build that we expect will get sold through in Q3, which is therefore a bit of a drag on Q3 TRDS. So I think those are sort of the main drivers to keep in mind. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Tim Long Thank you. Just two quick ones if I could here. First, I just want to clarify the guidance for next quarter. Are you still booking the operating expenses or COGS hit that you were taking for the payment that was going back to Apple previously under that agreement. So if you can clarify if that's still hurting your EPS and reserving against it on the balance sheet and when would that change? And then secondly, the licensee with the $150 million dispute, Derek could you talk a little bit about, I know you can't get into too much of the details, but I just want to understand is this something that maybe is a by-product of other licensees seeing some of these special Apple agreements that were mentioned in their dispute in the BlackBerry arbitration and if not are you getting a lot of phone calls from other OEMs that have seen these other deals that they maybe do not have an understanding they have separate arrangements is that potentially causing any renegotiations? Thank you. Derek Aberle Tim on the - in terms of the accruals that we've taken, those stopped as the contract expires at the end of the calendar year with the last period that that would be reported in - for us was in fiscal Q2. George Davis And just to be - just a reminder, we didn't characterize sort of where those - were accruing on the P&L and that’s I don't want to make it seem like we're validating your description of them. On the second point, I think the way to think about that is the licensee with, which we have a dispute now, those discussions with the licensee I would say have been ongoing for some time and predated the filing in any of the litigation between us and Apple. A lot of times these discussions will go for a period of time before they escalate into a dispute and so that the timing is what it is, but I think it's important to note that the discussions leading up to dispute predated into the BlackBerry or the Apple litigation. And I don't really see a connection to that if you think about the BlackBerry decision. It really is an isolated agreement. And as I mentioned in my remarks even after we make the refund, the amount that BlackBerry paid per unit during that time period was basically consistent with the caps that we have for premium tier devices. So I don't anticipate really any impact from that decision on what other licensees would claim in terms of what it means to their agreements. The Apple situation as we mentioned in a lot of detail in our response, the terms under those agreements I think were grossly mischaracterized in Apple submission. So, yes we've had to have some discussions with licensees to try to clarify what it is and isn't. But I would say that's sort of normal course discussions we would typically have with companies. Steve Mollenkopf Tim, I would add that as I said in my prepared remarks that the disputed amounts under the cooperation agreement were accrued as a reduction to revenues in the P&L. So we can give that level of commentary. Operator Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, first on that the topic of royalties from the contract manufacturers, have you received any payments sense that the original lawsuit was filed and is that part of the reason that you feel comfortable assuming that at least some royalties will be paid and in the June quarter? And then I did want to touch quickly on the NXPI acquisition. Any update on timing of other regulatory body approvals? And can you give us a rough outline yet as to what the financing cost for that portion will be or what the interest rates may look like et cetera if and as that deal closes? Thank you very much. Derek Aberle Jim, this is Derek. On your first question about the contract manufacturers. So yes for Q2 what was reported and owed to us by the contract manufacturers actually exceeded the amount that's in dispute between QUALCOMM and Apple under the cooperation agreement. So we did receive payments under those licenses for the difference as George mentioned between what those companies owed and basically the disputed amount that Apple withheld. And for the Q3, basically we've already received royalty reports from most of the contract manufacturer suppliers to Apple and believe there is a clear and binding payment obligation as it relates to those payments and there is no dispute about other money that is owed from QUALCOMM to Apple. So again if these licensees are operating in accordance with the terms of the agreement they should pay and they should pay the full amount, but again more - a little cautious until we actually get the payment in hand and so that's reflected in the guidance as well as just pointing out that the situation where there's zero payment is not reflected in our range today. Donald Rosenberg This is Don. On the NXP question. So yes, we're pretty much moving as expected as Steve mentioned, we have past the HSR process in the U.S. We should be filing very shortly in Europe and we filed in China already that has not yet been doctored by China, but it's there. And we would anticipate filing in the other jurisdiction very quickly after we’ve completed filing in Europe. So we believe we’re still on track, and we're moving forward. George Davis On the financing front, we expect to be in the market in the second half, we have not put out an estimate yet on the financing costs. No material change in our expected sizing, which was between $10 billion and $12 billion of acquisition debt. But the form of that debt, the term and the tenor will all have an impact on estimated cost and we're not locked down on those yet. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Simona Jankowski Hi. Thank you very much. First, I just wanted to clarify if the payments to Apple under the BCPA were previously reported as comes from revenues in QCT or in QTL. And then the question on the new licensee that was underpaying in the quarter, did they still pay the majority of what they owed you or what’s the $150 million that they underpaid in fact the majority of what they owed you? And then along the same lines, your accounts receivable increased by about $2 billion of which you commented that $1 billion was due to the Apple withholding and then some of that was the TDK joint venture, but in the filing - in the Q, you also say that some of the increase was due to the delayed payments of other licensees. So I was just curious if there are other potential disputes that contributed to that or if that's just purely timing? Derek Aberle Hi, Simona. This is Derek. Maybe I'll take the first two and then George can take the last one. Yes, the amounts that are in dispute between us and Apple as we mentioned last quarter have been fully accounted for and run through the P&L in prior quarters. We did not specify sort of where in the P&L, the various payments were flowing and I think at this time are going to continue on that path. As to the dispute with the licensee, I'm not sure I can characterize majority versus minority, but they did pay a significant amount of royalties to us and didn't withhold - they withheld only a portion of what they owed not the entire payment. George Davis So on the accounts receivable outside of the Apple related $1 billion and the RF360 amounts, what you had was growth in receivables related to QCT, which was just a timing issue or payment relative to when shipments were made. And then on the QTL piece that is really just the timing of payments that are being made on some of the catch up payments where they're spread out over a short period of time just to allow customers to get caught up in addition to fully paying at their new run rate. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Stacy Rasgon Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I know you're making the point that the contract manufacturers are under obligation to pay no matter what they're getting from Apple, but let's be honest they're going to pay you whatever they get from Apple given presumably. So given what you know at this point of Apple's intentions, how can we assess that risks just the fact that you're - you aren't contemplating Apple completely ceasing their payments, so I just think you judge their risk of that happen to be lower, it's just not a scenario that you want to contemplate at this point? And on the revenue recognition, you give us some good color on kind of what constitutes a deferral versus not, but let's just say hypothetically next quarter the contract manufacturers were to pay you 50% of what you believe they owe you for Q3. Would you be able to recognize all that 50% or would you have to defer at that point and send an arbitration and call it zero? How do we think about revenue recognition depending on what's coming in? Donald Rosenberg Stacy, this is Don. Maybe a couple of us who would want to respond to the first question, but yes, to start what you said, I understand it’s a figure of speech, let's be honest. We are being honest and what is a good thing to think about is I disagree with you that it's a foregone conclusion. As I said earlier, Apple's claimed in its case against us is that they would held the specific amount of money in payments to their contract manufacturers because they said it's an offset against money that they claim, we withheld from them improperly in another contract. While we disagree with that claim obviously, the rationale for that no longer applies. As Derek said earlier, that BCPA contract is expired. So they're no more moneys even arguably due from us to them and therefore no basis or rationale to continue withholding from the contract manufacturers. And as Derek also said the contract manufacturers have valid binding contracts with us and our expectation is that they will abide by those obligations and pay us the amount they owe us, which they reported for the quarter. Derek Aberle Stacy, this is Derek. I think on your second question, I think probably the best way to think about it is, we’d have to wait and see all of the circumstances under which the revenue got reported and paid to us to sort of make a final judgment on that, but at a high level I would say we have binding valid agreements with them if they reported half of what they owe and paid that to us. I think the most likely scenario is as long as we're not in litigation with them that we would recognize that revenue within the quarter that is paid. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Tavis McCourt with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Tavis McCourt Hey, thanks for taking my questions. The $150 million or so license payments that have been withheld in the second quarter, was that contemplated in your second quarter guidance or is that something that happened after the last report? And then, so just to be clear on the contract manufacturers payments for your third quarter guidance, the high end of the guidance would presume they pay in full, but there's no presumption of, obviously, the cooperation agreement payments from you towards Apple with that guidance? Is that correct? George Davis Let me start with your first question which was - we did not contemplate the underpayment in the Q2 guidance. It’s one of the reasons why we made the point that actually if you factor that out it was a strong quarter for QTL, they were able to come in at expectation despite that, and you saw that in the strength of the market and also the strength in ASP's, they also worked hard to manage the cost. In terms of our guidance for Q3, again we’ve looked at a variety of scenarios, I’m not going to lay out every one of the scenarios, but the things that we thought could happen. We are anticipating in our guidance that we have not resolved the dispute with the one customer that made the underpayment in Q2, so that is factored into our guidance. And then there's a variety of scenarios for the Apple contract manufacturers and also just the normal range of uncertainties that we have when we give guidance. Operator This ends our allotted time for questions and answers. Mr. Mollenkopf, do you have anything further to add before adjourning the call? Steve Mollenkopf Well, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I also want to thank the employees for delivering a great quarter and particular the folks who are delivering on the new businesses. It was really a strong quarter and I appreciate all the hard work. We'll talk to everybody next quarter. Thank you. Operator Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Now, I'd like to introduce Greg Maffei, Liberty Interactive's President and CEO. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. Thank you, Courtnee. Good morning to all of you. Today, speaking on the call, we will have Liberty Interactive's CFO, Mark Carleton; QVC's President and CEO, Mike George; and the President and CEO of zulily, Darrell Cavens. Since TripAdvisor doesn't report earnings until tomorrow, we will not be taking any questions regarding Liberty TripAdvisor on this call. So on to the highlights. We were very pleased with the improvement in the QVC U.S. business. Revenue was down about 3% in the first quarter, a great improvement from Q4, even with approximately 1.5% of headwind due to the absence of a leap year this year compared to last year. The extra leap day was costly to that amount. Operating income was flat, and adjusted OIBDA was up 3%. QVC International grew 2% in constant currency with operating income up 20% and adjusted OIBDA up 15%. Consolidated mobile penetration was 62% of QVC.com orders continuing its pace, that was up 560 basis points. The Q team is doing a very good job driving this business in a difficult retail environment. zulily grew revenue only 1%, and Darrell will be on to discuss the factors impacting his business in a moment. We repurchased $77 million of QVC A shares from Feb 1 to April 30. I'd like to note that we were out of the market on share repurchases for part of this period due to the previously announced GCI deal. As we've discussed, our buyback strategy is to target annual buybacks to match the free cash flow of QVC, and this remains our strategy. At Liberty Ventures, we are thrilled to announce the planned acquisition of GCI, the largest telecommunications company in Alaska and the combined split-off of Liberty ventures. Let's review some of the highlights of that transaction. We are structurally creating real value for the QVC Group and Liberty Ventures' shareholders by reducing tracking stock discounts through the creation of asset-backed securities and providing greater flexibility for future strategic acquisitions and combinations. So why GCI? This is the Goldilocks deal, in our mind, for many reasons. We needed something that fit well with our existing cable assets in Liberty Ventures and was the right size compared to the existing assets and businesses of Liberty Ventures, didn't want it to be too big given share issuance and dilution, nor too small, given structuring and regulatory considerations. It is very nice to see the market grok this deal for LVNTA, but this separation and reattribution are very positive for QVC Group as well. As a part of this transaction, there will be a reattribution of certain assets and liabilities from Liberty Ventures to QVC Group. We are re-attributing attractive tax shielding assets and liabilities to QVC Group, keeping them within the income tax generating assets, for example, QVC itself. This allows future cash generation from tax savings that can be used for stock repurchases, debt reduction or potentially strategic investments. Similarly, we are re-attributing cash from Liberty Ventures, which will provide an immediate source of liquidity, and this can also be used for stock repurchases, debt reduction or potential strategic investments. QVC Group will also receive the ILG stake, a potential source of future monetization or other strategic actions. The value of this reattribution was largely driven by the exchangeable debentures. If you recall, the exchangeable debentures are due in 2029, 2030 and 2031, and they have favorable tax attributes, and this was critical in determining fair value. With the help of a financial adviser, the same one that advised us in the previous re-attributions of these bonds – these same bonds, we looked at the value of the cash flow provided by these bonds against the principal and tax liability that would be due when these bonds mature. If tax rates change before the closing, this would factor into our calculation, which will be done at closing, but I would note there is a natural offset, as we said before, between tax deductions taken in the past, and therefore owed and future tax deductions. Additional information on these bonds is available in our Investor Day deck appendix from November 2016 and our deck from the announcement of the GCI deal in April of 2017. For Liberty-GCI, we see the transaction as credit positive over the long term given the assets of Liberty Ventures. But out of the gate, the asset coverage goes up from 5 times, from 1.5 times pre-contribution. GCI received consents recently from its bondholders and banks due to – to waive the change of control put and amend other particular terms of the indentures and credit agreements, respectively. We look forward to this deal closing early in Q1, 2018. So with that, let me turn it over to Mark Carleton to discuss the financials in more detail. Mark D. Carleton - Liberty Interactive Corp. Thank you, Greg. Let's take a little look at the liquidity picture. At the end of the quarter, the QVC Group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $379 million and $6.2 billion in principal amount of attributed debt. QVC, Inc.'s total debt to adjusted OIBDA ratio, as defined in the credit agreements, was approximately 2.7 times, which includes zulily's adjusted OIBDA as compared to a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 3.5x. So in good position there. Now, I hand it over to Mike George for some additional comments on QVC. Mike? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thank you, Mark. I'd like to start today's call by just taking a moment to appreciate our more than 17,000 QVC team members around the world, who in good times and in bad remain passionately dedicated to our customers and our values and our business. And their focus and their determination, I think, are beautifully reflected in our results this quarter. While our sales are still not where we want them to be, the substantial improvement in the U.S. sales trend, the consistent performance internationally, the significant increase in profit margins, despite the promotional environment at retail, the numerous recognitions we've recently received for customer service, these are all a wonderful testament to our QVC people, and I'm grateful for their efforts to go above and beyond every day. We delivered strong improvement in the U.S. sales trend in Q1, and while we won't be satisfied until we get to positive growth, this is an important progression in the second half of 2016, and we believe the strategies we've shared with you on recent calls contributed to our improved results. We also achieved solid and stable revenue growth in our International segment and strong growth in operating income margin and adjusted OIBDA margins with U.S. operating income margin up 40 basis points and adjusted OIBDA margin up 130 basis points, and International operating income margin up 170 basis points and adjusted OIBDA margin up 180 basis points. And despite the deceleration in sales at zulily, we remain highly confident in its long-term business model. QVC's consolidated operating income was up 5%, adjusted OIBDA grew 6%, and revenue declined 1% on a constant currency basis. On a trailing 12-month basis, we served 12.7 million customers, largely flat to last year, excluding our China – that excludes our China joint venture. Digital engagement increased sharply with global e-commerce and mobile penetration growing approximately 350 basis points and 560 basis points respectively in Q1. Our U.S. business demonstrated much progress. Revenues declined 3% and just 1% adjusting for the 1.5% impact of leap year, a material change in the trajectory from the second half of 2016. A key driver in the sales performance was improvement in average selling price trends. The ASP declined 5% in Q1 compared with an 8% decrease in Q4. We once again achieved growth in total units sold and in units sold per customer as our customers remain highly engaged with QVC. Our 40 basis point operating income margin and 130 basis point adjusted OIBDA margin improvements in the U.S. were primarily due to favorable fixed costs that includes a lower severance and an insurance settlement, improved product margins, higher credit card income, customer service efficiencies, and lower marketing and lower bad debt expenses, partially offset by higher warehouse costs due to ASP deleverage and the ramp-up of our Ontario distribution center. We're beginning to see the impact from our strategies to return the U.S. business to growth. As we've discussed, our first priority is driving more balanced growth across categories. In Q1, we achieved gains in apparel and beauty and good sequential improvement in the five underperforming category segments that pressured our results last year. Those segments, jewelry, electronics, kitchen/cook, hair care and handbags, were approximately 31% of the sales mix in Q1 and declined 11% year-over-year compared to the 19% decline in Q4 and the 24% decline in Q3. To achieve more balanced growth across categories, we're leaning into our core brand values of discovery, freshness and diversity. In Q1, we introduced 95 new brands. That's a 27% year-over-year increase, and we increased the number of new items launched across all brands by 12%. In beauty alone, we've introduced 24 new brands year-to-date. Top Q1 launches include Kristofer Buckle, which sold out of all items; the re-launch of Bobbi Brown; and skincare brand, Crepe Erase. In apparel, we're seeing a continued strong performance of newer brands, Peace Love World, Belle by Kim Gravel and Hot in Hollywood, along with strength at many of our exclusive lifestyle brands like Lori Goldstein and Isaac Mizrahi Live! In footwear, we launched ED by Ellen DeGeneres in March to strong initial results. And looking to Q2, we have many additional new brands launching in footwear, accessories, travel and handbags. In particular, we're excited about the addition of Mephisto and Gentle Souls by Kenneth Cole in footwear and the launch of our leading European handbag line, Kipling. It's also worthy that we mention that we introduced Dooney & Bourke on zulily in Q1 to strong results. In home, we're focused on diversity and discovery. We launched nearly 30 new brands in kitchen/cook and another 26 in household and garden in Q1. Food, gardening, fitness and mattresses were a leading category segments with particular strength from Fitbit, Total Gym and Serta. And in April, we saw strong performance in home automation with Ring doorbell. In electronics, we reduced airtime and drove improved permanent productivity. Areas of strength include a smart home with Blink home security and all-in-one and 2-in-1 touch laptops. And Amazon continues to be one of our fastest growing vendors in both Echo and tablets. In jewelry, having focused last year on clearing out stale inventory to make room for fresh product, we were able to increase the number of new items over 50% in the quarter. We were especially pleased with the launch of Lola Rose, a top jewelry brand in our UK business as well as the reintroduction of the Imperial Gold brand, which has not been on QVC for 5 years. Our second strategy in the U.S. turnaround is to accelerate new customer acquisition. And while U.S. new customer growth declined moderately in Q1, the trend improved significantly from full-year 2016. And more importantly, we saw solid growth in new customers per minute in most of our category segments, adjusting for leap year, with those gains offset by unfavorable category mix. Expanding reach and relevance across broadcast and digital platforms is the third key strategy in our U.S. business. Our actions are designed to increase the number of purchase occasions we capture from existing customers and to increase the number of new customers acquired. We've been encouraged by the performance of our second U.S. network. And on April 1, we renamed and re-launched the channel as QVC2, as a part of our strategy to build QVC2 into a destination network. We introduced a Deal of the Day the QVC2 Big Deal, similar to our main channel, TSV, which has generated strong early results with five sellouts to date. We've doubled the number of live hours per week to 40 to capitalize on the higher productivity of live shows. We're creating new and unique programming and destination shows that are exclusive to QVC2 such as In the Kitchen with Mary, PM Style with Leah and AM Style with Gabrielle. And over time, we intend to build a portfolio of brands that are primarily or only available on QVC2. We continue to be pleased with Beauty iQ, our third U.S. network, which was launched last fall and currently reaches more than 40 million homes, including the addition of Verizon HD in Q1 with 20 hours of live programming. Now, the Beauty's deal, the networks equivalent of the TSV, has performed well with four sellouts to date. We're utilizing social programs to extend Beauty iQ's reach and drive engagement, including launching a monthly blogger program, in which top tier beauty bloggers will create videos, feature new beauty product or topic. The blogger segments will appear in Beauty iQ and be promoted on their social networks along with ours. We've also initiated #QtheBeauty, a monthly trend identified by our beauty buyers. And we continue to utilize compelling events, remotes and celebrity connections across our business to generate entertaining, engaging programming across networks and to extend our reach. We hosted and inspired style remote broadcast from New York City during Fashion Week. Last month, we aired a two-hour remote event from Lisa Rinna's California home to celebrate the fifth anniversary of her product line on QVC. We simulcast the show on Facebook Live, reaching nearly 1 million people, our most popular Facebook Live broadcast to date. Program host David Venable and QVC vendor Rachael Ray teamed up with a segment on the Rachael Ray Show. And later in May, we'll broadcast In the Kitchen with David from San Francisco. And for the third year, we've teamed up with NBC's Today Show to give inventors a chance to earn a spot on QVC. Like the previous year, this year's winner sold out his product, Frywall, a Silicone Splatter guard, during the on-air broadcast on QVC. And last week, we were really excited to announce a new multiyear agreement for the Martha Stewart brand. Under this agreement, QVC will launch several categories for the brand, including skincare, fashion apparel and food and beverage. The new collaboration is expected to launch in the second half of this year and will feature frequent appearances with dedicated programming on QVC, QVC2 and Beauty iQ by Martha and a team of Martha's favorite experts as they showcase new products and share tips on how to incorporate them into everyday living. QVC at its core is about the joy of discovery and the power of relationships, and few do a better job of connecting with fans and inspiring them to embrace new ideas than Martha Stewart. And so we really look forward to this new collaboration. Investing in our digital platforms. In the U.S., e-commerce grew 390 basis points to 54% of sales and mobile rose 520 basis points to 61% of digital orders. And we launched significant changes to the digital experience to highlight all three of our networks and to drive integration across our TV and digital platforms. We have a mobile-first philosophy with a video-centric approach. In Q2, we'll launch new iOS and Android apps that provide an enhanced video experience and leverage our global e-commerce platforms. We're also expanding our product assortment on digital to support discovery, freshness and product diversity. And in mid-April, we launched StudioQ hosted by zulily, a new, online experience that offers deep discounts on brand names and designer products, that creates more curated assortments by tapping zulily's personalization strengths while delivering a QVC-branded experience. And finally, on the U.S., it's worth noting that throughout the U.S. downturn, we maintained an intense focus, as we always do, on customer service. And so we were especially proud to be recognized for this commitment. QVC was tied for the number one retailer in the 2017 Temkin Experience Ratings and in the 2017 Stevie Awards, we received a Gold award for E-Commerce Customer Service and a silver for the Retail Customer Service department of the year. We are further advancing our focus on customer service by combining QVC and zulily's customer service organizations under a common management structure. And we're integrating Facebook Messenger under our platform, learning from zulily's pioneering work with Messenger, giving customers another medium to interact with us for customer service. Turning now to our International segment, revenue increased 2% and closer to 4%, excluding the leap day impact on a constant currency basis, with unit volume up 4% and ASP down 2% in constant currency. We experienced gains in all categories, except jewelry and electronics. And just as the U.S. is benefiting from our OneQ structure with the introduction of international brands, our International segment is leveraging the U.S. brands. Since the launch of OneQ, we've launched 44 U.S. brands in non-U.S. markets. In Q1, we continued this brand development, introducing some 10 U.S. brands in our International segment, including Clarks and TULA from our global brand portfolio as well as Marc Fisher, Peace Love World and our proprietary brand, AnyBody. QVC International grew operating income 20% and adjusted OIBDA 15% on a constant currency basis, and operating income margin and adjusted OIBDA margin increased 170 basis points and 180 basis points, respectively. Primarily due to favorable fixed costs that included lower severance as well as higher product margins, customer service efficiencies and favorable inventory obsolescence and warehouse expenses. Now, these factors are partially offset by higher TV distribution commissions in the UK. Our Japan business was a particular highlight. It grew local currency revenue in the mid-single digits and delivered strong operating income and adjusted OIBDA improvement. Our European businesses continue to generate solid performance, led by Germany and Italy, which delivered solid top line gains and margin expansion. The UK's top line softened, consistent with the overall UK retail sector, but we continue to have a high degree of confidence in that business, which has demonstrated solid results for many years. Our France launch does continue to underperform our expectations, and we're continuing to broaden assortments and test heavier levels of ad spend to see if we can accelerate customer acquisition. And in China, we are pleased to deliver local currency sales gains. And as a reminder, our China JV is not in our consolidated results. Now, I will turn it over to Darrell. Darrell Cavens - zulily LLC Thanks, Mike, and thanks, everybody, for joining today's call. As we mentioned during last quarter's call, we faced tough comps for the first half of 2017 and we are disappointed in our top line growth for Q1. We continue to focus on our marketing and merchandising efforts and believe our continued investments and initiatives will deliver stronger growth. Revenue for the quarter increased 1%, driven by a 4% increase in the number of orders placed per active customer. This variance was primarily due to stronger sales later in the first quarter 2017 compared to the prior year. And revenue associated with these sales was deferred until the second quarter of 2017. In Q1 last year, we had some very large sales events from a few national brands that we were challenged to comp this year. These events impacted our revenue by approximately 300 basis points. Additionally, our results include an approximately 1% impact from the leap year. Operating loss improved 12% to $38 million for Q1 2017 due to decelerating amortization of intangible assets related to purchase accounting in Q1 2016. Adjusted OIBDA declined 35% to $15 million, but please remember that OIBDA last year grew 475%, so our two-year OIBDA growth was 275%. Gross margin declined 180 basis points as a result of higher supply chain expenses due to an increase in international as well as a variation in our product mix. We experienced strong growth in our home business, which typically has slightly lower margins. We expect some margin pressure to continue through rest of the year as we invest in technology in our third-party fulfillment service offering at our new Bethlehem, Pennsylvania facility. Our emphasis on delivering unique products and differentiated brands at great values is what attracts and then keeps our customers coming back to us again and again. Our loyal customers continue to engage with us with 93% of purchases during Q1 of 2017 coming from existing customers, up from 90% last year. We saw a strong growth in our women's and home categories, and we're excited to introduce our customers some great new brands, such as Dooney & Bourke, which we leverage from the QVC brand portfolio and Banana Republic Factory. As we continue to see strong growth in categories like women's and home, we've seen sales softness in our kids business. Our merchandising and marketing teams are focused on updating our offering to drive growth in this category, which we believe represents a strong long-term opportunity for our business. Last year, our focus was primarily on improving the daily customer experience and driving efficiency in our marketing spend. This resulted in some pullback in marketing spend, particularly in Q4, which is now resulting in headwinds to demand in Q1. Marketing continues to be an area we're putting a significant amount of management focus. During the quarter, we shifted marketing efforts to better align with our internal goals of driving an increase in active customers by making changes across technology and marketing that allow us to optimize to a new set of metrics and spend more efficiently. In Q1, we tripled the number of digital ad tests we are running. We also continue to diversify our marketing portfolio and invest in content for new emerging platforms such as Facebook Live and Hulu, with an increased focus on driving new customers. We're seeing the early benefits of these changes through significantly improved customer acquisition costs and new customer growth. In addition to focusing on new customers, we're excessively focused on making people passionate fans of zulily. Mobile continues to be a key driver of engagement with 67% of orders during the quarter coming from mobile, up from 62% in Q1 of 2016. We remain committed to enhancing our customer experience in programs and extending the lifetime value of our customers. I pulled together a group of leaders from across the company to focus on increasing customer retention, and I'm excited to see the early efforts they're putting in place. We continue to expand our third-party fulfillment services program. This is a program which vendors pay us to store their inventory on our warehouses for our events or other retail channels they sell-through without bringing inventory on to our balance sheet. By expanding a number of units readily available in our warehouses, we've been able to increase the volume of events that feature products that can ship in one to two days. In the last few weeks, we've launched programs to increase visibility of these products to our customers, which we believe can drive an incremental set of conversions and ultimately increase sales with broader fast ship inventory. We will continue to improve and expand our offerings here. Additionally, I'm excited to announce that we recently signed an agreement with Synchrony Bank to offer customers revolving credit for purchasing merchandise through zulily-branded credit cards. We're able to work with the teams at Synchrony and QVC to learn from their long-term relationship and help us move quickly to get a strong agreement in place for all parties. This will include the ability for us to accept QVC's QCard on zulily.com. Under the agreement, zulily will receive a portion of the net economics from the credit card program. We plan to launch the program in late 2017 or early 2018. We continue to be excited about the future we have ahead. For Q2, we'll continue to face tough comps, but I remain confident in our initiatives that we have underway across the company to drive incremental sales growth. I believe the investments we're making in marketing, technology and supply chain will allow us to continue to drive strong growth and profitable growth over time. We look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming quarters. With that, let me turn the call back over to Mark. Mark D. Carleton - Liberty Interactive Corp. Thank you, Darrell. Now, moving on to the Liberty Ventures liquidity, at the end of the quarter, the group had attributed cash and liquid investments of $442 million and a short $2 billion in principal amount of attributed debt. The value of public equity method securities, including Liberty Broadband and other public holdings attributed to the group was $4.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, at the end of the quarter, so in good shape. And with that, I'll hand it back to Greg. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. Thanks, Mike, Darrell and Mark. To the listening audience, we appreciate your continued interest in Liberty Interactive. And with that, operator, let's open the floor for questions. Courtnee Chun - Liberty Interactive Corp. Operator? Question-and-Answer Session Operator Yes, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with Pacific Crest. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. Nice to see the improvement in QVC. Can you talk a little about the credit business? I know you said that you saw an improvement kind of in delinquencies. What is the role of credit kind of longer term? If you look back kind of it's on the difficulty you had, any learnings from that period? And I guess, kind of Easy Pay, has there been any structural changes with the way that you're applying it? Thanks. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Yeah, thanks for the question. Credit continues to be a important part of the value equation to our customers. And as you know, we had a rise in bad debt a couple of quarters back. Our overall bad debt rates are relatively modest. Our credit write-off rates are kind of at the low end of benchmark, so we feel very good about that program. I guess the way I would characterize it is, our approach is largely to be kind of stable and not materially increase or decrease the usage of credit as a part of value proposition. And so in Q1, you saw about stable performance in terms of the amount of credit that we offered. And I think that's what we'll look at going forward. Because we're not a highly promotional retailer, because we don't offer free shipping on everything. The way we create a unique value proposition is through the Easy Pay program. Our learning from a year ago is just to keep it stable and make sure we're monitoring the trends very carefully and able to kind of pull back if we see any wobble in performance. But right now, I'd characterize it as very stable. The other part, of course, in the credit story at QVC, and Darrell referenced it as well, is our QCard program and soon our zuCard program, that's a very attractive program that adds meaningful economics to the business as we share in the income generated on the card with our partners at Synchrony. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Victor Anthony with Aegis Capital. Victor Anthony - Aegis Capital Corp. One for Mike, one for Greg. So Mike, of all the, I guess, initiatives that you called out with merchandising programming, I guess new customer acquisition, secondary networks. What would you point to as a primary reason for the improving sales trend in the domestic U.S. business? And Greg, if you just comment, if you can, on the transaction yesterday with Pandora we'd love to hear your thoughts, what you think about out there? Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. I'll interrupt and go first and note that this is not the Liberty Media call, so you're going to have to hold that one till later. Mike? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. So in terms of primary driver, not to dodge the question, but I don't think we could point to any one of those initiatives as being a primary driver. When the business gets tough as it did in the back half, it's usually a confluence of multiple factors and to get it better, we need a confluence of positive factors. So the additional focus on the secondary networks certainly helped with growth. But all the work to just diversify product assortments keep moving to what was working in the business, adding more energy and excitement in the programming, every one of those elements, I think, contributed to the results. So, I do feel good that we've got a team that's kind of executing well and working on multiple initiatives in what continues to be a challenged retail environment to win in the marketplace. And I think we'll kind to see that story continue. Victor Anthony - Aegis Capital Corp. And if I could just ask a follow-up in terms of just looking forward in terms of country launches. Could you give us an update on how you think about expanding internationally? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Yeah. At this point, we're not actively focused on international expansion. Our priority is, we like to see the French business get stronger, and we are continuing to work on the China business as well. So we are open-minded about international expansion and we have a team that's kind of always looking at opportunities. And so if a really attractive opportunity emerged, we might jump on it. But at this point, I would say our emphasis has shifted more towards what we're seeing as the strong impact of investing in these secondary networks, which we've talked a lot about in the U.S., but we're also investing in secondary networks in Germany and the UK. And in some ways we think about those as opening up new markets, same geographic region, but new ways to reach more customers, that feels like it's more leverageable than the next set of international markets to expand into. Victor Anthony - Aegis Capital Corp. Okay. Thank you very much. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital. Alex Joseph Fuhrman - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great to taking my question. I would love for you, if you could size up a little bit for us the magnitude of the improvement in March, just trying to understand some of the comments you made on the last conference call, I think you said that January and February were tracking down roughly 3.5%. And then considering the impact of the leap year on top of that, it seems like March would have shown some pretty solid growth. So just want to make sure we're doing that math correctly. And then as we think about how Easter progressed, can you just give us a sense of how important, or I should say, April, can you give us a sense of how important Easter is to the month of April and if that caused any sort of a shift with Easter being later in the quarter this year? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Alex, I appreciate the question. I don't want to get into too much detail on kind of the sequential trends, because there's so much volatility in our programming schedule. You mentioned the Easter shift, which really makes both March and April not comparable to the prior year. So I would say – I would probably generally characterize it as we felt that improving trend as more and more of initiatives we put into place started to get traction, but also we're trying to draw some straight line there, because there are lots of other factors that play into that in the programming calendar. And I'll probably kind of shy away from any comments about the current quarter. April is not hugely meaningful to the business, but it has some impact. But I don't want to get into kind of details about Q2 at this point. Alex Joseph Fuhrman - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Sure. That makes sense, Mike. And then curious to see, you talked about some of the equivalent of the TSVs being launch on QVC2 and the beauty channel. Do you feel looking out into the back half of the year? Are there enough TSVs to go around? I mean, could you have a full, robust complement of beauty and QVC2, TSVs, and did you feel that won't impact or might that have some impact on what you're able to show as your top deal a day on the primary channel? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. It's something that we're watching very carefully and kind of learning as we go. I think it's all about relative expectations. So certainly, we don't expect these secondary channel promotions to be anywhere near the magnitude of the TSV. So, I think of these three very special deals, the TSV will always be the most special, it's certainly where we'll get majority of the volume. And we're going to always kind of reserve our biggest opportunities for that channel. But there's also an opportunity to be creative with the big deals and the beauty's deals. Doing things on those channels that might not make sense on the main channel, might not be a mass enough audience or mass enough idea, but it still be very attractive. So, I think it opens up opportunities to experiment with different kinds of daily deals that kind of earn a spot on the main channel. So, I think we have a lot of opportunities to expand that program before we really risk cannibalizing the TSV. Alex Joseph Fuhrman - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC That's helpful. Thank you, Mike. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning, thank you for taking my call. I was just wondering, in terms of the balance sheet, pre and post GCI, how you're thinking about capital priorities, just given the fact that you're taking on eventually the deferred tax liability from the debentures? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. So, I'll take the first shot at that, and Mark or Mike certainly can add. We are going to provide both immediate liquidity for QVC Group through the transference of cash, and as we've noted, assets which are salable and future tax benefits. So yes, there is a deferred liability out there, but it is 29, 30, 31, and in the interim, substantially increasing cash flows. And frankly, we'll continue to evaluate whether we're going to use that for debt reduction or incremental approaches or if we find something attractive to invest in. But I would note that our first priority has been maintaining a stable sort of capital structure and using incremental cash flows to share repurchase, and I don't expect that to change. Guys, Mark or Mike, do you want to add anything? No. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Nothing else. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. Great. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great, thanks. Operator Your next question is from the line of Tom Forte with Maxim Group. Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, Mike, congrats on the improving trends at QVC. The question I has for Mike, on consumer electronics, is connected home a big enough category to offset the transition to tablet from desktop/laptop and kind of a lackluster TV? Or is that going to be just a continued challenging category until you see something either on the tablet or TV side? Thanks. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thanks, Tom. I would say, today, connected home is not big enough to fill in for a declining computer and tablet business. So, I would say, we're cautious in the outlook for consumer electronics. As I mentioned, we did further pullback airtime in the quarter and saw improved sales per minute as a result, but not kind of absolute growth. I would hope that we are past the worst of the pressure, because we have now kind of anniversaried a very large computer and tablet business. And we've seen some innovations in some segments, the all-in-ones and 2-in-1s, as I mentioned. So what I would hope is, as we've seen some steep declines in computer and tablet, those start to just sort of naturally moderate. And there're some innovations in some sub-segments of those categories, and then we'll start to see some growth for connected home. But whether all that adds up to top-line growth in consumer electronics, we'll have to see. We're not necessarily banking on that and believe we have to have other vehicles for growth. Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC Thanks, Mike. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from the line of James Ratcliffe with Evercore-ISI. James Ratcliffe - Evercore-ISI Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I've two on the Ventures side, if I could. First of all, when you – it looks like you will have about $1.2 billion or $1. 3 billion in cash in the FTD and other stakes once you're done. How much cash does GCI actually need, and how much is going to be sort of available potentially for other purposes within that business? And secondly, are there benefits to GCI from being a, call it, cousin of Charter effectively sort of within the Liberty family, even though they're not part of the same corporate unit? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. So on the first point, GCI will be a free cash flow generator, not consumer. So we anticipate having shared – cash available for other purposes. And candidly, we're bullish on Charter. And if we continue to trade at a discount, GCI at a discount to – and the GCI Liberty complex at a discount to Broadband, and therefore, even bigger discount to Charter, that's only opportunity. Whether we can achieve something, because we're part of a Charter family, we'll have to work on that. There is no direct ownership from Charter, so that is probably a second-order opportunity, not a first-order one. But certainly, we're cognizant of the fact that Charter runs a video business with much higher margins opportunity compared to smaller cable operators, like GCI. James Ratcliffe - Evercore-ISI And just a follow-up. Are there any limits other than tax considerations around the monetization of the LendingTree or FTD effects? Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. No. I don't – I would say not – it's slightly more complicated, but no – in general, no. James Ratcliffe - Evercore-ISI Thank you. Operator Your next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Just a question for Mr. Maffei. For many, many years, anytime the investment community asked you about potentially buying a portion of HSNi that you don't own, you've always pointed investors towards the multiple disparity between Q and H. For some reason, the buy side feels like your narrative has sort of changed on that or maybe less sensitive to that metric than you've been in the past. Is that true? Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. No. My philosophy is exactly the same. We weigh the multiple, in particular, I'd note, not just the EBITDA multiple, but the free cash flow multiple, because the EBITDA multiples have converged, but the free cash flow multiples are still fairly far apart. We weigh those, and clearly then we expect there would be some synergy values, but historically, we have found, in our judgment, that they are not sufficient, the synergies to overcome that multiple differential. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. Always evaluate it on that basis. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Operator The next question is from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the encouraging trend at QVC in the U.S. And if we do kind of a two-year stack on the ex-leap day kind of growth, and we are up 3%. And I know you don't really want to guide, but just to kind of push a little bit on that or even talk about initial quarter trends. But just to push a little bit on that, is there any reason that we shouldn't think that that two-year stack can persist for the balance of the year. Was there anything unusual in the first quarter that seems like it wouldn't be repeatable as we go through the year? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Bart, I don't think there's anything especially unusual in the first quarter. So to your point, we do feel good about the two-year stack and that would suggest opportunity in the back half. But we have to get there and get to the back half to see it. So as you know, Q1 and Q2 were roughly similar in year-over-year growth rates a year ago. Q2 was more volatile, really strong growth in tough comps in April-May, and then big erosion in June, but the overall quarter kind of ended up similar to Q1. And then we get obviously to much easier comps in the back half. So once we get to the back half and start to lap those easier comps, I would certainly hope that that pretends very well for the business. We certainly feel very good about the initiatives we're taking, but not just hope, but to actually have a series of programs that will drive growth. But beyond that, I don't want to speculate until we get there and start to earn on the results. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. And just to understand this a little bit more clearly, is the Easter shift helpful for the second quarter and a headwind for the first quarter or the inverse of that or does it not even really matter? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. I don't think it's hugely important. The shift in the April might be just the way the – the way the calendar float altogether, I would say was modestly more favorable for Q1 than for Q2 in terms of the shift of Easter, but also just the timing of it. I don't know that I see that as necessarily a big driver of impact at either Q1 or Q2, so if I were to characterize it, I would say was maybe a modest – very modest negative, but not that material. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. And then, if I can put this out to Greg or Mark. You've got the extra cash coming or cash capacity coming to QVC, you've said that your goal is on repurchase just to use your free cash flow to fund repurchase. Is there an opportunity maybe to have an exception to that for a period of time as you move the cash over to QVC as you merge ventures into GCI? Mark D. Carleton - Liberty Interactive Corp. Well, I tried to talk about this a little earlier, Barton. I think we're going to evaluate that. Clearly, we have incremental cash, and we're going to have incremental free cash flow because of the tax-sheltering nature of those exchangeables. And certainly on the – what we do with the one-time and the fact that we'll have the incremental cash flows, we're going to evaluate. But I suspect, we'll certainly use the continuing free cash flow and look at share repurchase carefully. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay, great. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from the line of Matthew Harrigan with Wunderlich. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly, Martha Stewart was a pretty big brand back in the MSO days and how much smaller is it now with sequential brands? I mean how much are you limited by working with sequential brands or are there actually opportunities to work with them for other personalities and such? And then the second question, guys like Gartner Group, and this is a little hype here really starting to talk of AI, machine learning for retailing. I mean, our – some of the European houses, I think, are like, looking at things like visual search and chatbots and all that to try to engage people. I mean, QVC's wheelhouse has always been personalization. I'm curious how much you think of that is high – for Mike, moving into the next decade? And how much is, at least preferably, beneficial or challenging to QVC? Thank you. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thanks. I'll start with the Martha question. We're very excited about this partnership with Martha and was sequential. And I think what sequential does is they have a capability in partnership with us to develop product lines across multiple categories. I will tell you that Martha is incredibly engaged and committed to this. And so we really see this as a kind of a next horizon together, the ability to really combine what Martha does so well in engaging an audience base and helping them understand how to lead a better life and to combine that with commerce. So we'll see, but we really feel good about both the product lines, sort of unique take of these products that Martha is bringing, and the commitment that she personally has made and her team has made to really been able to tell that story on QVC. So it's been a super partnership to-date and kind of we're all looking forward to launch. On the hype around AI and machine learning and all the rest, we'll have to see how things play out. But I do think we're getting to a point where these are becoming meaningful trends that I think could be helpful to our business, and the whole trend of conversational commerce. I think these are all interesting places for us to play in that, to your point, take what we've always been good at, personalization, we've just done it the old-fashioned way, and leverage new technologies. And I'll brag on zulily and Darrell and the team for a minute, because there many things we were excited about that acquisition and continue to be excited about is, zulily is a company that launches 10,000 new items a day, three to five images per item. And through machine learning in 30-second intervals from 6 AM on, the website gets smarter and smarter, geared to every individual customer, and starts to present items, images, offers, events to the customers based on their historic behavior and what segments they fall into. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. And so, zulily is ahead of QVC in thinking about machine learning. And we're talking a lot about how to leverage that capability with QVC. So we think there's a lot there. We don't think it's going to change the world overnight, but we think we've got a good partner in zulily to help us figure out how to, kind of, thrive in that environment. Matthew J. Harrigan - Wunderlich Securities, Inc. Thanks, Mike. Half year call, congratulations. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thank you. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp.

Your first question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with Pacific Crest. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Hi, thanks very much for taking my question. Nice to see the improvement in QVC. Can you talk a little about the credit business? I know you said that you saw an improvement kind of in delinquencies. What is the role of credit kind of longer term? If you look back kind of it's on the difficulty you had, any learnings from that period? And I guess, kind of Easy Pay, has there been any structural changes with the way that you're applying it? Thanks. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Yeah, thanks for the question. Credit continues to be a important part of the value equation to our customers. And as you know, we had a rise in bad debt a couple of quarters back. Our overall bad debt rates are relatively modest. Our credit write-off rates are kind of at the low end of benchmark, so we feel very good about that program. I guess the way I would characterize it is, our approach is largely to be kind of stable and not materially increase or decrease the usage of credit as a part of value proposition. And so in Q1, you saw about stable performance in terms of the amount of credit that we offered. And I think that's what we'll look at going forward. Because we're not a highly promotional retailer, because we don't offer free shipping on everything. The way we create a unique value proposition is through the Easy Pay program. Our learning from a year ago is just to keep it stable and make sure we're monitoring the trends very carefully and able to kind of pull back if we see any wobble in performance. But right now, I'd characterize it as very stable. The other part, of course, in the credit story at QVC, and Darrell referenced it as well, is our QCard program and soon our zuCard program, that's a very attractive program that adds meaningful economics to the business as we share in the income generated on the card with our partners at Synchrony. Edward J. Yruma - Pacific Crest Securities Great. Thanks so much. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Victor Anthony with Aegis Capital. Victor Anthony - Aegis Capital Corp. One for Mike, one for Greg. So Mike, of all the, I guess, initiatives that you called out with merchandising programming, I guess new customer acquisition, secondary networks. What would you point to as a primary reason for the improving sales trend in the domestic U.S. business? And Greg, if you just comment, if you can, on the transaction yesterday with Pandora we'd love to hear your thoughts, what you think about out there? Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. I'll interrupt and go first and note that this is not the Liberty Media call, so you're going to have to hold that one till later. Mike? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. So in terms of primary driver, not to dodge the question, but I don't think we could point to any one of those initiatives as being a primary driver. When the business gets tough as it did in the back half, it's usually a confluence of multiple factors and to get it better, we need a confluence of positive factors. So the additional focus on the secondary networks certainly helped with growth. But all the work to just diversify product assortments keep moving to what was working in the business, adding more energy and excitement in the programming, every one of those elements, I think, contributed to the results. So, I do feel good that we've got a team that's kind of executing well and working on multiple initiatives in what continues to be a challenged retail environment to win in the marketplace. And I think we'll kind to see that story continue. Victor Anthony - Aegis Capital Corp. And if I could just ask a follow-up in terms of just looking forward in terms of country launches. Could you give us an update on how you think about expanding internationally? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Yeah. At this point, we're not actively focused on international expansion. Our priority is, we like to see the French business get stronger, and we are continuing to work on the China business as well. So we are open-minded about international expansion and we have a team that's kind of always looking at opportunities. And so if a really attractive opportunity emerged, we might jump on it. But at this point, I would say our emphasis has shifted more towards what we're seeing as the strong impact of investing in these secondary networks, which we've talked a lot about in the U.S., but we're also investing in secondary networks in Germany and the UK. And in some ways we think about those as opening up new markets, same geographic region, but new ways to reach more customers, that feels like it's more leverageable than the next set of international markets to expand into. Victor Anthony - Aegis Capital Corp. Okay. Thank you very much. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Alex Fuhrman with Craig-Hallum Capital. Alex Joseph Fuhrman - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Great to taking my question. I would love for you, if you could size up a little bit for us the magnitude of the improvement in March, just trying to understand some of the comments you made on the last conference call, I think you said that January and February were tracking down roughly 3.5%. And then considering the impact of the leap year on top of that, it seems like March would have shown some pretty solid growth. So just want to make sure we're doing that math correctly. And then as we think about how Easter progressed, can you just give us a sense of how important, or I should say, April, can you give us a sense of how important Easter is to the month of April and if that caused any sort of a shift with Easter being later in the quarter this year? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Alex, I appreciate the question. I don't want to get into too much detail on kind of the sequential trends, because there's so much volatility in our programming schedule. You mentioned the Easter shift, which really makes both March and April not comparable to the prior year. So I would say – I would probably generally characterize it as we felt that improving trend as more and more of initiatives we put into place started to get traction, but also we're trying to draw some straight line there, because there are lots of other factors that play into that in the programming calendar. And I'll probably kind of shy away from any comments about the current quarter. April is not hugely meaningful to the business, but it has some impact. But I don't want to get into kind of details about Q2 at this point. Alex Joseph Fuhrman - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC Sure. That makes sense, Mike. And then curious to see, you talked about some of the equivalent of the TSVs being launch on QVC2 and the beauty channel. Do you feel looking out into the back half of the year? Are there enough TSVs to go around? I mean, could you have a full, robust complement of beauty and QVC2, TSVs, and did you feel that won't impact or might that have some impact on what you're able to show as your top deal a day on the primary channel? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. It's something that we're watching very carefully and kind of learning as we go. I think it's all about relative expectations. So certainly, we don't expect these secondary channel promotions to be anywhere near the magnitude of the TSV. So, I think of these three very special deals, the TSV will always be the most special, it's certainly where we'll get majority of the volume. And we're going to always kind of reserve our biggest opportunities for that channel. But there's also an opportunity to be creative with the big deals and the beauty's deals. Doing things on those channels that might not make sense on the main channel, might not be a mass enough audience or mass enough idea, but it still be very attractive. So, I think it opens up opportunities to experiment with different kinds of daily deals that kind of earn a spot on the main channel. So, I think we have a lot of opportunities to expand that program before we really risk cannibalizing the TSV. Alex Joseph Fuhrman - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC That's helpful. Thank you, Mike. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky with Bank of America. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hi, good morning, thank you for taking my call. I was just wondering, in terms of the balance sheet, pre and post GCI, how you're thinking about capital priorities, just given the fact that you're taking on eventually the deferred tax liability from the debentures? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. So, I'll take the first shot at that, and Mark or Mike certainly can add. We are going to provide both immediate liquidity for QVC Group through the transference of cash, and as we've noted, assets which are salable and future tax benefits. So yes, there is a deferred liability out there, but it is 29, 30, 31, and in the interim, substantially increasing cash flows. And frankly, we'll continue to evaluate whether we're going to use that for debt reduction or incremental approaches or if we find something attractive to invest in. But I would note that our first priority has been maintaining a stable sort of capital structure and using incremental cash flows to share repurchase, and I don't expect that to change. Guys, Mark or Mike, do you want to add anything? No. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Nothing else. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. Great. Heather N. Balsky - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Okay. Great, thanks. Operator Your next question is from the line of Tom Forte with Maxim Group. Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, Mike, congrats on the improving trends at QVC. The question I has for Mike, on consumer electronics, is connected home a big enough category to offset the transition to tablet from desktop/laptop and kind of a lackluster TV? Or is that going to be just a continued challenging category until you see something either on the tablet or TV side? Thanks. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thanks, Tom. I would say, today, connected home is not big enough to fill in for a declining computer and tablet business. So, I would say, we're cautious in the outlook for consumer electronics. As I mentioned, we did further pullback airtime in the quarter and saw improved sales per minute as a result, but not kind of absolute growth. I would hope that we are past the worst of the pressure, because we have now kind of anniversaried a very large computer and tablet business. And we've seen some innovations in some segments, the all-in-ones and 2-in-1s, as I mentioned. So what I would hope is, as we've seen some steep declines in computer and tablet, those start to just sort of naturally moderate. And there're some innovations in some sub-segments of those categories, and then we'll start to see some growth for connected home. But whether all that adds up to top-line growth in consumer electronics, we'll have to see. We're not necessarily banking on that and believe we have to have other vehicles for growth. Tom Forte - Maxim Group LLC Thanks, Mike. Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Thank you. Operator Your next question is from the line of James Ratcliffe with Evercore-ISI. James Ratcliffe - Evercore-ISI Morning. Thanks for taking the question. I've two on the Ventures side, if I could. First of all, when you – it looks like you will have about $1.2 billion or $1. 3 billion in cash in the FTD and other stakes once you're done. How much cash does GCI actually need, and how much is going to be sort of available potentially for other purposes within that business? And secondly, are there benefits to GCI from being a, call it, cousin of Charter effectively sort of within the Liberty family, even though they're not part of the same corporate unit? Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. So on the first point, GCI will be a free cash flow generator, not consumer. So we anticipate having shared – cash available for other purposes. And candidly, we're bullish on Charter. And if we continue to trade at a discount, GCI at a discount to – and the GCI Liberty complex at a discount to Broadband, and therefore, even bigger discount to Charter, that's only opportunity. Whether we can achieve something, because we're part of a Charter family, we'll have to work on that. There is no direct ownership from Charter, so that is probably a second-order opportunity, not a first-order one. But certainly, we're cognizant of the fact that Charter runs a video business with much higher margins opportunity compared to smaller cable operators, like GCI. James Ratcliffe - Evercore-ISI And just a follow-up. Are there any limits other than tax considerations around the monetization of the LendingTree or FTD effects? Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. No. I don't – I would say not – it's slightly more complicated, but no – in general, no. James Ratcliffe - Evercore-ISI Thank you. Operator Your next question is from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Just a question for Mr. Maffei. For many, many years, anytime the investment community asked you about potentially buying a portion of HSNi that you don't own, you've always pointed investors towards the multiple disparity between Q and H. For some reason, the buy side feels like your narrative has sort of changed on that or maybe less sensitive to that metric than you've been in the past. Is that true? Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. No. My philosophy is exactly the same. We weigh the multiple, in particular, I'd note, not just the EBITDA multiple, but the free cash flow multiple, because the EBITDA multiples have converged, but the free cash flow multiples are still fairly far apart. We weigh those, and clearly then we expect there would be some synergy values, but historically, we have found, in our judgment, that they are not sufficient, the synergies to overcome that multiple differential. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Okay. Very helpful. Thanks. Gregory B. Maffei - Liberty Interactive Corp. Always evaluate it on that basis. Jason Boisvert Bazinet - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Thank you. Operator The next question is from the line of Barton Crockett with FBR Capital Markets. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to focus a little bit more on the encouraging trend at QVC in the U.S. And if we do kind of a two-year stack on the ex-leap day kind of growth, and we are up 3%. And I know you don't really want to guide, but just to kind of push a little bit on that or even talk about initial quarter trends. But just to push a little bit on that, is there any reason that we shouldn't think that that two-year stack can persist for the balance of the year. Was there anything unusual in the first quarter that seems like it wouldn't be repeatable as we go through the year? Michael A. George - QVC, Inc. Bart, I don't think there's anything especially unusual in the first quarter. So to your point, we do feel good about the two-year stack and that would suggest opportunity in the back half. But we have to get there and get to the back half to see it. So as you know, Q1 and Q2 were roughly similar in year-over-year growth rates a year ago. Q2 was more volatile, really strong growth in tough comps in April-May, and then big erosion in June, but the overall quarter kind of ended up similar to Q1. And then we get obviously to much easier comps in the back half. So once we get to the back half and start to lap those easier comps, I would certainly hope that that pretends very well for the business. We certainly feel very good about the initiatives we're taking, but not just hope, but to actually have a series of programs that will drive growth. But beyond that, I don't want to speculate until we get there and start to earn on the results. Barton Crockett - FBR Capital Markets & Co. Okay. And just to understand this a little bit more clearly, is the Easter shift helpful for the second quarter and a headwind for the first quarter or the inverse of that or does it not even really matter?

With that, let me turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Len Schleifer. Len? Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thanks, Manisha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call and webcast today. The first quarter of 2017 was an eventful and significant quarter. Dupixent, our breakthrough drug for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adults, received regulatory approval in the United States and the launch is underway. This marked the first of two anticipated FDA approvals in 2017, the second being for sarilumab, also now known as Kevzara, where we have been granted an FDA action or PDUFA date of May 22. Before we get into the details of our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to remind everyone of two important priorities at Regeneron. At the core, we have always been a company that is driven by science, and committed to bringing important new drugs to patients in need. These priorities are directly responsible for the robust pipeline that we have today, with five FDA approved drugs and 16 product candidates in various stages of clinical development, all of which have come out of Regeneron labs. George will provide more details on pipeline progress. As we advance as a company, the commercial aspects of our business is growing in importance as well. This year, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, are laser-focused on ensuring that the ongoing Dupixent launch is successful. While it is too early for us to provide you with sales updates, I am pleased to share with you that about five weeks into the launch of Dupixent, things are continuing to go well. We are pleased with the interest and reception from both patients and physicians. Just last week you heard from our partner, Sanofi, that about four weeks into the launch, more than 2,500 prescriptions for new patients for Dupixent had been written. I\'m happy to inform you to-date that over 3,500 new prescriptions have been written for Dupixent, which translates into over 900 prescriptions written in the past week. We are also pleased with the reaction from the payers on our responsible approach to pricing to date. We continue to work hard to ensure that eligible patients have access to the drug, and we are pleased with the coverage and utilization management criteria that have been put in place thus far. Bob Terifay will provide additional details. While atopic dermatitis in adults is our first indication, we are also investigating the use of Dupixent in several other indications and age groups, ranging from what we think could be a near term opportunity in asthma to other indications such as nasal polyps and eosinophilic esophagitis. Just today, we reported our Phase 2 proof-of-concept study in eosinophilic esophagitis was positive. If we can get approvals for these additional indications, we expect to be in launch mode with Dupixent for many years to come. Maintaining our leadership position with EYLEA as the market-leading branded anti-VEGF drug continues to be a key focus. With our first regulatory approval in wet age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD, the EYLEA business was initially more concentrated towards the elderly, the majority of whom are Medicare patients. But with subsequent approvals in indications such as diabetic macular edema or DME and diabetic retinopathy in DME and retinal vein occlusion, we have diversified to patient groups where there is less reliance on Medicare. We continue to support the ongoing launch of Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody, for lowering LDL cholesterol. We expect our 18,000-patient cardiovascular outcome study to be completed towards the end of the year with data in early 2018. On the U.S. patent litigation, we and our collaborator, Sanofi, have been granted an oral argument date of June 6, 2017 at the Court Of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Based on this timing, we could get a decision on the appeal before the end of the year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to George. George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thank you, Len, and a very good morning to everyone who has joined us today. On the call today, I would like to focus on our ongoing clinical development program for dupilumab, review some important data on the long-term use of EYLEA, share some updates on our immuno-oncology program, as well as the progress of the rest of our pipeline. I\'d like to begin with the approval of Dupixent, our IL-4/IL-13 blocker for the treatment of moderate to severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable. This approval is the culmination of a scientific quest that has been decades in the making. While Bob Terifay will address the ongoing launch of Dupixent in greater detail, I would like to focus on the progress that we are making in the clinic with dupilumab in various other indications. Asthma is an important late-stage opportunity where we are investigating in the use of dupilumab. Despite the recent approval of drugs from the IL-5 inhibitor class in what has been characterized as the allergic patient population, we believe there is an unmet medical need for these patients for a drug that can markedly improve lung function, as well as provide further protection against exacerbations. In addition, there is a need for drugs that will show efficacy in a wider patient population across all allergic classifications. Based on results from our Phase 2B pivotal study in asthma, where we showed robust improvements in both lung function as measured by FEV1 and reductions in exacerbations, in all patients regardless of their allergic classification, we believe that dupilumab has the potential, if approved, to fill these needs. Our second pivotal study in the adult asthma indication, the LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST study in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma is fully enrolled and we continue to expect top line data later this year. We believe these data have the potential to confirm the broad efficacy we observed in the first pivotal study. If these data are positive, we expect to complete a regulatory submission in the United States in the fourth quarter of this year. We also recently started enrolling patients in the Phase 3 study of dupilumab in pediatric asthma patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years in the second quarter of 2017. We\'re also evaluating dupilumab in pediatric atopic dermatitis, where there is a high unmet need, and we were again granted breakthrough status by the FDA. Positive data from the open label Phase 2A trial in patients 6 to 17 years old with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis were recently presented at the American Academy of Dermatology Conference in March. The safety and efficacy data from this trial were very encouraging. We have initiated a Phase 3 study of dupilumab in adolescents between the ages of 12 to 17. We expect to initiate in the second quarter of 2017 a second Phase 3 trial in pediatric patients between the ages of 6 and 11 years. We\'re also investigating dupilumab in a third clinical setting, which is the treatment of patients with nasal polyps. Following up on earlier positive data from our Phase 2 study in this population, we now have two separate Phase 3 studies that are currently enrolling patients. As Len mentioned, we recently obtained positive results in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study of dupilumab in a fourth important clinical setting, which is in patients with active moderate to severe eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammation of the esophagus and one of the major causes of dysphasia or difficulty in swallowing. In this Phase 2 study, we observed clinically meaningful efficacy for dupilumab, as well as profound histologic and endoscopic improvement, together with a safety profile consistent with our previous clinical experience. Detailed data from this study will be presented in an upcoming medical conference. While eosinophilic esophagitis can be debilitating in adults, it is especially concerning in the pediatric population, where it can be a cause of failure to thrive, and this could potentially be an area of future clinical investigation for dupilumab. It is believed that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergies, further supporting the rationale of exploring the efficacy of dupilumab in patients suffering from severe specific food allergies. In the second half of 2017, we intend to initiate a Phase 2 study of dupilumab in patients with specific food allergy. The positive data for dupilumab across the four allergic or atopic conditions we have investigated to date – that is atopic dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps, and now eosinophilic esophagitis – is consistent with our long-standing hypothesis that these allergic conditions reflect the same fundamental disease process triggered by overactivity of the IL-4/IL-13 axis. This unifying hypothesis suggests that the differences between these conditions largely reflects how overactivity of IL-4/IL-13 pathway manifests differently in different tissues. For example, overactivity of IL-4 and IL-13 in the skin triggers atopic dermatitis. In the lower airway, it results in asthma. In the upper GI tract, it results in eosinophilic esophagitis. Unfortunately for many patients, IL-4/IL-13-driven allergies can manifest in multiple sites at the same time. Since dupilumab inhibits the key driver of this pathway in all these settings, we believe that it can represent a mechanism-based approach to treat the root cause of these allergic conditions rather than each individual indication on a separate basis. This represents a fundamentally new way to think of, group and treat diseases previously and otherwise thought of as disparate and requiring distinct therapies – that is mechanism-based treatment directed not by a disease organ-specific manifestations, but by the disease\'s fundamental cause and mechanism. We\'re also encouraged by the safety profile that we have observed thus far for dupilumab in these settings. I\'d like to remind you that the current regulatory framework does not allow for a mechanism-based approach to treatment, but rather an indication-based approach. We are very interested in discussing this type of mechanism-based approach for treating allergic or atopic disease with the regulatory authorities while we continue to pursue more conventional approval strategies. Turning now to Kevzara, our IL-6 receptor antibody for rheumatoid arthritis. As Len mentioned, we anticipate a regulatory decision in the United States, where we\'ve been granted an FDA action date of May 22. In April of 2017, the European Medicines Agency\'s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP adopted a positive opinion for Kevzara for the treatment of moderate to severe RA in adults. We expect a potential approval in Europe for Kevzara in the second quarter of 2017. We have also made regulatory submissions for Kevzara in Japan. Beyond RA, we are currently enrolling patients in the Phase 2 clinical study of sarilumab for the treatment of polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We\'re also considering investigating the use of sarilumab in other indications. Turning to our other late-stage programs, I\'d like to begin with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we are committed to maintaining our leadership position in bringing important advances to patients with retinal diseases. To that end, we are conducting two Phase 2 studies of EYLEA in combination with nesvacumab, our antibody to Ang2, one in diabetic macular edema or DME and another in neovascular age-related macular degeneration or wet AMD. Both studies are fully enrolled, and we will evaluate efficacy and safety at 36 weeks, which we expect in the second half of this year. In addition, we are also investing in EYLEA as a monotherapy in a Phase 3 study in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without diabetic macular edema. This study, called PANORAMA, continues to enroll patients. I\'d like to spend a few moments focusing on findings from the long-term follow-up of our Phase 3 VIEW 1 study of EYLEA in patients with wet AMD, which were recently published in Ophthalmology Retina. As background, existing long-term data with other anti-VEGF agents, most notably from the government-sponsored CATT study, have shown that early visual gains obtained with anti-VEGF agents were not maintained over time. In fact, by the fifth year, patient had lost, on average, over three letters compared to their original baseline. Over 20% of patients have progressed to become legally blind by year five. It had been postulated that this loss of vision is due to inexorable progression of the disease process itself over time, even in the face of anti-VEGF treatment. Others had raised the theory that the anti-VEGF agents themselves contribute to geographic atrophy over time and thus to the subsequent vision loss. In marked contrast to the CATT study, long-term follow-up data from the VIEW 1 study, where patients who were treated with fixed interval EYLEA dosing and received EYLEA on average every 12 weeks in year 2 and every 8 weeks in year 3 and 4 showed that the vision gains observed at the end of the first year were on average largely maintained at 4 years. These long-term results provide the first evidence that long-term treatment with anti-VEGF agents can maintain vision gains in patients with wet AMD. We think these are very important findings for the field. This data support our longstanding view that regular fixed interval dosing regimens result in substantially better visual outcomes compared to PRN or treat-and-extend dosing regimens, which over time result in suboptimal visual acuity benefits and even in substantial visual loss. We think this is probably true regardless of the anti-VEGF agent being utilized. Although we saw that more than 50% – about 50% of the patients in the second year exploratory treatment phase of our long-term trial received fixed corollary treatment and maintained their vision we are more comfortable that the every two-months regimen is likely to maintain vision over the long term based on larger and long-term experience. With regards to convenience-based regimens such as PRN and treat-and-extend approaches, we think they are lacking in convincing and long-term evidence for their ability to maintain vision over the long-term. With regards to this point, we think that doctors should be strongly cautioning their patients that choosing convenience-based dosing has a high risk of causing permanent vision loss for their patients We think it is important that retinal specialists and public health officials begin to recognize the potential public health crisis that may be resulting from irregular dosing regimens that do not follow the FDA-recommended usage guidelines and that the loss of vision that these protocols may be causing may be needlessly occurring in thousands of patients, leaving many irrevocably legally blind. Moving on to Praluent, our PCSK9 inhibitor antibody for lowering LDL cholesterol. We are pleased to announce that Praluent was recently approved in a 300-milligram once monthly dosing regimen. We expect to report top line data from the 18,000 patient ODYSSEY Outcomes study in the first quarter of 2018. Positive outcome data reported with PCSK9 inhibitors further supports the hypothesis that lowering LDL cholesterol with the PCSK9 inhibitor can reduce cardiovascular risk. We look forward to sharing data from our study in early 2018. In addition to our efforts with Praluent and cardiovascular disease, we are also developing evinacumab, our antibody to Angptl-3 for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or homozygous FH. In March of 2017, we announced that the FDA granted evinacumab Breakthrough Designation Status. Just a few weeks ago, we presented a positive data from a Phase 2 proof of concept study of evinacumab in patients with homozygous FH. This data showed that patients who normally don\'t respond well to statins or to PCSK9 experienced an average reduction of 50% in their LDL cholesterol following two subcutaneous injections of evinacumab with an acceptable safety profile. Our immuno-oncology portfolio continues to progress. Our potentially pivotal study of Regeneron 2810, our PD-1 antibody, continues to enroll patients in the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma study. We look forward to presenting data from our expansion on in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma patients from our Phase 1 trial at an all-abstract session at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, in June. We also expect to initiate clinical studies in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma in 2017. Our second checkpoint inhibitor, REGN3767, an antibody to LAG-3 is also currently in clinical development where we are studying it both in the mono-therapy setting and in combination with our PD1 antibody. As a reminder, we expect additional IO targets to enter development over the next several years. Additionally, our bispecific CD20xCD3 antibody is also currently being studied in the clinic, as well as in mono-therapy and in combination with our PD-1 antibody. Determining the optimal dosage level with these therapies that are activating the immune system is very important as witnessed by some of the toxicities demonstrated in other drug classes such as the CAR-Ts. While the process has been slow, we believe we are nearing dose selection. Also in late-stage development is suptavumab, also known as REGN2222, which is an antibody in development for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. Our Phase 3 study has finished enrolling patients, and we expect to report top line data from this study in the second half of the year. We\'re also advancing our Phase 2 program for fasinumab, our nerve growth factor antibody for pain. Development in other parts of our early-stage pipeline continues to advance. REGN2477, our Activin A antibody is in clinical development for the treatment of the rare disease Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP. We expect to begin a Phase 2 trial in this indication in the second half of 2017. We are also studying REGN2477 in combination with trevogrumab, our antibody to GFD8, in a Phase 1 trial which is fully enrolled. Finally, we also initiated Phase 1 multiple ascending dose trial in asthma with REGN3500, our antibody interleukin-33 for inflammatory diseases, in the first quarter of 2017. I think it\'s important to remind you that all of these programs and all the antibodies in our pipeline are entirely developed and discovered in-house. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I want to take a moment to share my excitement about the first group of Regeneron Science Talent Search winners who were announced in March. Our sponsorship of this storied high school science competition underscores our commitment to fostering the next generation of scientific leaders. After meeting these promising high school students, we feel encouraged that our future is in good hands. With that, let me turn the call over to Bob Terifay. Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thank you, George, and good morning, everyone. First quarter 2017 U.S. net sales of EYLEA or aflibercept were $854 million versus $781 million in the first quarter of 2016. This represents growth of 9% year-over-year. Ex-U.S. net sales of EYLEA were $484 million compared to $419 million in the first quarter of 2016. This represents growth of 16% year-over-year. EYLEA is approved in approximately 100 countries for the treatment of wet AMD and DME. EYLEA continues to be the market-leading product among FDA-approved anti-VEGF agents for all of its approved indications in the United States. U.S. EYLEA net sales in the first quarter were impacted by a slight decrease in distributor or inventory as well as an increase in the gross-to-net margin, which Bob Landry will discuss in more detail. Based on a qualitative market research survey we conducted in the first quarter, EYLEA market share remained consistent at approximately 66% of the FDA-approved anti-VEGF market. Also based on this survey, FDA approved anti-VEGF therapies account for approximately 56% of the overall anti-VEGF market. In term of treatment regimens, as George noted, the variable interval dosing regimens that are often used in the treatment of retinal diseases with the anti-VEGF agents can contribute to inadequate vision improvements and we believe are not optimal for long-term maintenance of visual acuity. We are focused on educating retinal physicians and their patients on the benefits of using dosing regimens supported by evidence-based medicine and approved by the FDA. The recent approval and launch of Dupixent or dupilumab in the United States is the beginning of a new chapter for Regeneron. Dupixent was approved for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis at the end of March. As Len mentioned, the drug is commercially available to patients. Our field force is engaged with and educating the 7,000 or so targeted dermatologists, allergists and immunologists in the United States. The targeted patient population consists of roughly 300,000 patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis who have the greatest need. These are the patients who\'ve exhausted all approved therapies and that failed or are unable to tolerate unapproved use of immunosuppressants. Though it\'s quite early in the launch, we are pleased with what we have seen so far and I\'d like to share with you some of the details of the ongoing launch. Firstly, we believe that the importance of good market access cannot be underestimated. To that end, we were very thoughtful about pricing Dupixent following multiple discussions with key stakeholders. Our goal for access is that utilization management criteria reflect good medical practice, which means that Dupixent should be prescribed by specialists such as dermatologists, allergists and immunologists to patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, who have not responded to maximum topical cortical steroids. We do not believe that requiring patients to take potentially toxic off-label systemic immunosuppressants is appropriate now that Dupixent is approved and available. Two of the largest pharmacy benefits managers or PBMs have provided coverage right from the beginning. Coverage at these two PBMs account for approximately 25% of lives in commercial plans in the United States. We\'ve been actively engaged with additional payers, and based on these conversations, we believe, are well-positioned to receive broad coverage by the end of the year. We hope that these decisions will come early since eligible patients have been waiting for a long time for a new treatment for this debilitating disease. To-date, we estimate that over 1,800 physicians across all 50 states have already written a Dupixent prescription. There have been over 3,500 prescriptions for new patients written for Dupixent as of today. I would like to remind you that this number only represents the prescriptions written by physicians. It is not a reflection of the number of prescriptions that have been dispensed. Writing the prescriptions starts the coverage approval process. We estimate that the coverage decision should take several weeks, so it\'s too early for us to predict how many of these prescriptions will ultimately be approved for insurance coverage and dispensed. However, the early signs are encouraging, and we look forward to updating you during the second quarter. Outside of the United States, to remind everyone, in the fourth quarter 2016, we filed a Marketing Authorization Application or MAA for Dupixent and hope to have European approval by year end. Turning now to Kevzara or sarilumab, our IL-6 receptor antibody for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. We\'ve been granted an FDA action date of May 22nd. We\'ll be co-promoting Kevzara in the United States. Our sales force is on board and is preparing for the anticipated launch. In Europe, Kevzara has received a positive opinion from the CHMP and our collaborator, Sanofi Genzyme, is gearing up for a potential launch in Europe later this year as well. Turning now to Praluent or alirocumab. As reported by Sanofi, net sales in the first quarter were $36 million worldwide with the U.S. accounting for $25 million of the total. I would like to note that there was an impact in the marketplace from the injunction ruling against us in the first quarter of 2017, which was eventually stayed pending appeal. We are pleased to announce the Praluent was recently approved in a 300-milligram once monthly dosing regimen. We continue to be disappointed by the uptake of the PCSK9 inhibitor class, but remain optimistic given the recent positive Outcomes data for this class and our own Outcomes data are expected in early 2018, which if positive could have an impact on demand. We remain committed to our efforts to improve Praluent access and bring this important product to more patients who can benefit. With that, let me turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Bob Landry. Robert E. Landry - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everyone. During today\'s call, I\'ll discuss our first quarter 2017 financial performance and highlight changes to a few of our full-year 2017 guidance line items. In the first quarter of 2017, we earned $2.92 per diluted share from non-GAAP net income of $337 million. This represents a year-over-year increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS and net income of 22% and 23%, respectively. I\'d like to remind everyone that these growth numbers are based upon revised first quarter 2016 non-GAAP net income and EPS results relating to the company\'s adaption of Accounting Standard Update 2016-09 in the second quarter of 2016. This accounting standard requires companies to recognize excess tax benefits in connection with employee exercises of stock options in the income statement. You can access these revised numbers and further information in our Form 10-Q filed earlier this morning. Regeneron\'s first quarter 2016 and 2017 non-GAAP net income excludes non-cash share-based compensation expense and includes the income tax effect of non-GAAP reconciling items. A full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP earnings is set forth in our earnings release. Total revenues in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.3 billion, which represented year-over-year growth of 10% over the first quarter of 2016. Net product sale were $858 million in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $784 million in the first quarter of 2016. EYLEA net product sales in the United States were $854 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $781 million in the first quarter of 2016, which represents an increase of 9%. For the full year 2017, we reaffirm our U.S. EYLEA net sales guidance of year-over-year single-digit percentage growth. During the first quarter of 2017, EYLEA experienced a slight drawdown in U.S. distributor inventory levels yet remained within our normal one- to two-week targeted range. Additionally, we experienced an increase in our EYLEA gross to net percentage as a result of two factors. First, earlier this year, we started offering a discount to all offices regardless of volume for competitive reasons. And, second, there\'s been a small increase in the number of Medicaid patients being treated with EYLEA. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, which are recorded by our collaborator Bayer, were $484 million in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to $419 million in the first quarter of 2016, representing a 16% increase on a reported basis. On an operational basis or constant currency basis, sales increased approximately 19%. In the first quarter of 2017, Regeneron recognized $175 million from our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the United States. Total Bayer collaboration revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $194 million. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $210 million for the first quarter of 2017. The Sanofi collaboration revenue line item primarily consists of reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred R&D expenses, reimbursement of Regeneron-incurred commercialization-related expenses, and our share of profits or losses in connection with the commercialization of antibodies. In the first quarter 2017, our share of losses in connection with the commercialization of Praluent, Dupixent, and Kevzara was $108 million. This can be found in Table 4 of our earnings release. This loss represents increased spending related to the Dupixent and Kevzara launches, while we continue to proactively monitor and manage our investment in the global commercialization of Praluent. Netted within these losses were the global sales of Praluent as recognized by our partner Sanofi, which for the first quarter of 2017 were $36 million. The U.S. net sales of Praluent in the first quarter 2017 were clearly impacted from the news regarding the January 5, 2017, issuance of the permanent injunction prohibiting the commercialization of Praluent in the United States, which was subsequently stayed pending appeal. In the first quarter of 2017, other revenue increased significantly as compared to the first quarter of 2016. This increase was primarily due to reimbursements of research and development costs in connection with our collaboration agreement with Teva, which was entered into in September 2016. You can find a summary of the components of other revenue in the MD&A section of our 10-Q. Turning now to expenses, non-GAAP R&D expenses were $434 million for the first quarter of 2017. Our non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D expense, which is calculated as the total non-GAAP R&D expense less R&D reimbursements from our collaborators, was $189 million in the first quarter of 2017. Our press release includes all the information that is required to calculate unreimbursed non-GAAP R&D expense. For 2017, we\'d like to reiterate our previously provided guidance for non-GAAP unreimbursed R&D to be in the range of $950 million to $1.025 billion. Non-GAAP SG&A expense was $243 million for the first quarter of 2017. We are tightening and lowering our full-year 2017 guidance for non-GAAP SG&A to $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion from our previous guidance range of $1.175 billion to $1.25 billion. Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses, a line item found within Sanofi collaboration revenue, was $74 million for the first quarter of 2017. We are lowering and tightening our full year 2017 guidance of Sanofi reimbursement of Regeneron commercialization-related expenses to be in the range of $385 million to $425 million, from $400 million to $450 million. Before shifting to taxes, I would also like to note that operating cost related to our Limerick manufacturing facility that have not been capitalized were recognized in cost of goods sold and, therefore, had a negative impact on our first quarter 2017 gross margin as compared to the third and fourth quarters of 2016. Turning now to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter 2017 was approximately 42% as compared to approximately 45% for the first quarter of 2016, which as stated earlier has been revised for the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-09. For the full year 2017, we continue to guide our effective tax rate to be in the range of 32% to 38%. This guidance includes an estimate of the full year tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation. As stated on previous calls, there will be volatility in our effective tax rate quarter to quarter since the tax benefits of stock-based compensation can only be included based on actual exercises in the quarter. We expect the majority of our stock-based compensation tax benefits to be recognized in the latter part of the year as we have a large number of stock options that vest or expire in the fourth quarter. From a cash flow and balance sheet perspective, we ended the first quarter of 2017 with cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion. Our capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2017 were $50 million. We are tightening and lowering our full year 2017 capital expenditure guidance to be in the range of $300 million to $350 million from our previous guidance range of $375 million to $425 million. We note that this represents a significantly lower capital spend than the previous two years as we are nearing completion of a few major capital projects including our drug substance manufacturing facility in Limerick, Ireland. Also, we finalized the refinancing related to our Tarrytown headquarters in March 2017. Further details can be found on our website in the 8-K filed in association with this transaction or in our most recent 10-Q that was filed earlier this morning. With that, I\'d like to turn the call back to Manisha. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thank you, Bob. Sylvia, we\'d now like to open the line for Q&A. In the interest of time, we\'d like to request that you limit yourself to one question. We will be available in the office after the call for a follow-up Q&A. Question-and-Answer Session Operator Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question comes from Geoff Porges from Leerink Partners. Geoffrey C. Porges - Leerink Partners LLC Thanks very much for taking the question and congratulations on all the progress. And Len, don\'t take this the wrong way, but congratulations on the cash flow and filing the Q account. I wanted to ask, George, just a few questions – related questions on the pipeline. Looking through the Q this morning, there\'s no mention of your C5 antibody nor of your CD3 biospecific. Could you jus comment on the status of those programs? And then, on the ODYSSEY Outcomes study, given the timing that you\'ve provided to us, can you give us a sense of what you estimate the median duration of exposure will be in the study and what effect that might have on the likely effect size given the offset of the lower dosing that you may have with some patients? George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. A lot of questions in there. First, we did actually comment on the CD20 by CD3 biospecific that it\'s moving along, that basically we\'ve spent a lot of time because as obviously, you\'ve all noticed that there have been concerns with similar types of agents, as well as the CAR-T approaches in terms of really getting the right dose and avoiding very dangerous toxicity. So, we\'ve been very careful about dose selection in that program, and we\'re hoping very close to be – to the point where we can initiate larger trials. In terms of our C5 antibody, I don\'t know how much we\'ve said publicly about it, but I guess we\'ve said that we will be in the clinic with it this year and I\'m sorry I didn\'t make any references. That was just an oversight on my part. In terms of our Outcomes study, I have to say there are so many differences between our design and the four-year design that I think it\'s almost impossible to try to model it and figure out are the results going to be substantially different. I think that the four-year data pretty strongly show that its results are very consistent with the sort of benefits that, when obtained in terms of cardiovascular outcomes with the proportional LDL lowering, and that\'s pretty much exactly what we hope to show, that we\'re pretty much on the same sort of curve as the statins and now the first results that are coming out of the PCSK9 class. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator, next question, please. Operator Our following question comes from Chris Raymond from Raymond James. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Hey. Thanks. Question on Dupixent. So, according to some of our market checks, it looks like the breakdown among patients by age is that roughly half are adults, you\'ve got maybe 20% adolescents, but then there\'s another maybe sort of 33% or 34% that are treated by docs today that are under 12. I know you guys have talked about the clinical path for kids 6 to 12 but, at least according to our data anyway, derms today have a sizable patient load under 6, and there\'s probably many more who haven\'t made their way to a derm. So, can you maybe talk about the potential to get at that market of kids under 6? Like, for example, some of our data says that maybe as much as 12% or so of patient load are actually even under 2. So, what\'s the setup, I guess, there for treating kids younger? Thanks. George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. You are absolutely right that a lot of these allergic diseases, it\'s not only atopic dermatitis, but eosinophilic esophagitis and so forth and so on, unfortunately, afflict the very young. There\'s a very deliberate process that we work with with regulatory authorities to progress to the youngest in our population because we all feel that we have to be very careful, and we\'re working very closely with the FDA to follow along those guidelines to be able to bring this treatment down the line to the youngest of patients who really need it. But as you said, there is a very important unmet need in these populations for all sorts of allergic diseases. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. One thing, just to amplify what George said, is that the FDA clearly recognizes it. They had an advisory group, and they in fact pushed us to start on younger populations even sooner than one might normally in the development program. So, I think we get it. The agency gets it. They\'ve granted us I think breakthrough status for – I can\'t remember which age group, maybe – Manisha, do you remember? Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 12 to 17. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 12 to 17. So, I mean, I think everybody gets it, and we\'ve got good early data, and as George said, we\'re sort of doing this logically, and trying to move to where that need is. Of course, the chronocity of treatment from a commercial point of view, once you make it to adulthood and you have the disease, we should be clear that this is – we don\'t view this as treating an episodic disease. These people have disease chronically and will need chronic treatment, which may be different than children who can possibly outgrow this. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. So, should we see a trial then start maybe for kids under six at some point? I guess that\'s the key question. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yes. You will see us moving towards younger age groups steadily. Christopher Raymond - Raymond James & Associates, Inc. Thank you. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Next question, please? Operator Our following question comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the launch of Dupixent. I have one question on EYLEA. It seems that you reported pretty strong numbers for EYLEA sales in the U.S. and Roche reported strong numbers for Lucentis. So does that mean the market is growing at a higher rate this year or are the branded medicines taking share from off-label Avastin? And then, maybe for George, a quick question on you PD-1 trial for non-small cell lung cancer. Given there\'s a debate around PD-L1 levels, I was wondering if you can comment how do you plan to design that trial in terms of stratification of PD-L1 expression levels? And do you see any differentiation from your PD-1 and the other marketed bio drugs? Thank you. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Okay. So let\'s take that – Ying, thanks – in two parts. First, Bob can address what he thinks the market size is overall for anti-VEGF therapy, and what the branded versus non-branded split is. And then George can deal with your question on lung cancer and PD-1. Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. I think it\'s – as we mentioned, the overall branded anti-VEGF market year-over-year grew by 9%, which is consistent with what we saw in our growth. So, you can assume that both products had approximately 9% growth. We did mention that in terms of what portion of the market is the branded market, it\'s approximately 65%. So... Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Which hasn\'t really changed... Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ... hasn\'t changed. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ...so the market itself seems to be growing, although our figures showed a slight inventory drawdown, and we don\'t know well-enough what happened with Lucentis and whether there was some destocking at the end of last quarter, and then restocking with their new formulation or not. So, to get more granularity on that, Ying, you\'ll have to pester Roche. George? George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. About PD-1 and PD-L1 levels and so forth, I don\'t think there is actually that much of a controversy. I think that all the data shows that in most cases a higher PDL expression correlates with better responses. The controversy I think that you\'re referring to has to do with the fact that the first line lung study from Merck with KEYTRUDA was very impressively positive whereas the very similar population studied with the BMS drug was not. And this did not really seem to be dependent on the PDL levels. People are really working hard to understand why the Bristol drug showed very disappointing results in that study. Our goal is to show that our drug is very effective in the various lung cancer indications and we\'re designing, we hope and we believe robust studies to demonstrate that. And we are, I believe, going to be announcing that we\'re going to be – when we initiate these studies in the very, very near future. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Good. Next question. Operator Our following question comes from Ronny Gal from Bernstein. Aaron Gal - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Question for Bob, could you contrast for us a little bit the cost of launching Praluent versus Kevzara and Dupixent? Essentially, when you think about the magnitude of cost to launch those two drugs, how do they differ? And second, if we think about the international operations of Praluent, roughly when should we expect them to breakeven? Essentially, what revenue do you need internationally to breakeven on that product? Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. I\'ll talk in generalities. I\'m not going to get into any specifics on the financials, but what I can say is there is a major difference between Dupixent and Praluent in terms of the targeted audiences. Praluent is competing in the hypercholesterolemia market. That is a condition that\'s primarily treated by primary care physicians, but also was treated by a large group of cardiologists and lipidologists. So, in terms of the effort on Praluent, one has to go broad to be able to get to the large physician audience. In terms of Dupixent, as we mentioned in the United States, we\'re targeting about 7,000 specialists. So, the effort is more limited in terms of who you have to call on and what types of support you have to give to those patients. In terms of ex U.S., it\'s premature to talk about breakeven. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. And just to reiterate what Bob said, I think if you do the math, we\'ve hit about – in the neighborhood of about 25% of the doctors we targeted have actually written a prescription, which is really pretty good at this stage of the launch. Next question? Operator Our following question comes from Carter Gould from UBS. Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC Good morning, guys. Congrats on all the progress with Dupixent. I got one for George or Len on Regeneron 2222. The PR mentioned enrollment was 1,200 but I think you\'ve been targeting 1,500-plus patients. Does this impact your (48:41) for the primary endpoint or change how we should be thinking about the likelihood of hitting on one-time-a-season dosing? And I guess if anyone wanted to comment on the competitiveness of this program given Sanofi\'s distributor (48:52) program and subsequent decision to partner with MedImmune, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. I\'ll comment on the latter, and George can comment on the former. The decisions that people make aren\'t always the best ones, and we love our partnership with Sanofi, but remember they are the ones that turned back EYLEA. So we\'ll see them in the marketplace. And we think we have a very good entry, and we love the friendly competition with really good partners. George can get more into the specifics. George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Well, as you know, the power of the study is more dependent on events rather than numbers of patients that actually enrolled. We feel, though, there\'s always concerns, we feel that we\'re adequately powered, and we\'re hoping that the study will meet its expectations. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator, next question, please. Operator Our following question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe – George, I was intrigued by your comments on the long-term EYLEA VIEW data and the importance of adhering to the approved dosing interval. Do you think that proposition would also apply to Novartis\' RTH, recognizing we don\'t have the Phase 3 data yet? But as you think what they\'re trying to accomplish with their drug, maybe help us think about the importance of longer-term data? Thank you. George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. I think it will be a very long time before one has the long-term data with a new agent to be able to say whether or not it could possibly not only cause initial visual gains but maintain them, which is, I think, more important over the four- and five-year time intervals. Right now, we have the only such study that shows that, and the only such data. I think that the field has been going in the wrong direction focusing on convenience, okay, as opposed to focusing on vision. We all know, we all cherish our vision. There\'s nothing more important than maintaining our vision, and we think that there\'s been an over-focus on convenience as opposed to on bringing back – these drugs have the ability to give back vision, and we have now shown that there\'s at least one drug with one regimen or an assorted regimen that has the ability to maintain this over the long term. And I think that we all have to focus on that and less on trying to save an injection or two per year, which is at most what all of these non-medicine-based approaches have been doing. I think this is really important for the field, and we hope, as Bob says, that doctors can be educated about this and stop experimenting on their patients and instead follow the FDA guidelines. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator, next question, please. Operator Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress over the quarter. I just had one on EoE. Can you talk maybe about the potential market size and thoughts on endpoints? I know there\'s been some conversions in public domains around the FDA discussing endpoints. Thanks. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. So, in terms of market size, this is very difficult to ascertain. We know that the market size quote-unquote is "increasing." What we don\'t know whether that\'s because there\'s more patients being diagnosed or it\'s just tracking the general increase in allergic diseases. So we remind you that there\'s a strong set of evidence to indicate that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergy. And so, as an allergy, we\'re seeing lots of these increase. The actual numbers, we just don\'t feel we have a good handle on the number of patients. If Bob wants to give a shot at it, that would be great. In terms of endpoints, we saw clear results, as George mentioned, both on the patient-reported outcomes as well as the hard anatomic. In some cases in the past, for example, in ulcer disease or erosive esophagitis, FDA has used endpoints such as healing, actually, by endoscopy measured. We have not had the conversation yet with the agency about these data. They\'re very new to us, so we will do that and then sort of let you know what it\'s going to take from an approval perspective. Bob, you have... Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. Well, I think Len really nailed the situation with EoE. It is a disease that has generally been underdiagnosed. The current estimate in the U.S. among adults is somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000, but the true instance could be higher based upon underdiagnosis. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Okay. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Next question, please. Operator Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on Dupi as well and kind of how you\'re thinking about the dynamics of a bolus of severe atopic dermatitis patients for Dupixent as we see these early trends and think about the launch going forward. 1,000 scripts written per week is obviously quite an encouraging number but, one, obviously, we can\'t expect to go on forever. So, how much pent-up demand do you see out there now that you\'re in the field? Thanks. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yes. So, that\'s a very, also a very difficult question to get a hard answer on. When you talk to some doctors, they\'ll tell you, well, they had a list of patients that they were going to bring in. When you talk to other doctors, they\'ll tell you that they\'re not – the patients are just sort of showing up and they\'re incident patients which they are constantly seeing in their practice and that patients are aware of the product and want to discuss it with their doctors. How long this goes on? Well, I don\'t know, and we don\'t have enough information to see what the trends are. Have we peaked because of a bolus? Are we increasing still? Are we decreasing? Really too early to tell you. We do know that we\'re focusing on in the 100,000 to 200,000-patient range who are the most difficult to treat. I think with any new drug class, some of it is also going to be dependent upon the doctors\' reaction. The great data that I think we have in our label encourages doctors to try the product. But it will take individual experience and successes with individual patients for them to continue to use it. And so far, we even have heard some early anecdotes on that line as well. So, bottom line is we just don\'t have enough information to guide you, we\'d like to know ourselves. And I think anybody\'s guess at this point is as good as anybody else. Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. I think Len makes an important point. There are patients in need of this important therapy and our job beyond this initial bolus is really to educate physicians and patients on the fact that there is now something that could help these patients. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We do want to reach out and we\'ll reach out appropriately to patients directly because we believe, as Bob was just suggesting, that there are patients who have dropped out of the medical system because they\'ve been to so many different doctors with so many different regimens and nothing has helped them that making them aware that there is something new is an important part of our effort. Next question. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator. In the essence of time, we have one last question. After that, we will be in our office to take additional follow-up questions and our apologies to those who are in queue and who didn\'t get a chance to ask their questions. Operator Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for letting me take the – I have a question. We just noticed actually slightly different take on just on your operating expenditures you\'ve managed your P&L very well this quarter. It looks like, on just a straight run rate into the end of the year, you would actually come below your guidance and with just 110 million shares outstanding, that\'s not trivial. Just any thoughts on the progression of operating expenditures and how you\'re thinking of managing it with the Kevzara launch and all the other activities? Thank you. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. You\'re right in terms of the guidance that we\'ve set for the full year and where we are for the first quarter. As you can imagine, we do obviously spend a lot of time and effort in terms of forecasting where we\'re going to come out on a by-quarter basis, and the quarters are not always consistent. We are going to be in kind of full bloom in the second quarter when we get hopefully our PDUFA approval with Kevzara, and we\'ll have our full strength out there in the marketplace. And again, we do expect higher expenditures with regards to SG&A and with unreimbursed R&D in the second half of 2017. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thank you, operator.

We feel, though, there\'s always concerns, we feel that we\'re adequately powered, and we\'re hoping that the study will meet its expectations. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator, next question, please. Operator Our following question comes from Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Terence Flynn - Goldman Sachs & Co. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe – George, I was intrigued by your comments on the long-term EYLEA VIEW data and the importance of adhering to the approved dosing interval. Do you think that proposition would also apply to Novartis\' RTH, recognizing we don\'t have the Phase 3 data yet? But as you think what they\'re trying to accomplish with their drug, maybe help us think about the importance of longer-term data? Thank you. George D. Yancopoulos - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. I think it will be a very long time before one has the long-term data with a new agent to be able to say whether or not it could possibly not only cause initial visual gains but maintain them, which is, I think, more important over the four- and five-year time intervals. Right now, we have the only such study that shows that, and the only such data. I think that the field has been going in the wrong direction focusing on convenience, okay, as opposed to focusing on vision. We all know, we all cherish our vision. There\'s nothing more important than maintaining our vision, and we think that there\'s been an over-focus on convenience as opposed to on bringing back – these drugs have the ability to give back vision, and we have now shown that there\'s at least one drug with one regimen or an assorted regimen that has the ability to maintain this over the long term. And I think that we all have to focus on that and less on trying to save an injection or two per year, which is at most what all of these non-medicine-based approaches have been doing. I think this is really important for the field, and we hope, as Bob says, that doctors can be educated about this and stop experimenting on their patients and instead follow the FDA guidelines. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator, next question, please. Operator Our next question comes from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities ( USA ) LLC (Broker) Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress over the quarter. I just had one on EoE. Can you talk maybe about the potential market size and thoughts on endpoints? I know there\'s been some conversions in public domains around the FDA discussing endpoints. Thanks. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. So, in terms of market size, this is very difficult to ascertain. We know that the market size quote-unquote is "increasing." What we don\'t know whether that\'s because there\'s more patients being diagnosed or it\'s just tracking the general increase in allergic diseases. So we remind you that there\'s a strong set of evidence to indicate that eosinophilic esophagitis can be a manifestation of food allergy. And so, as an allergy, we\'re seeing lots of these increase. The actual numbers, we just don\'t feel we have a good handle on the number of patients. If Bob wants to give a shot at it, that would be great. In terms of endpoints, we saw clear results, as George mentioned, both on the patient-reported outcomes as well as the hard anatomic. In some cases in the past, for example, in ulcer disease or erosive esophagitis, FDA has used endpoints such as healing, actually, by endoscopy measured. We have not had the conversation yet with the agency about these data. They\'re very new to us, so we will do that and then sort of let you know what it\'s going to take from an approval perspective. Bob, you have... Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. Well, I think Len really nailed the situation with EoE. It is a disease that has generally been underdiagnosed. The current estimate in the U.S. among adults is somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000, but the true instance could be higher based upon underdiagnosis. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Okay. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Next question, please. Operator Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on Dupi as well and kind of how you\'re thinking about the dynamics of a bolus of severe atopic dermatitis patients for Dupixent as we see these early trends and think about the launch going forward. 1,000 scripts written per week is obviously quite an encouraging number but, one, obviously, we can\'t expect to go on forever. So, how much pent-up demand do you see out there now that you\'re in the field? Thanks. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yes. So, that\'s a very, also a very difficult question to get a hard answer on. When you talk to some doctors, they\'ll tell you, well, they had a list of patients that they were going to bring in. When you talk to other doctors, they\'ll tell you that they\'re not – the patients are just sort of showing up and they\'re incident patients which they are constantly seeing in their practice and that patients are aware of the product and want to discuss it with their doctors. How long this goes on? Well, I don\'t know, and we don\'t have enough information to see what the trends are. Have we peaked because of a bolus? Are we increasing still? Are we decreasing? Really too early to tell you. We do know that we\'re focusing on in the 100,000 to 200,000-patient range who are the most difficult to treat. I think with any new drug class, some of it is also going to be dependent upon the doctors\' reaction. The great data that I think we have in our label encourages doctors to try the product. But it will take individual experience and successes with individual patients for them to continue to use it. And so far, we even have heard some early anecdotes on that line as well. So, bottom line is we just don\'t have enough information to guide you, we\'d like to know ourselves. And I think anybody\'s guess at this point is as good as anybody else. Robert J. Terifay - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. I think Len makes an important point. There are patients in need of this important therapy and our job beyond this initial bolus is really to educate physicians and patients on the fact that there is now something that could help these patients. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. We do want to reach out and we\'ll reach out appropriately to patients directly because we believe, as Bob was just suggesting, that there are patients who have dropped out of the medical system because they\'ve been to so many different doctors with so many different regimens and nothing has helped them that making them aware that there is something new is an important part of our effort. Next question. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Operator. In the essence of time, we have one last question. After that, we will be in our office to take additional follow-up questions and our apologies to those who are in queue and who didn\'t get a chance to ask their questions. Operator Our next question comes from Hartaj Singh from Oppenheimer. Hartaj Singh - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Thanks for letting me take the – I have a question. We just noticed actually slightly different take on just on your operating expenditures you\'ve managed your P&L very well this quarter. It looks like, on just a straight run rate into the end of the year, you would actually come below your guidance and with just 110 million shares outstanding, that\'s not trivial. Just any thoughts on the progression of operating expenditures and how you\'re thinking of managing it with the Kevzara launch and all the other activities? Thank you. Leonard S. Schleifer - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Yeah. No. Thanks for the question. You\'re right in terms of the guidance that we\'ve set for the full year and where we are for the first quarter. As you can imagine, we do obviously spend a lot of time and effort in terms of forecasting where we\'re going to come out on a by-quarter basis, and the quarters are not always consistent. We are going to be in kind of full bloom in the second quarter when we get hopefully our PDUFA approval with Kevzara, and we\'ll have our full strength out there in the marketplace. And again, we do expect higher expenditures with regards to SG&A and with unreimbursed R&D in the second half of 2017. Manisha A. Narasimhan - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Thank you, operator.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Tom McCallum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Tom McCallum Thank you, Keith. Hello everyone, and welcome to Red Hat's Earnings Call for the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal '17. Speakers for today's call will be Jim Whitehurst, President and CEO, and Eric Shander, Acting CFO. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from redhat.com on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks, a schedule of currency rates and a slide deck with financial highlights and supplemental metrics that, along with our earnings press release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance for our first quarter and full fiscal year 2018. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our company business which are discussed in detail in our financial filings with the SEC, including today's press release and the risk factors and other information contained in our most recently filed Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Red Hat assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements that we may make on today's call. And with that, let me turn the call over to Jim. Jim Whitehurst Thanks Tom, and let me add my welcomes to all of you joining us on today's call. I also want to welcome Eric Shander, our acting CFO, to the call to discuss our financial results and our outlook for fiscal year '18. Our exceptional fourth quarter capped-off a strong year for Red Hat as we continued to see adoption of our technologies across hybrid cloud environments. As customers embrace digital transformation, they are turning to Red Hat as a strategic partner to deliver solutions that help them realize the benefits of these initiatives. Enterprises and service providers are increasingly adopting hybrid cloud infrastructures and open source technologies, which is fueling our growth and positioning Red Hat for the long-term. The fourth quarter enabled us to set new records and milestones for the fiscal year which reflect our growing strategic position as we continued to focus on the pressing IT challenges facing our customers. Here are just a few of the record highlights; first, the fourth quarter marked our 60th consecutive quarter of total revenue growth; second, we exceeded the $2 billion mark in subscription revenue for the fiscal year; third, strong sales execution and larger, multi-year commitments from our customers drove annual bookings to the $3 billion milestone level for the first time; and fourth, this strong sales execution led to a record total backlog of over $2.7 billion at fiscal year-end including our first fiscal year of crossing the $2 billion in total deferred revenue mark. Evidence of our increasing strategic position with our customers is seen in the remarkable growth of our large deals over the course of FY17. In every quarter this year, we saw strength in customer commitments as it related to the volume of large deals, the size of the deals, as well as the breadth of the technologies that were purchased. Every quarter this fiscal year we delivered in large deals, which contributed to record bookings, billings, backlog and revenue. Let me provide you some full year metrics. First, we closed more than 280 deals over $1 million, up approximately 30% year-over-year. Within this group, we closed a record 35 deals over $5 million and a record seven deals over $20 million. In addition, we closed our first deal of approximately $100 million in the fourth quarter with a global service provider. Now looking specifically at the 30 largest deals in Q4, here are some highlights. All of the top 30 deals were greater than a $1 million, in fact all the top 30 were $3.5 million or greater in size. We also had a record 16 deals in Q4 that were in excess of $5 million, of these four were more than $20 million. Both our middleware and our emerging cloud technologies had strong traction with our customers. Cross selling in Q4 was the highest it has ever been in a quarter, with 90% of the deals including one or more components from our group of Application Development-related and other emerging technologies offerings. Our emerging technologies accelerated the momentum we saw in Q3 with approximately one-third of our largest deals in Q4 containing an OpenStack private cloud component, approximately one-third had an OpenShift container platform component and more than a third of the deals contained Ansible, our automation management technology. In addition more than half our deals contained five or more technologies from across our portfolio. Similar to Q4 last year, the top vertical for the quarter was telecommunications where we closed a number of new, large deals with several global telecom providers. Part of our overall investment strategy was to position our portfolio of technologies and expand our go to market capabilities to further address this market. Our Q4 wins clearly demonstrate the success of our offerings, including the approximately $100 million agreement that I noted a moment ago. The second largest vertical for the largest Q4 deal was financial services followed by a broad segment of mainstream customers. Let me discuss a couple of highlights related to OpenStack and OpenShift technologies. In the fourth quarter, we continued to expand our list of top partners that offer OpenStack for their customers. We announced NFV collaborations with HP and Huawei and we recently announced an expanded cloud computing partnership with IBM to sell Red Hat's distribution of OpenStack as a private cloud offering to their customers. In the fall, IDC published a Red Hat commissioned study of customers using OpenShift. They interviewed several organizations that are using OpenShift and quantified a number of benefits these customers realized including: five-year average ROI of more than 500%; average annual benefits of nearly $1.3 million per 100 developers; more than 60% faster Application Development life cycles; and time savings in IT staff and cost savings in infrastructure, as well as millions of dollars of higher revenue per organization. These types of business benefits reinforce our view that we are operating in a hybrid cloud world for many years and that Red Hat is well positioned to expand our wallet share as we provide choice, consistency and meaningful value to customers across all four footprints: physical, virtual, private cloud and public cloud. In summary, the trends shaping the next generation of IT and business capabilities are a positive for Red Hat. As I look at opportunities in digital transformation, hybrid cloud and open source, I believe Red Hat is important across all these powerful trends. Before I turn the call over, I want to congratulate and thank our 10,000 plus Red Hat associates around the globe for their contributions to an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. Together, I believe we will continue to win in the market place that we are well positioned to deliver further growth next year and beyond. On a final note, I hope many of you will be able to join us on May 2 for Analyst Day at the Red Hat Summit in Boston. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about our strategic direction and innovative technologies. You will hear directly from our customers and partners including technology visionaries from Dell Technologies, Intel, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. With that, let me turn the call over to Eric. Eric Shander Thank you for the introduction, Jim. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank our Red Hat associates around the world for their contributions to delivering a strong quarter both operationally and financially. On last quarter's call we indicated that we expected to close the year on a strong note. I'm pleased to share that we did just that. Our fourth quarter revenue results were well above our guidance, the accelerated growth of our billings in Q4 drove our FX adjusted rolling four quarter average billings proxy metric to the highest level in five quarters and we ended the year with a record backlog. We are seeing our customers increasingly building out hybrid cloud environments and implementing digital transformation initiatives, which we believe help drive these results. Red Hat is benefitting due to our broad portfolio of solutions and proven history of delivering business value and innovation. Let me begin with the financial highlights of our Q4 performance, followed by a summary of our full fiscal year results and our outlook for FY18. For a more detailed view of our results and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to GAAP, please refer to our earnings press release. I am pleased to announce total revenue of $629 million, approximately $7 million above the high-end of our guidance and representing growth of 16% in USD and constant currency. Although currency rate volatility continued in Q4, the exchange rates stabilized to a point where many of our USD and constant currency growth rates are essentially equivalent. So, for this quarter I will keep my prepared remarks focused on our reported USD results where appropriate and you will find a table of constant currency results in our press release. Subscription revenue continued to be the largest driver of our total revenue at $560 million for the quarter, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This renewable revenue stream was 89% of the total revenue for the quarter. We continued to drive growth across our technology portfolio. Subscription revenue for our Infrastructure-related offerings was $435 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year. Our Application Development-related and other emerging technologies subscription revenue was $125 million, an increase of 40% year-over-year. Application Development-related and other emerging technologies revenue was approximately 20% of total revenue, up 340 basis points from the year ago quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income of $153 million grew 23% year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin of 24.3%, which was 30 basis points higher than guidance. As a reminder, non-GAAP operating income adjusts for non-cash share-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and transaction costs related to business combinations. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate of 29.2% was higher than expected due to a higher than expected level of income being generated in higher tax jurisdictions. As such, our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came to $0.61, in line with our guidance and up 17% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with cash and investments of approximately $2.1 billion. We returned $139 million to shareholders in the quarter through the repurchase of approximately 1.9 million shares of stock. Our repurchase program has reduced our fully diluted, weighted average shares by more than 3 million shares year-over-year. Operating cash flow was $318 million for the quarter and increased 27% from the year-ago-quarter. Strong billings growth, a modest improvement in monthly linearity and strong collections contributed to this result. The FX-adjusted days sales outstanding was at 58 days, improving from 61 days a year-ago quarter. Total deferred revenue at quarter end was $2.1 billion, an increase of $347 million or 20% over the same quarter a year ago. The total change in deferred revenue from our cash flow statement which neutralizes most of the impact of currency fluctuations increased by $357 million compared to the end of Q3. The rolling four quarter average billings proxy which is calculated by adding FX adjusted revenue plus the change in deferred revenue on the cash flow statement for the last four quarters was $690 million, up 19% year-over-year. Next, let me discuss our backlog which as a reminder, we disclose at the end of each fiscal year. Total backlog was up 28% year-over-year for a record balance in excess of $2.7 billion in USD. We define total backlog as the value of non-cancellable subscriptions and service agreements, including total deferred revenue, which is billed, plus the value of non-cancellable subscriptions and service agreements to be billed in the future not reflected in our financial statements. Here are the components; as I mentioned a moment ago, the billed portion of the backlog is total deferred revenue which was $2.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2017. The other portion of total backlog, which is yet to be billed and as such is not included in our balance sheet, was in excess of $650 million at the end of fiscal 2017, up nearly 60% compared to in excess of $410 million last fiscal year. This is the highest growth rate we have reported on this metric since we first disclosed it in FY08. It is worth noting that the portion of off-balance sheet backlog to be billed in the next twelve months was in excess of $330 million, up approximately 20% on a year-over-year basis, which is consistent with the growth in this metric for the prior two years. The backlog contributes to a significant portion of next year's revenue as well as giving us forward visibility of revenue beyond FY18. I will now review the metrics for business momentum and large deals in the quarter. We had strong bookings growth across our major geographies even with many of our largest deals being attributed to the Americas. This quarter 67% of bookings came from the Americas, 21% from EMEA and 12% from Asia-Pacific versus a 64%, 23%, 13% split in Q4 last year. The Q4 route-to-market mix was 69% from the channel and 31% from our direct sales force, compared to a 71%, 29% split in Q4 last year. The increase in the direct channel contribution was driven by the increase in large deals that closed in the quarter. Our proxy for bookings duration was approximately 25 months. This is higher than our historic duration of 21 months. Going forward, we would expect duration to move closer to the historic 21 months level. While the short term component will not be impacted by the shorter deal duration, we believe the growth rate of long term component could be impacted by the smaller pool of out-year deals. Now to briefly recap and summarize highlights for the full fiscal year; total revenue grew to $2.4 billion, up 18% in US dollars or up 17% year-over-year in constant currency and near the high-end of guidance from last March. Subscription revenue grew to $2.1 billion, an increase of 18% in both US dollars and constant currency. Subscription revenue for Infrastructure related offerings was $1.7 billion, up 15% in US dollars and 14% in constant currency. Subscription revenue for Application Development-related and other emerging technologies was $439 million, up 36% in both US dollars and constant currency. For FY17, Application Development-related and related emerging technologies subscriptions constituted 18% of total revenue, up from 16% last fiscal year. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 15% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for the full year was $2.27, up 19% over the prior year. Now I would like to turn to guidance. Our outlook assumes current business conditions and current foreign exchange rates. Our outlook is in US dollars but on a constant currency basis, we would expect a 1% headwind to Q1 revenue growth and a 2% headwind to full year FY18 revenue growth. We are forecasting our full year revenue guidance to be $2.72 billion to $2.76 billion in US dollars, up approximately 14% at the high end of the range. In FY18, we will be balancing investment in our growth initiatives and operating leverage. Our plan includes adding approximately 1,000 net new associates or approximately 10% headcount growth compared to 19% in the previous fiscal year. Given this level of investment, we expect operating margin to expand by 50 basis points to approximately 23.6% in FY18 compared to 23.1% in FY17. We expect full year non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $2.60 to $2.64 per share, assuming approximately $2 million per quarter forecast for net other income, and annual effective tax rate of 28% and approximately 180 million diluted shares. On a GAAP basis, we estimate annual stock compensation expenses of approximately $200 million and annual amortization expense of approximately $30 million. GAAP fully diluted EPS guidance includes non-cash interest expense related to the convertible debt discount of approximately $19 million. We estimate the capital expenditures to be in a range of $75 million to $85 million. Operating cash flow is expected to grow in a range from $850 million to $870 million and includes an incremental $25 million of cash paper taxes. For those of you who try to model billings metrics and quarterly cash flows, we would expect the same business flow in our model as in the past. Along with our assumption of deal duration moving to the historic 21 months level, we also expect bookings and billings to repeat their historical pattern of being lowest in Q1 and growing going forward to end at the highest level in Q4. In addition, we have also seen a continuation of sales towards the fourth quarter. For modeling purposes, we would factor in an approximate 2% increase in the percentage of full year sales that occurs in Q4 when estimating billings. Our operating cash flow guidance for FY18 has factored in this continued shift and the timing lag on collections. For Q1 specifically, we offer the following outlook; we expect revenue to be in the range of $643 million to $650 million, which is up 15% in US dollars at the high end of the range. We expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 20% and a non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.53. Our assumption on Q1 expenses including further investing in our emerging technologies as well as expenses for a number of important events in Q1 including our annual Sales and Partner Kick-off events, the opening of our Executive Briefing Center and Innovation Lab in Boston, the OpenStack Summit and our premier user event, Red Hat Summit which is moved into Q1 which was in Q2 last year. Consistent with prior practices here at Red Hat, I will not be providing a forecast for quarterly cash flow but please note that it can be variable depending upon individual payments or collections. Overall, we are very pleased with our financial performance in the fourth quarter. We are excited about the company's long-term growth opportunity in the hybrid cloud digital transformation and modernizing data centers with open source solutions. At Analyst Day in May, we will have the opportunity to have deeper discussions on our plans to realize this large, growing opportunity. I personally look forward to meeting many of you at Analyst Day. Keith, I would now like to turn it back over to you for our first question. Question-and-Answer Session Operator We'll take our first question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Matt Hedberg Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and strong close to the year. I'm wondering can you comment on how quickly your hybrid customers are growing, I know in the past you said they are growing faster than your on-prem customers but any color on that. And then maybe how quickly you your Azure partnership is processing relative to when - size? Thanks. Jim Whitehurst Yes. So coupling of things. We do have done measures of our customers who are using subscriptions on public cloud and those customers are growing substantially faster than our traditional customers. Its survey data, so I'd be hesitant to say it's perfect, but I would say substantially faster. If people are looking to leverage modern infrastructure which is often public cloud that requires modern application infrastructure and more and more of that's open source and that's Red Hat via whether it's JBoss or whether it's OpenShift. So those customers are typically growing faster than the traditional customers. Traditional workload -- we're growing single digit. So the traditional [indiscernible] workloads for customers who aren't trying to build a new portfolio on the cloud are obviously growing a bit slower. The second part of the question? Tom McCallum Azure. Jim Whitehurst Azure, has now moved into I believe our number five spot. So in terms of clouds in our raking, so it's growing really fast but you know it's off the base it started at zero, now watch it go. So hard to say whether it's growing fast or slower or not than Amazon at this point because all the numbers are kind of triple-digits, but also such a little basics. Hard to say, I do think we're pleased with the customers that are in the types of workloads that are moving. These are large sophisticated customers with production type workloads are looking to move to Azure. And so, yes, we've been very pleased with both the customer counts and the traction we're starting to make there. Tom McCallum Great next question please. [Technical Difficulty]. Operator And we can take our next question now from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Then we'll go next to Jason Adler [ph]. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst Hi. Can you hear me okay? [Technical Difficulty] Operator Let's go next to Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please go ahead. Raimo Lenschow Hi, it's Raimo here. Can you hear me? Jim Whitehurst Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us? Raimo Lenschow Yes, fine. Great. Thank you. Jim Whitehurst Must be a Windows phone system. Raimo Lenschow Right. Yes, okay. A quick question from me, Jim it was interesting to see the partnerships with HP and IBM this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in that OpenStack and that whole OpenStack community and the evolution there? Couple of quarters ago, we were all like maybe OpenStack is not that hot and interesting because in the way that's - it seems to be changing now. Can you guys kind of help us a little bit to understand this? Jim Whitehurst Yes look, I think a few quarters ago there were a lot of people thinking that OpenStack was going to be their savior against public cloud and OpenStack is a scale-out private infrastructure. It's not directly competitive with a public cloud and since the public cloud offers a lot of other services. And so, I think a lot of people misconstrued what OpenStack is and was. So we're now starting to see a more pragmatic view of OpenStack and people who need to have a scale on-premise infrastructure OpenStack is really the only alternative. We now have over 500 customers running OpenStack. We have a lot of very good large deal traction. I think the other thing that people are finding out is there needs to be a Red Hat of OpenStack, right. You need to have a vendor that does certification and confidently allow both hardware and software vendors to participate in the ecosystem. So I believe Red Hat is emerging as the Red Hat of OpenStack. So a lot of the traditional other people in the IT ecosystem and the same way we work with them on RHEL, want to work with us on OpenStack. HP is around NFV, we jointly want to serve our customers in the telco and service provider space. Deals with IBM again serving customers who want to have the consistency of experience they have with RHEL and again with OpenStack across the whole set of deployment models. So, I think we're really starting to see growing traction with OpenStack as Red Hat is emerging as the Red Hat of OpenStack. Tom McCallum Great. We're going to try this again. Operator, can we have the next question please. And if you see Mr. Murphy or Jason out there please bring them in as well. Operator We can take our next question from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Mark Murphy Yes. Thank you very much. Jim congrats on a very solid quarter. I think the magnitude of billings acceleration, it's pretty breathtaking to reach 29% here. And it's your fastest rate of billings growth, I believe in about five years. Jim Whitehurst Thank you. Mark Murphy Yes. So, I think we understand that the two government transactions. They probably shifted a few points around, but what is it that just drove so much acceleration in the broader base of business? And then I wanted to ask as well, a question for Eric. If you could just comment maybe on the relative size of OpenStack compared to OpenShift? And forgive me if prior person happen to ask anything along those lines but just which one is larger in terms of bookings or revenue run rate -- which one is larger in terms of engineering footprint etcetera? Thank you. Jim Whitehurst Alright. Well, let me start across those and then Eric, if you can dive in a little more into specifics. So first off, the two government deals we think maybe a two to three point difference, we have to do the exact math, difference in billing; so two to three points of billings growth would have moved from Q4 into Q3. Noted that $100 million plus navy deals that was public, less than $10 million of that actually build this quarter because it's the first year and their budget kill terms and other things and that does not show up at our backlog because government deals happen when you're at a time they are not committed. So that was about $9 million and the other deal is kind of $20 million, all in; that would have moved; so again a couple of points of growth either way. I should also note that the $100 million service provider deal we talked about also its building one year at a time. So really the traction was just strong bookings growth across the board. We added a lot of people in the first half of the year that we talked about last year that we're going to make significant investments and those people got up speed and you know, certainly about three quarters in, we start seeing real productivity out of -- especially sales resources that we've hired and so those resources are upto speed and so kind of hit nicely across the board. Related to OpenStack and OpenShift, Eric probably has a little more numbers but a couple of comments around that, recognize that we - and we talked about large service provider deals; the $100 million deal was not OpenStack but the next three largest deals were all primarily OpenStack. So there was a lot of OpenStack traction this quarter, recognize it does munch a little bit with RHEL because when you buy OpenStack, you get RHEL. So those numbers right now will be bigger than the OpenShift deals because of that. In terms of engineering, part to say which is larger, the reason we feel confident of OpenStack and OpenShift is they are both Linux based technologies. So much of the work that we do with OpenStack is around KVM and changes in the Linux funnel [ph] which is why we feel like we're positioned to win an OpenStack. The same is true in containers, right, these are Linux containers; so all the work around C groups and security and other things and containers around Linux. So it's not really easy to tease out exactly what the OpenStack versus OpenShift versus Linux engineering is, but with that it's context. Eric, do you… Eric Shander Sure. So Mark just in terms of the actual number of deals that we had -- so we had 11 deals with -- they had open stack in them and then we had another nine with OpenShift. And back to your point in terms of the overall growth of the billings; I mean clearly, that we did what we said we were going to do. A lot of focus was put on longer term deals so that our teams can continue to focus in on newer clients and opportunities. So we -- I think are very proud of what the team executed in terms of the quarter and we set out to do that at the beginning of the fourth quarter and that's exactly what we did. Jim Whitehurst One last note on billings, so if you look at our Top 10 deals; eight of those deals were multi-year deals, half of those build upfront and half didn't. If all of our Top 10 deals build upfront, our billings would have $100 million higher. So to give you a sense, our short-term billings also group quite nicely, it's not just collections of the long-term. Mark Murphy Thank you. Tom McCallum Next please? Keith, next question please? Sorry folks, we're shouldn't be having a problem with the operator. Operator, please, next question? We don't seem to have him on here. Keith? Operator Important interruption. Now Jason Adler [ph], your line is open. Jim Whitehurst Alright, thank you. Jason can you hear us? Unidentified Analyst This is fine. How you guys doing? Jim Whitehurst Started up with the question. Thanks, Jim. Unidentified Analyst Great. Yes, it was nice to see the operating margin guide up for fiscal '18. Should we expect operating margin expansion is going to be the gameplan beyond fiscal year '18, in other words, you're now on a path of some modest operating margin expansion every year going forward; is that going to be the strategy? Jim Whitehurst So Jason, I mean as we -- as we mentioned back last year during Analyst Day, it is our view to take a balanced approach. We continue to be very focused, as we look at the investments, you know, this year we're going to continue to invest in sales, services, support and our engineering services; that are obviously driving the future. We feel that the available timeout there is significant. So we're going to assess each year as it comes but you know right now we are starting to see a payback from the investments that we've made in the emerging technologies which has allowed us to provide some expansion this year. So at this point it's early but you know, certainly we're going to continue as we go throughout this year and into future years, maintain a balanced approach in terms of both growth as well as leverage. Unidentified Analyst Great. Jim Whitehurst Yes, not trying to be cute on answering that. I mean just frankly, we feel very, very good about our position and the momentum we have; OpenStack and OpenShift which have been our kind of significant investments over the last several years, are showing real payback. And so naturally one would assume kind of course and speed therefore the margin expansion because it that those businesses have similar or better margin characteristics than the core RHEL business given the stickiness. That said, we have to look at size of opportunity, investments we need to make around sales and so we'll - obviously we can have more dialogue at Analyst Day about that in more detail and kind of as we go forward and see the relative momentum, we'll continue to update you on it. Tom McCallum Afraid to do this, maybe you should just let keeping Jason ask questions but operator, please next question? Operator And we will take the next question from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead. Brian White Yes, I'm wondering if you could talk to a little bit about how 5G is starting to impact or could impact your OpenStack business. And if it has any repercussions for Linux? Obviously, Mobile [ph] Congress's was a few weeks ago, NFE was a huge theme, OpenStack was part of that; so maybe you can tie it together, 5G with Red Hat? Thanks. Jim Whitehurst Well, we see this as a very significant opportunity for us. 5G and just the increase in the amount of data being communicated will require new infrastructure and I think it's pretty safe to say that that new infrastructure will be commodity hardware running OpenStack. One of the reasons we've been so excited about the opportunity is just like with Linux, there needs to be an industry standard that every piece of hardware can certify too and in this case every VNF, every virtual network function can certify too. Red Hat is that natural player, we've done it before with Linux, we've demonstrated we can do it with mission critical workloads; that needs to happen with OpenStack and I think that Red Hat is emerging as that leader. You know, three of our big four deals were eight figure OpenStack deals, two of those were with telco services providers. So I think we're making really good progress there, I think that market could be very, very large for us as we go forward and telco start rolling out that infrastructure scale. The two eight figure telco deals that happened this quarter and OpenStack, those are for tiny, tiny components of their network at this point; as those things expand they can get quite large. Tom McCallum Great. Next question Keith, please. Operator Yes, we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard Hi, thanks. Question for Eric I guess. Last quarter there was talk of cash collection and some uncertainty around sort of the collection you expected on transactions you signed in Q3 and or guess some variance in that and it worked to the negative side in Q3. And it looks like that wasn't an issue here but as you look at your guidance for next year, what you've embedded in terms of cash collection term on deals and if you expect some of the issues on Q3 to repeat there? Eric Shander So sure, Walter. So I mean as you can imagine -- I mean linearity continues to be something that we focus in on. The team did a great job this past quarter in terms of addressing linearity but you know, as we've mentioned in the past, trying to address linearity or completely eliminate linearity wouldn't be necessarily something that financial makes sense because a lot of times clients certainly know in terms of negotiating, you know, getting deals to the very end. So what we've essentially done in our guidance as well as the cash flow modeling is we've assumed this was the 2% that I'd had mentioned in my prepared remarks. We've assumed the 2% shift of business into Q4 and we've rippled that through the cash flow statement. So we continue to be very focused in terms of collecting our cash timely, there is no change to any of our payment terms, it's not our desire to change the payment terms but certainly we're going to stay very focused in our linearity as we go into next year. Walter Pritchard Great, thanks. Tom McCallum Next question, please. Operator And we'll go next to Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne Hi, thanks very much. I was wondering if you talk just about -- a little bit more about open shift, specifically just where you're seeing the momentum for this product. I was just curious from -- is there any sort of demand coming from specific vertical or geography at this point in time, just trying to get a little bit more color on where you're seeing demand from that for OpenShift right now? Thanks. Jim Whitehurst Yes, so I would say the largest vertical at this point is for us right now is financial services. You know, I think there is several reasons for that. First off we've had historically strong relationships with financial services. So we have good relationships already built there. Also I think financial services recognizes the need for long-term support, a life-cycled OS, a commitment around binary compatibility, all things that RHEL's always done. And so as the large financial services companies have evaluated container platforms, I think we could transact kind of that default choice. Third, I think there -- as these enterprises look to run stake-full applications and migrate existing Web Logic, Web Sphere [ph] type workloads onto a scale out infrastructure, OpenShift is the only solution to do that. The competitors in the container platform world don't support staple application or JEE. And so I think that allows us to specially with kind of industry like financial services to different ourselves. But again we have strengths, we had public reference as we had speaking in our last Analyst Day, on the days and we have across the whole set of verticals but without a data and say right now financial services is the strongest. Tom McCallum Great, next question please. Kirk Materne And just as a quick… Tom McCallum Quick follow-up? Go ahead. Kirk Materne Just to get a quick follow-up, just anything on a geographic basis. I assume you're talking about financial services in the Americas or is it OpenShift pretty… Jim Whitehurst No, we have a lot in Europe as well. I would call it pretty balanced between Europe and the U.S. on OpenShift and financial services. Some of the big banks in London or quite large users as well. Kirk Materne Thanks. Tom McCallum Great, next question please. Operator We'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Michael Turits How was the cloud on a full year basis last year, you gave it at $100 million? We're trailing and any -- can we get a sense of what it was this year and also is that starting to -- is that going to continue to have a negative impact at all on billing or invoicing duration? Jim Whitehurst Yes. Well, I'll start. We said last quarter that we will update you when we hit the $200 million milestone which is either one being Q1 or Q2 of this year. I still think we feel very confident, that it will be in either Q1 or Q2. In terms of billings, it is a headwind obviously in terms of billings because of the impact on duration. So I don't -- do we have a… Eric Shander Yes. So we approximate it to be about $120 million headwind, a theoretical headwind to billings for the year. As Jim mentioned, I mean it's an area that continues to grow. It's a nice business for us. And yes, but we would say it's about $120 million headwind to billings. That's the crazy cloud access component. The CCSP program, our cloud access to our customers just take their subscriptions to Amazon or other clouds that bills the normal. So it only to CCSP piece that they are [indiscernible]. Michael Turits Sure. Thanks. Tom McCallum Great. Thanks. Next question please. Operator We'll go next to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead Good. Thanks maybe one for Jim and one for Eric. Jim the emerging bucket, up 40% is a big acceleration you mentioned in your remarks about better cross selling. But do you mind elaborating on that were there any one-time things in there because that stood out to me? And then for Eric; if we could just return to the operating cash flow guide, I think the high end of revs and high end of operating cash flow implies a 31.5% margin roughly equal to what you did in fiscal year '17. But that's still well below the 35% operating cash flow margin level you were putting up year-after-year. And I'm wondering is the guide just heading for fiscal '18, does that have upside potential or is there some change in perhaps the use of working capital that's worth pointing out? Thank you. Jim Whitehurst So I'll start. As we said, we had three big OpenStack deals in the top four deals, so not the $100 million deal which was primarily middleware and well I guess that was in there too then. A lot of that -- but the next three were significant OpenStack deal, so obviously those are emerging. That largest deal we did the $100 million deal, well there was a reasonable amount of RHEL, there was a lot of middleware in that as well as that telco is looking to migrate from web logic and Web Sphere to JBoss. So those had a significant impact, as well as just begin at the size of the OpenStack deals can kind of move those numbers around. Eric Shander Yes, and just in terms of the operating cash flow, as we mentioned that the big focus that we have is certainly linearity and as I mentioned the 2% shift that was essentially down from the quarters one, two, three and quarter four. I mean obviously you are going to see that in the accounts receivable and clearly something that we're continuing to focus in on that to the extent that we can obviously make sure that that is minimized as we go forward and we well but, it's certainly, it's a business reality that we see and also at some of the larger deals as you would expect, they are only billing one year in advance. So that's pretty common and pretty expected and that's not all of our transactions but certainly as deals get bigger, we'll become a larger portion of the IT wallet share spend, that's going to be something that we're going to continue to deal with. Karl Keirstead Okay. Thank you, both. Eric Shander You are welcome. Tom McCallum Great. Thank you. Next question please, operator. Operator We'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question on very next quarter. I was hoping to dig in on that cash flow question a little bit more, because there seems like there are lot of moving pieces that are all working against you for operating cash flow. Correct me if I am wrong, it seems like billings, like the $120 million billings headwinds. That should be negative to cash flow, you were talking about the seasonality that was negative to cash flow. You're talking about increasing cash taxes, am I thinking about this right, as just it just seems like there's a lot of things stacked against operating cash flow versus sort of the maybe the -- where we should be focusing, while our margins are actually in the right direction. Jim Whitehurst Yes. I mean so, certainly all of the items that you mentioned that they certainly do have an impact to cash flow for sure Keith. And as I mentioned these are items that were actively working and certainly where we can get efficiencies on the margin side to kind of help offset some of that we certainly are. But there are certainly several items that are impacting cash flow as we continue to go forward. Keith Weiss And then if I could just one follow-on. Jim you never commented earlier about the economics of OpenStack and OpenShift, as the higher value solutions you expect them to have better margin. Is that - I am assuming there are better margins over time just given the scale of the real business and the ability to have very high margins? Jim Whitehurst Yes. So what I mean by that is the price points are dramatically higher, which also helps spring sales up-down. So like OpenShift is literally almost 20X the price of RHEL on the same two-socket server. Right now, though we have massive investments in those and they're both without fully allocated basis losing a lot of money because we're putting more sales and R&D effort against than that we are generating in revenue in the short run. So that's more to say that, I think those are stickier technologies. I think you will not have the same dynamics we have with RHEL, while RHEL is great. You do get customers who threaten the self-support, that's probably the primary kind of competitor for us on a renewal where with something like OpenShift and OpenStack we get many more technologies. It's not just kind of one easy go download sent off kind of thing. I think the renewal rate is likely to be quite a bit higher and again the deal sizes are larger because the ASP's are so much higher, which was -- for us to believe adding more study state that those should actually have better margins than RHEL. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you very much Jim. Jim Whitehurst Thank you, Keith. Next question please operator. Operator We'll go next to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Keith Bachman Hi. Thank you very much. One good thing based on the communications issue, every time you kept saying Keith are you there I thought you guys were asking for me. So I felt pretty good about that. Perhaps the previous speaker as well. I did want to ask two quickies. Number one, in the context of your guidance with revenues in the past you've talked about at the last Analyst Meeting infrastructure, growth potential as you didn't get specific but you called it team. Should we be thinking about that as it relates to an underlay within the context to your revenue guidance for FY18? Jim Whitehurst Yes. Keith Bachman Okay, thank you. And the second one is the renewal rate. You had another really strong renewal rate quarter, but it's been bouncing around between 105% to start the year and you finished at 120%. How are you thinking about that renewal rate as you look at FY18 guidance? Jim Whitehurst Yes. So we ended up the fourth quarter in excess of 120% and that would be our expectation as we go into next year as well. Keith Bachman So sorry, just to be clear. Is it 120% you're thinking for the year or is it that you're saying ending the year in that kind of renewal rate? Jim Whitehurst Yes. For the year. Keith Bachman Okay, alright, great. Thanks very much. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Tom McCallum Thanks, Keith. Next question, please. Operator We'll go next to Ben McFadden with Pacific Crest. Ben McFadden Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask questions going back to these emerging businesses. You said a third of the top deals in OpenShift, OpenStack or Ansible. I wonder if you could address kind of how we should be thinking about how often these emerging solutions get sold together, especially as we relate to Ansible is that being sold with OpenShift or OpenStack or any metrics you can give on the cross sell rates of some of your emerging solutions in your portfolio. Eric Shander Yes. I'll start and let me actually look through the numbers to tell. But Ansible is often sold as part of a broader solutions. One of the reasons we acquired the company is it's a great standalone automation solution, but in a scale out world automation becomes increasingly important. So our customers who want to buy cloud forms often also acquire Ansible. Most of it, I would bet that most of our OpenStack and OpenShift customers buy at least a degree of Ansible as well. It really does just -- it becomes a core component of the way you're going to manage an automating modern infrastructure. So Ansible especially is in many of those same deal. OpenStack and OpenShift is kind of a mix often OpenShift will run on top of OpenStack, but some of the largest deals that I mentioned are over telco deals that were just OpenStack. One of those big top four was OpenShift running on OpenStack just kind of looking down. It really is a mix. So they are often sold together because you got to have a deployment target for OpenShift. The sale point we use over-and-over again is you can run it on Amazon, you can run it on Azure, you can run it on VMware, you can run it on OpenStack and it really is a mix. In this quarter, actually a fair number of the OpenShift deals also weighed in on OpenStack. So there's a reasonable amount of cross sell there. Ben McFadden Great. Thank you. Tom McCallum Great. Next question, please. Operator Next we'll go to Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba Yes, thank you. Great quarter. Jim as you are signing these mega deals. Can you talk what it was in the marketplace in fiscal '17 that drove such an acceleration in number of large teams and their sizes? We saw this big uptick in last year in fiscal '15 and this year seems to be another big step up. What's driving this acceleration? Jim Whitehurst I think its couple of things. One is often times those include OpenStack or OpenShift, which are just a very - they do a lot more than our independent technology in terms of the size and scope of the customer problems they address. So there are higher price points and so those deals get to be larger as people are putting those in their infrastructure. Second one is just as enterprises are accelerating their application migration to more modern architecture there is a need for the technologies to help them do that. So the largest $100 million deal, really that was our middleware portfolio, but a lot of that with the customer looking to migrate from some of their traditional heavyweight JEE stuff to our portfolio to save money. But also make it easier to land that on more modern platform. So I guess, more and more enterprises are saying, “Oh, I may want to use public cloud in the future. I want to use it now”. There now have a bunch of applications that are capable of running on a public cloud. So they need to partner with someone like Red Hat who can get those applications without massive modifications on scale out infrastructure. And those deals just become bigger because of the size of the value and the scope of the technologies involved. Tom McCallum Hi everyone. I'm afraid, we have time for one more question. I want to apologize on behalf of the team here apparently we had some service provide issue. So we will try to follow-up with everybody who has additional questions. I'm afraid for the official call, we have a hard stop at six. So we have time for one more operator. Operator And we'll go to Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi Thanks for taking my question. It's good to see such a large number of $5 million plus deals. And also you talked about five or more technology in half of the deals include. Just wondering if you could give some color about storage business. We heard about CCSP [ph] a couple of years ago it was getting good traction, I'm wondering at what percentage of your emerging technology now storage and what's your expectation going forward. Jim Whitehurst So, let me give a little bit of contact. I think in terms of standalone storage five deals had standalone storage components in that top 30 deals. But just a little bit of contact there, we see CCSP [ph] project sold often with OpenStack and Gluster and much of the Gluster roadmap is around adding capability into OpenShift. So we can talk about standalone storage and again there were five deals that had standalone storage components in there. But it's a pretty important part of both our OpenStack and our OpenShift products as we are needing to offer whether it's state in OpenShift or broadly easy access to storage in OpenStack. So again, five on a standalone basis. But those technologies are wrapped in the OpenShift and OpenStack components of our business and one of the reasons that those businesses are growing so nicely. Tom McCallum Great. Operator, that's all the time we have today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. We will try to reach out to everybody. If there are any additional questions, feel free to reach out to Sarah and I and we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We also have Analyst Day coming up in early May and if you haven't been invited and you want to come, please let us know as well. Thank you everyone for your time.

Matt Hedberg Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter and strong close to the year. I'm wondering can you comment on how quickly your hybrid customers are growing, I know in the past you said they are growing faster than your on-prem customers but any color on that.

So in terms of clouds in our raking, so it's growing really fast but you know it's off the base it started at zero, now watch it go.

Jim Whitehurst Yes, we can hear you. Can you hear us? Raimo Lenschow Yes, fine. Great. Thank you. Jim Whitehurst Must be a Windows phone system. Raimo Lenschow Right. Yes, okay. A quick question from me, Jim it was interesting to see the partnerships with HP and IBM this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in that OpenStack and that whole OpenStack community and the evolution there? Couple of quarters ago, we were all like maybe OpenStack is not that hot and interesting because in the way that's - it seems to be changing now. Can you guys kind of help us a little bit to understand this? Jim Whitehurst Yes look, I think a few quarters ago there were a lot of people thinking that OpenStack was going to be their savior against public cloud and OpenStack is a scale-out private infrastructure. It's not directly competitive with a public cloud and since the public cloud offers a lot of other services. And so, I think a lot of people misconstrued what OpenStack is and was. So we're now starting to see a more pragmatic view of OpenStack and people who need to have a scale on-premise infrastructure OpenStack is really the only alternative. We now have over 500 customers running OpenStack. We have a lot of very good large deal traction. I think the other thing that people are finding out is there needs to be a Red Hat of OpenStack, right. You need to have a vendor that does certification and confidently allow both hardware and software vendors to participate in the ecosystem. So I believe Red Hat is emerging as the Red Hat of OpenStack. So a lot of the traditional other people in the IT ecosystem and the same way we work with them on RHEL, want to work with us on OpenStack. HP is around NFV, we jointly want to serve our customers in the telco and service provider space. Deals with IBM again serving customers who want to have the consistency of experience they have with RHEL and again with OpenStack across the whole set of deployment models. So, I think we're really starting to see growing traction with OpenStack as Red Hat is emerging as the Red Hat of OpenStack. Tom McCallum Great. We're going to try this again. Operator, can we have the next question please. And if you see Mr. Murphy or Jason out there please bring them in as well. Operator We can take our next question from Mark Murphy with JP Morgan. Mark Murphy Yes. Thank you very much. Jim congrats on a very solid quarter. I think the magnitude of billings acceleration, it's pretty breathtaking to reach 29% here. And it's your fastest rate of billings growth, I believe in about five years. Jim Whitehurst Thank you. Mark Murphy Yes. So, I think we understand that the two government transactions. They probably shifted a few points around, but what is it that just drove so much acceleration in the broader base of business? And then I wanted to ask as well, a question for Eric. If you could just comment maybe on the relative size of OpenStack compared to OpenShift? And forgive me if prior person happen to ask anything along those lines but just which one is larger in terms of bookings or revenue run rate -- which one is larger in terms of engineering footprint etcetera? Thank you. Jim Whitehurst Alright. Well, let me start across those and then Eric, if you can dive in a little more into specifics. So first off, the two government deals we think maybe a two to three point difference, we have to do the exact math, difference in billing; so two to three points of billings growth would have moved from Q4 into Q3. Noted that $100 million plus navy deals that was public, less than $10 million of that actually build this quarter because it's the first year and their budget kill terms and other things and that does not show up at our backlog because government deals happen when you're at a time they are not committed. So that was about $9 million and the other deal is kind of $20 million, all in; that would have moved; so again a couple of points of growth either way. I should also note that the $100 million service provider deal we talked about also its building one year at a time. So really the traction was just strong bookings growth across the board. We added a lot of people in the first half of the year that we talked about last year that we're going to make significant investments and those people got up speed and you know, certainly about three quarters in, we start seeing real productivity out of -- especially sales resources that we've hired and so those resources are upto speed and so kind of hit nicely across the board. Related to OpenStack and OpenShift, Eric probably has a little more numbers but a couple of comments around that, recognize that we - and we talked about large service provider deals; the $100 million deal was not OpenStack but the next three largest deals were all primarily OpenStack. So there was a lot of OpenStack traction this quarter, recognize it does munch a little bit with RHEL because when you buy OpenStack, you get RHEL. So those numbers right now will be bigger than the OpenShift deals because of that. In terms of engineering, part to say which is larger, the reason we feel confident of OpenStack and OpenShift is they are both Linux based technologies. So much of the work that we do with OpenStack is around KVM and changes in the Linux funnel [ph] which is why we feel like we're positioned to win an OpenStack. The same is true in containers, right, these are Linux containers; so all the work around C groups and security and other things and containers around Linux. So it's not really easy to tease out exactly what the OpenStack versus OpenShift versus Linux engineering is, but with that it's context. Eric, do you… Eric Shander Sure. So Mark just in terms of the actual number of deals that we had -- so we had 11 deals with -- they had open stack in them and then we had another nine with OpenShift. And back to your point in terms of the overall growth of the billings; I mean clearly, that we did what we said we were going to do. A lot of focus was put on longer term deals so that our teams can continue to focus in on newer clients and opportunities. So we -- I think are very proud of what the team executed in terms of the quarter and we set out to do that at the beginning of the fourth quarter and that's exactly what we did. Jim Whitehurst One last note on billings, so if you look at our Top 10 deals; eight of those deals were multi-year deals, half of those build upfront and half didn't. If all of our Top 10 deals build upfront, our billings would have $100 million higher. So to give you a sense, our short-term billings also group quite nicely, it's not just collections of the long-term. Mark Murphy Thank you. Tom McCallum Next please? Keith, next question please? Sorry folks, we're shouldn't be having a problem with the operator. Operator, please, next question? We don't seem to have him on here. Keith? Operator Important interruption. Now Jason Adler [ph], your line is open. Jim Whitehurst Alright, thank you. Jason can you hear us? Unidentified Analyst This is fine. How you guys doing? Jim Whitehurst Started up with the question. Thanks, Jim. Unidentified Analyst Great. Yes, it was nice to see the operating margin guide up for fiscal '18. Should we expect operating margin expansion is going to be the gameplan beyond fiscal year '18, in other words, you're now on a path of some modest operating margin expansion every year going forward; is that going to be the strategy? Jim Whitehurst So Jason, I mean as we -- as we mentioned back last year during Analyst Day, it is our view to take a balanced approach. We continue to be very focused, as we look at the investments, you know, this year we're going to continue to invest in sales, services, support and our engineering services; that are obviously driving the future. We feel that the available timeout there is significant. So we're going to assess each year as it comes but you know right now we are starting to see a payback from the investments that we've made in the emerging technologies which has allowed us to provide some expansion this year. So at this point it's early but you know, certainly we're going to continue as we go throughout this year and into future years, maintain a balanced approach in terms of both growth as well as leverage. Unidentified Analyst Great. Jim Whitehurst Yes, not trying to be cute on answering that. I mean just frankly, we feel very, very good about our position and the momentum we have; OpenStack and OpenShift which have been our kind of significant investments over the last several years, are showing real payback. And so naturally one would assume kind of course and speed therefore the margin expansion because it that those businesses have similar or better margin characteristics than the core RHEL business given the stickiness. That said, we have to look at size of opportunity, investments we need to make around sales and so we'll - obviously we can have more dialogue at Analyst Day about that in more detail and kind of as we go forward and see the relative momentum, we'll continue to update you on it. Tom McCallum Afraid to do this, maybe you should just let keeping Jason ask questions but operator, please next question? Operator And we will take the next question from Brian White with Drexel. Please go ahead. Brian White Yes, I'm wondering if you could talk to a little bit about how 5G is starting to impact or could impact your OpenStack business. And if it has any repercussions for Linux? Obviously, Mobile [ph] Congress's was a few weeks ago, NFE was a huge theme, OpenStack was part of that; so maybe you can tie it together, 5G with Red Hat? Thanks. Jim Whitehurst Well, we see this as a very significant opportunity for us. 5G and just the increase in the amount of data being communicated will require new infrastructure and I think it's pretty safe to say that that new infrastructure will be commodity hardware running OpenStack. One of the reasons we've been so excited about the opportunity is just like with Linux, there needs to be an industry standard that every piece of hardware can certify too and in this case every VNF, every virtual network function can certify too. Red Hat is that natural player, we've done it before with Linux, we've demonstrated we can do it with mission critical workloads; that needs to happen with OpenStack and I think that Red Hat is emerging as that leader. You know, three of our big four deals were eight figure OpenStack deals, two of those were with telco services providers. So I think we're making really good progress there, I think that market could be very, very large for us as we go forward and telco start rolling out that infrastructure scale. The two eight figure telco deals that happened this quarter and OpenStack, those are for tiny, tiny components of their network at this point; as those things expand they can get quite large. Tom McCallum Great. Next question Keith, please. Operator Yes, we'll go next to Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please go ahead. Walter Pritchard Hi, thanks. Question for Eric I guess. Last quarter there was talk of cash collection and some uncertainty around sort of the collection you expected on transactions you signed in Q3 and or guess some variance in that and it worked to the negative side in Q3. And it looks like that wasn't an issue here but as you look at your guidance for next year, what you've embedded in terms of cash collection term on deals and if you expect some of the issues on Q3 to repeat there? Eric Shander So sure, Walter. So I mean as you can imagine -- I mean linearity continues to be something that we focus in on. The team did a great job this past quarter in terms of addressing linearity but you know, as we've mentioned in the past, trying to address linearity or completely eliminate linearity wouldn't be necessarily something that financial makes sense because a lot of times clients certainly know in terms of negotiating, you know, getting deals to the very end. So what we've essentially done in our guidance as well as the cash flow modeling is we've assumed this was the 2% that I'd had mentioned in my prepared remarks. We've assumed the 2% shift of business into Q4 and we've rippled that through the cash flow statement. So we continue to be very focused in terms of collecting our cash timely, there is no change to any of our payment terms, it's not our desire to change the payment terms but certainly we're going to stay very focused in our linearity as we go into next year. Walter Pritchard Great, thanks. Tom McCallum Next question, please. Operator And we'll go next to Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Kirk Materne Hi, thanks very much. I was wondering if you talk just about -- a little bit more about open shift, specifically just where you're seeing the momentum for this product. I was just curious from -- is there any sort of demand coming from specific vertical or geography at this point in time, just trying to get a little bit more color on where you're seeing demand from that for OpenShift right now? Thanks. Jim Whitehurst Yes, so I would say the largest vertical at this point is for us right now is financial services. You know, I think there is several reasons for that. First off we've had historically strong relationships with financial services. So we have good relationships already built there. Also I think financial services recognizes the need for long-term support, a life-cycled OS, a commitment around binary compatibility, all things that RHEL's always done. And so as the large financial services companies have evaluated container platforms, I think we could transact kind of that default choice. Third, I think there -- as these enterprises look to run stake-full applications and migrate existing Web Logic, Web Sphere [ph] type workloads onto a scale out infrastructure, OpenShift is the only solution to do that. The competitors in the container platform world don't support staple application or JEE. And so I think that allows us to specially with kind of industry like financial services to different ourselves. But again we have strengths, we had public reference as we had speaking in our last Analyst Day, on the days and we have across the whole set of verticals but without a data and say right now financial services is the strongest. Tom McCallum Great, next question please. Kirk Materne And just as a quick… Tom McCallum Quick follow-up? Go ahead. Kirk Materne Just to get a quick follow-up, just anything on a geographic basis. I assume you're talking about financial services in the Americas or is it OpenShift pretty… Jim Whitehurst No, we have a lot in Europe as well. I would call it pretty balanced between Europe and the U.S. on OpenShift and financial services. Some of the big banks in London or quite large users as well. Kirk Materne Thanks. Tom McCallum Great, next question please. Operator We'll go next to Michael Turits with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Michael Turits How was the cloud on a full year basis last year, you gave it at $100 million? We're trailing and any -- can we get a sense of what it was this year and also is that starting to -- is that going to continue to have a negative impact at all on billing or invoicing duration? Jim Whitehurst Yes. Well, I'll start. We said last quarter that we will update you when we hit the $200 million milestone which is either one being Q1 or Q2 of this year. I still think we feel very confident, that it will be in either Q1 or Q2. In terms of billings, it is a headwind obviously in terms of billings because of the impact on duration. So I don't -- do we have a… Eric Shander Yes. So we approximate it to be about $120 million headwind, a theoretical headwind to billings for the year. As Jim mentioned, I mean it's an area that continues to grow. It's a nice business for us. And yes, but we would say it's about $120 million headwind to billings. That's the crazy cloud access component. The CCSP program, our cloud access to our customers just take their subscriptions to Amazon or other clouds that bills the normal. So it only to CCSP piece that they are [indiscernible]. Michael Turits Sure. Thanks. Tom McCallum Great. Thanks. Next question please. Operator We'll go next to Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Karl Keirstead Good. Thanks maybe one for Jim and one for Eric. Jim the emerging bucket, up 40% is a big acceleration you mentioned in your remarks about better cross selling. But do you mind elaborating on that were there any one-time things in there because that stood out to me? And then for Eric; if we could just return to the operating cash flow guide, I think the high end of revs and high end of operating cash flow implies a 31.5% margin roughly equal to what you did in fiscal year '17. But that's still well below the 35% operating cash flow margin level you were putting up year-after-year. And I'm wondering is the guide just heading for fiscal '18, does that have upside potential or is there some change in perhaps the use of working capital that's worth pointing out? Thank you. Jim Whitehurst So I'll start. As we said, we had three big OpenStack deals in the top four deals, so not the $100 million deal which was primarily middleware and well I guess that was in there too then. A lot of that -- but the next three were significant OpenStack deal, so obviously those are emerging. That largest deal we did the $100 million deal, well there was a reasonable amount of RHEL, there was a lot of middleware in that as well as that telco is looking to migrate from web logic and Web Sphere to JBoss. So those had a significant impact, as well as just begin at the size of the OpenStack deals can kind of move those numbers around. Eric Shander Yes, and just in terms of the operating cash flow, as we mentioned that the big focus that we have is certainly linearity and as I mentioned the 2% shift that was essentially down from the quarters one, two, three and quarter four. I mean obviously you are going to see that in the accounts receivable and clearly something that we're continuing to focus in on that to the extent that we can obviously make sure that that is minimized as we go forward and we well but, it's certainly, it's a business reality that we see and also at some of the larger deals as you would expect, they are only billing one year in advance. So that's pretty common and pretty expected and that's not all of our transactions but certainly as deals get bigger, we'll become a larger portion of the IT wallet share spend, that's going to be something that we're going to continue to deal with. Karl Keirstead Okay. Thank you, both. Eric Shander You are welcome. Tom McCallum Great. Thank you. Next question please, operator. Operator We'll go next to Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question on very next quarter. I was hoping to dig in on that cash flow question a little bit more, because there seems like there are lot of moving pieces that are all working against you for operating cash flow. Correct me if I am wrong, it seems like billings, like the $120 million billings headwinds. That should be negative to cash flow, you were talking about the seasonality that was negative to cash flow. You're talking about increasing cash taxes, am I thinking about this right, as just it just seems like there's a lot of things stacked against operating cash flow versus sort of the maybe the -- where we should be focusing, while our margins are actually in the right direction. Jim Whitehurst Yes. I mean so, certainly all of the items that you mentioned that they certainly do have an impact to cash flow for sure Keith. And as I mentioned these are items that were actively working and certainly where we can get efficiencies on the margin side to kind of help offset some of that we certainly are. But there are certainly several items that are impacting cash flow as we continue to go forward. Keith Weiss And then if I could just one follow-on. Jim you never commented earlier about the economics of OpenStack and OpenShift, as the higher value solutions you expect them to have better margin. Is that - I am assuming there are better margins over time just given the scale of the real business and the ability to have very high margins? Jim Whitehurst Yes. So what I mean by that is the price points are dramatically higher, which also helps spring sales up-down. So like OpenShift is literally almost 20X the price of RHEL on the same two-socket server. Right now, though we have massive investments in those and they're both without fully allocated basis losing a lot of money because we're putting more sales and R&D effort against than that we are generating in revenue in the short run. So that's more to say that, I think those are stickier technologies. I think you will not have the same dynamics we have with RHEL, while RHEL is great. You do get customers who threaten the self-support, that's probably the primary kind of competitor for us on a renewal where with something like OpenShift and OpenStack we get many more technologies. It's not just kind of one easy go download sent off kind of thing. I think the renewal rate is likely to be quite a bit higher and again the deal sizes are larger because the ASP's are so much higher, which was -- for us to believe adding more study state that those should actually have better margins than RHEL. Keith Weiss Excellent. Thank you very much Jim. Jim Whitehurst Thank you, Keith. Next question please operator. Operator We'll go next to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Keith Bachman Hi. Thank you very much. One good thing based on the communications issue, every time you kept saying Keith are you there I thought you guys were asking for me. So I felt pretty good about that. Perhaps the previous speaker as well. I did want to ask two quickies. Number one, in the context of your guidance with revenues in the past you've talked about at the last Analyst Meeting infrastructure, growth potential as you didn't get specific but you called it team. Should we be thinking about that as it relates to an underlay within the context to your revenue guidance for FY18? Jim Whitehurst Yes. Keith Bachman Okay, thank you. And the second one is the renewal rate. You had another really strong renewal rate quarter, but it's been bouncing around between 105% to start the year and you finished at 120%. How are you thinking about that renewal rate as you look at FY18 guidance? Jim Whitehurst Yes. So we ended up the fourth quarter in excess of 120% and that would be our expectation as we go into next year as well. Keith Bachman So sorry, just to be clear. Is it 120% you're thinking for the year or is it that you're saying ending the year in that kind of renewal rate? Jim Whitehurst Yes. For the year. Keith Bachman Okay, alright, great. Thanks very much. Congratulations on a solid quarter. Tom McCallum Thanks, Keith. Next question, please. Operator We'll go next to Ben McFadden with Pacific Crest. Ben McFadden Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask questions going back to these emerging businesses. You said a third of the top deals in OpenShift, OpenStack or Ansible. I wonder if you could address kind of how we should be thinking about how often these emerging solutions get sold together, especially as we relate to Ansible is that being sold with OpenShift or OpenStack or any metrics you can give on the cross sell rates of some of your emerging solutions in your portfolio. Eric Shander Yes. I'll start and let me actually look through the numbers to tell. But Ansible is often sold as part of a broader solutions. One of the reasons we acquired the company is it's a great standalone automation solution, but in a scale out world automation becomes increasingly important. So our customers who want to buy cloud forms often also acquire Ansible. Most of it, I would bet that most of our OpenStack and OpenShift customers buy at least a degree of Ansible as well. It really does just -- it becomes a core component of the way you're going to manage an automating modern infrastructure. So Ansible especially is in many of those same deal. OpenStack and OpenShift is kind of a mix often OpenShift will run on top of OpenStack, but some of the largest deals that I mentioned are over telco deals that were just OpenStack. One of those big top four was OpenShift running on OpenStack just kind of looking down. It really is a mix. So they are often sold together because you got to have a deployment target for OpenShift. The sale point we use over-and-over again is you can run it on Amazon, you can run it on Azure, you can run it on VMware, you can run it on OpenStack and it really is a mix. In this quarter, actually a fair number of the OpenShift deals also weighed in on OpenStack. So there's a reasonable amount of cross sell there. Ben McFadden Great. Thank you. Tom McCallum Great. Next question, please. Operator Next we'll go to Abhey Lamba with Mizuho Securities. Abhey Lamba Yes, thank you. Great quarter. Jim as you are signing these mega deals. Can you talk what it was in the marketplace in fiscal '17 that drove such an acceleration in number of large teams and their sizes? We saw this big uptick in last year in fiscal '15 and this year seems to be another big step up. What's driving this acceleration? Jim Whitehurst I think its couple of things. One is often times those include OpenStack or OpenShift, which are just a very - they do a lot more than our independent technology in terms of the size and scope of the customer problems they address. So there are higher price points and so those deals get to be larger as people are putting those in their infrastructure. Second one is just as enterprises are accelerating their application migration to more modern architecture there is a need for the technologies to help them do that. So the largest $100 million deal, really that was our middleware portfolio, but a lot of that with the customer looking to migrate from some of their traditional heavyweight JEE stuff to our portfolio to save money. But also make it easier to land that on more modern platform. So I guess, more and more enterprises are saying, “Oh, I may want to use public cloud in the future. I want to use it now”. There now have a bunch of applications that are capable of running on a public cloud. So they need to partner with someone like Red Hat who can get those applications without massive modifications on scale out infrastructure. And those deals just become bigger because of the size of the value and the scope of the technologies involved. Tom McCallum Hi everyone. I'm afraid, we have time for one more question. I want to apologize on behalf of the team here apparently we had some service provide issue. So we will try to follow-up with everybody who has additional questions. I'm afraid for the official call, we have a hard stop at six. So we have time for one more operator. Operator And we'll go to Siti Panigrahi with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Siti Panigrahi Thanks for taking my question. It's good to see such a large number of $5 million plus deals. And also you talked about five or more technology in half of the deals include. Just wondering if you could give some color about storage business. We heard about CCSP [ph] a couple of years ago it was getting good traction, I'm wondering at what percentage of your emerging technology now storage and what's your expectation going forward. Jim Whitehurst So, let me give a little bit of contact. I think in terms of standalone storage five deals had standalone storage components in that top 30 deals. But just a little bit of contact there, we see CCSP [ph] project sold often with OpenStack and Gluster and much of the Gluster roadmap is around adding capability into OpenShift. So we can talk about standalone storage and again there were five deals that had standalone storage components in there. But it's a pretty important part of both our OpenStack and our OpenShift products as we are needing to offer whether it's state in OpenShift or broadly easy access to storage in OpenStack. So again, five on a standalone basis. But those technologies are wrapped in the OpenShift and OpenStack components of our business and one of the reasons that those businesses are growing so nicely. Tom McCallum Great. Operator, that's all the time we have today. I want to thank everyone for joining us. We will try to reach out to everybody. If there are any additional questions, feel free to reach out to Sarah and I and we'll try to get back to you as soon as possible. We also have Analyst Day coming up in early May and if you haven't been invited and you want to come, please let us know as well. Thank you everyone for your time.

The call will begin with prepared comments by management followed by a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  Before we get started, on behalf of Ross Stores, I would like to note that the comments made on this call will contain forward-looking statements regarding expectations of their future growth and financial results including sales and earnings forecasts and other matters that are based on the company's current forecast of aspects of its future business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical performance or current expectations. Risk factors are included in today's press release and the company's fiscal 2016 Form 10-K and fiscal 2017 Form 8-Ks on file with the SEC. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Barbara Rentler, Chief Executive Officer. Barbara Rentler Good afternoon. Joining me on our call today are Michael Balmuth, Executive Chairman; Michael O'Sullivan, President and Chief Operating Officer; Gary Cribb, Executive Vice President, Stores and Loss Prevention; John Call, Executive Vice President, Finance and Legal; Michael Hartshorn, Group Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Connie Kao, Vice President, Investor Relations. We'll begin our call today with a review of our first quarter performance followed by our outlook for the second quarter and fiscal year. Afterwards, we'll be happy to respond to any questions you may have. As mentioned in our press release, we achieved respectable growth in both sales and earnings during the first quarter despite the uncertainty and volatility in the external environment. Earnings per share for the period were $0.82, up from $0.73 in the prior year.  Net earnings were $321 million, up from $291 million last year. First quarter sales increased 7% to $3.3 billion dollars with comparable store sales up 3%. Sales gains at Ross were broad based across most merchandise categories and geographic regions.  First quarter operating margin of 15.2% exceeded our expectations due to above-plan sales and merchandise margin. As we ended the first quarter, total consolidated inventories were up 6% versus the prior year with average in-store inventories down slightly. Packaway as a percent of total inventory was 46% similar to last year.  Despite challenging multi-year comparisons, D.D. dd's DISCOUNTS also saw a continued solid growth in same store sales and operating profits in the first quarter. Our store expansion program remains on track with the addition of 23 new Ross and five dd's DISCOUNTS stores in the first quarter. We are planning a total of 90 new locations in 2017 comprised of approximately 70 Ross and 20 dd's DISCOUNTS. As usual, these numbers do not reflect our plans to close or relocate of our 10 older stores during the year.  Now Michael Hartshorn will provide further color on our first quarter results and details on our second quarter guidance.  Michael Hartshorn Thank you, Barbara. Our 3% comparable store sales gain was driven by higher traffic as well as an increase in the size of the average basket. While first quarter operating margin of 15.2% decreased relative to last year’s 15.4%, it exceeded our expectations.  Cost of goods sold was flat for the quarter. Merchandise margins improved by 15 basis points while distribution and occupancy costs declined by 15 and 5 basis points respectively. These improvements were offset by a 35 basis point increase in freight expenses.  Selling, general, and administrative expenses during the period increased by 20 basis points mainly due to higher wages. Earnings per share for the quarter also benefited by $0.01 due to favorable expense timing that is expected to reverse in subsequent quarters.  During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.3 million shares for a total of $215 million. We remain on track to buy back as planned a total of $875 million in stock for the year, under the new two-year $1.75 billion program authorized by our Board of Directors in February of this year.  Let’s turn now to our second quarter guidance. For the second quarter ending July 29, 2017 we are forecasting same-store sales to be up 1% to 2% on top of a 4% gain last year with earnings per share of $0.73 to $0.76 compared to $0.71 last year.  Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the following assumptions: total sales are projected to increase 4% to 5%. We expect to open 28 new stores during the period, including 21 Ross and 7 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. Second quarter operating margin is projected to be 13.9% to 14.1%, down slightly from last year's 14.4% reflecting our forecast for higher freight costs and wage costs.  In addition, net interest expense for the quarter is estimated to be about $3 million. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 37% to 38% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding are projected to be about 387 million. Based on our first quarter results and second quarter guidance, we now project earnings per share for the 53 weeks ending February 3, 2018 to be in the range of $3.07 to $3.17 compared to $2.83 last year. As a reminder, our forecasted EPS for 2017 includes an approximate benefit of $0.08 per share from the 53 rd  week.  Now I'll turn the call back to Barbara for closing comments.  Barbara Rentler Thank you, Michael. As I said earlier, we had a solid first quarter despite the challenging external environment. Looking ahead we have plenty of liquidity and are open to buy to take advantage of the terrific opportunities in the marketplace and offer shoppers the best bargains possible. That said, we also face our own increasingly difficult prior year comparisons along with political macroeconomic and retail climates that are likely to remain uncertain. So while we hope to do better we are maintaining a somewhat cautious outlook for the balance of the year.  Over the longer term, we are confident the off-price sector will remain a strong performing segment of retail as consumers continue to seek value. In addition, we believe our operating strategies and ongoing investments in people, processes and system should enable us to drive respectable growth in both sales and earning in 2017 and beyond.  At this point, we’d like to open up the call and respond to any questions you might have.  Question-and-Answer Session Operator [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Lorraine Hutchinson  Thank you. Good afternoon Last year in the first quarter you had some challenges with the women's apparel business. Can you talk a little bit about how that performed and perhaps your learnings from last year and how you’ve made changes? And then lastly, what opportunities do you see for the second quarter in that division? Thank you.  Barbara Rentler Okay, ladies comparable sales for the first quarter were positive. We feel that the changes we made, we no longer have those lingering execution issues that we had last year and the challenges, we feel that those are behind us. We’ve made the appropriate changes, a lot of those issues were around seasonality and color and execution. So we feel that that we made progress during 2016 that we made additional progress in Q1 and that we’re going to continue to move forward. And there are opportunities as we improve our assortments in the second quarter.  Operator The next question is from Oliver Chen from Cowen.  Oliver Chen  The in-store inventories are really attractively down -- it really seems like there could be opportunities for you to explore optimization of space within your stores, or the new categories or continuing to enhance the cash drop. Could you speak to some guardrails or frameworks you're thinking about as you embark on just making sure you maximize the real estate space that you have, or what you'll think about square footage to maximize ROIC given that there could be some opportunities there? Thank you.  Michael O'Sullivan Oliver, it’s Michael O'Sullivan. It’s a good question because as you know over the last several years we've reduced average inventory in-store by about 40%. So this is a question we've actually been working on for some time and we've been using the extra space that we've created, if you like, in stores to really look at three things. One is make the stores easier to shop just by organizing the store in an easier shop way. Secondly, expanding into faster growing or new categories, and then thirdly, when it comes to new stores, be more flexible in terms of the store size of the new store openings. So I would say we’re actually pursuing a mix of all three in terms of, as you say, optimizing how we're using the space.  Operator Your next question is from Marni Shapiro from Retail Tracker.  Marni Shapiro  Hey everybody, congratulations on a great quarter, especially given the environment out there. As you guys are looking out, you’re one of the few opening stores still and there are a lot of people closing stores. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing on the rent and I guess even the relief side beyond 2017 and I suppose even part of 2018 for your stores?  Michael O'Sullivan Sure, Marni. We're very happy with the availability of the real estate locations that we've seeing. And if you will appreciate, typically the real estate locations we're seeing now really feed the pipeline for the next two or three years. So we're pretty happy with that outlook. As you say, there aren't many retailers out there who are opening 80 to 90 new stores a year. So therefore landlords are pretty happy to see us. We have a great real estate team, a great network and they have done a nice job of finding new locations.  In terms of rents and occupancy costs, we're certainly taking opportunities where they exist to negotiate and renegotiate those. But I would say that for the most part, rents and occupancy are fairly stable at this point. Operator The next question is from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.  Lindsay Drucker Mann  Thanks; good afternoon everyone. Coming off of the first quarter was especially challenging for a number of large retailers, department stores specifically with that negative traffic and tough comps. Barbara, can you talk about how that affects your business, what you're seeing in the marketplace or in your business that might be a spillover related to the broader macro? Barbara Rentler Sure. What we're seeing in the marketplace is there's a lot of availability. It's pretty broad based and as you know availability is often the result of department stores not making their plan in their forecast so that's the one thing we’d see in the immediate. In the future obviously it gives us an opportunity as the department store business is challenging to gain more market share.  Lindsay Drucker Mann  And if I could follow up, I think as we started -- as we exited in 4Q and you were looking at 1Q, you had a cautious tone given at what seemed to be a slower start to the quarter. Could you talk a bit about how the quarter played out and ultimately allowed you to beat your initial target? Michael Hartshorn Sure, Lindsay. In terms of trends during the quarter certainly like you saw I think across the retail landscape, sales strengthened as we moved through the quarter.  Operator The next question is from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley.  Kimberly Greenberger  Great, thanks so much. I was wondering, looking back to February, did you have any sort of impact on your business from the delay in tax refunds. And I wasn't sure if you might have had an opportunity to quantify that or not. And then Barbara, you talked about sales gains were relatively broad based across most merchandise categories and regions here in the first quarter. Were there areas where you saw some, let's say, improving momentum in your business where you see opportunity to really maximize in any of those categories as we go through the rest of the year? Thank you.  Michael Hartshorn Sure, Kimberly, it’s Michael Hartshorn. The delay in tax refunds, it certainly wasn't a positive for the quarter, the volatility made it a little bit more challenging to plan and operate the business. It's hard to say, though, if there was a negative impact to the overall quarter from the refunds. I'll give you some stats also on regional performance for us, Southeast, Florida and the Midwest were the top performing regions, the Midwest continues to be very strong region for us as it's been a top performing region for over three years. I’d call out other major markets; California was slightly below the chain average given the unfavorable weather with the storms during the quarter. Texas performed in line with the chain and that's an improvement from the second half of 2016 when it was below the chain average.  Barbara Rentler And then Kimberly in terms of areas that are improving the momentum, the sales really were pretty broad based throughout the company. Ladies continues to make progress, the ladies business is always a challenging business and there's really no major sales trends or the fashion trends out there unless you really have weather to drive it particularly in Q1, ladies continues to be a challenge, but we do feel like we're improving on our execution and so we continue to do -- we need to do, our expectation is better, we would improve it as we get into the second quarter but again there is -- one of the real problems in ladies is there is no real overriding fashion trends to drive it.  Operator The next question is from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim. Bob Drbul  I was just wondering there's a lot of discussion around certain vendors that are trying to pull back from the off-price channel, and are you seeing any of that in your discussions and can you maybe just talk to any other new brand opportunities that you're seeing or categories that are becoming more available to you? Barbara Rentler Sure. Yes, I know there's been a lot of discussion about vendors wanting to pull back. But we haven't really seen that. We continue to see plenty of branded bargains in the marketplace and quite frankly vendors have strategies that have fluctuated over time and we do business with over 8000 vendors so we've been able to successfully navigate over the years through all of these changes.  In terms of new brands, we really wouldn't talk about brands, specific brands on the call and same thing pretty much for new categories where we are testing.  Operator The next question is from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup.  Paul Lejuez  Can you talk about how wages impacted your earnings growth this quarter versus what you expect over the next several quarters and even looking out beyond 2017? Thanks.  Michael Hartshorn Sure, Paul. We expect wages to abate in the second half of the year as we anniversary the most recent wage increases that took place in last year's second quarter for us. So our guidance, though, still for the year assumes an SG&A leverage point at about 3% which is in line with historical averages.  Michael O'Sullivan Further out, I think you asked about beyond 2017, it’s hard for us to be precise beyond the current year, but we've taken the view that wage pressure is probably going to be around for the next several years. Certainly in some of the major states that we're in as legislation that's already been passed that pushes up the minimum wage over the next several years. So we're expecting continued wage pressure but it's hard to be precise about that.  Paul Lejuez  I think you guys are looking for a flattish merch margin for the year. Has the first quarter experienced or buying environment changed that view at all? Just curious what your outlook is on merch margin specifically.  Michael Hartshorn No, we haven't changed our outlook, Paul, even though we exceeded merch margins by 15 basis points during the quarter, though that was primarily driven by above plan sales which allowed us to leverage markdowns and drive the business with close-outs. Just after one quarter we wouldn’t change our outlook for the year.  Operator The next question is from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.  Matthew Boss  So I guess just to piggyback on that, as we think about the gross margin line longer term, you've taken the inventory down 40% as you outlined. Do you see further opportunity on the inventory front and is it best to think about at this level of comp flattish gross margins as a whole? And then just one micro on the freight, what is the headwind, what's the magnitude in the second quarter? I know you outlined that. Michael Hartshorn So we didn't say specifically on the basis point impact though, beginning in Q4 we did -- have seen a tightening of carrier rates as well as fuel costs that are up against some very low levels last year. Right now we expect freight cost to be a headwind for the remainder of the year and that's reflected in our guidance.  Michael O'Sullivan In terms of your question about the outlook for gross margin, there are really three things that have helped us drive gross margin improvement over the past several years. The inventory reductions we've taken have obviously helped us to drive down markdowns that's been an important component. Improvements in our shortage control, the investments we've made there again have helped to drive up gross margin. And then the third component has been ahead of plan sales driving obviously ahead of plan terms. As we look forward, of those three, I think there's limited opportunity left in the first two, the inventory reduction and the shortage control. We'll continue to manage those tightly but I think realistically there's a limit to what more we can do. So most of the growth on gross margin going forward is going to have to come from the sales line in terms of ahead of plan sales.  Operator The next question is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research.  Adrienne Yih Tennant  Good afternoon and I'll add my congratulations, nicely done. My question is on the home category. I was wondering there's obviously some of your competitors are expanding into that category more aggressively and actually wanting a secondary concept here in the United States. I was wondering what your plans are with your home sales. You obviously have a better quarter, your sales coming from there, if you can help us with the strategy there. Thank you very much. Barbara Rentler Sure. Home has actually been one of our strongest categories over the last couple of years and we believe that there is further opportunity to grow the business. But for competitive reasons we wouldn't disclose the specific target.  Operator The next question is from David Mann from Johnson Rice.  David Mann  Question about your distribution centers, you made a lot of investment I guess in the last couple of years. You're starting to see some benefit. Where are you in terms of the opportunity to leverage those investments and improve productivity? How much longer do you think you can get gains there? Michael Hartshorn Sure, David. So in the first quarter DC is levered by about 15 basis points and that was all due to both efficiencies in the DCs and also fixed cost leverage. So we would certainly over the next couple years expect to see – add some ability to lever the fixed costs there as we don't expect additional significant investments for the next couple of years.  Operator The next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.  Laura Champine  Thanks for taking my question. In California where you’ve got your highest density of stores, do you think that market is maturing? And along those lines as we look at next year store openings, will those be more focused in the Midwest or other lesser penetrated markets? Michael Hartshorn In terms of California, we continue to see comps there certainly over the last couple years, I mean we've obviously been in the market for thirty years and we continue to comp. So we continue to believe we have the opportunity to comp stores there.  Michael O'Sullivan In terms of the breakdown of our new store openings, I don't think that's going to change materially. I mean, from year to year you could see a small adjustment. But I don't expect to see a material change. So the way to think about it is about a third of our new stores, more or less are in the Midwest, about a third are in sort of existing, if you like, Ross markets outside the Midwest. And then the remainder are dd's new openings.  Operator The next question is from Brian Tunick from RBC.  Brian Tunick  I was curious regarding your stores located near the liquidation areas of Macy's or Sears and Kmart. Just any comments regarding how your stores performed in those areas and have you thought about doing any kind of proactive marketing events with what J.C. Penney will be doing coming up in the second quarter? Thanks very much.  Michael Hartshorn Sure, Brian. The closures were fairly recent and late in the quarter, so the impact would have been barely minor to the quarter. Over the long term, though, fewer stores, fewer competitors certainly create more market share opportunities for us which should be a positive factor for the business.  Operator The next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.  Ike Boruchow  Michael, just to close the loop on gross margin, I mean the compares get a little bit more difficult as the year progresses. How should we -- is there anything we should keep in mind in our models on the gross margin line and do you expect flat to up the remainder of the year? And is there something embedded in your fiscal year guide just on the gross margin line? Just to help us out. Michael Hartshorn No, I wouldn't change anything that we said in our initial call, Ike, earlier in the year that we expect going into the year that we expected merchandise margins to be relatively flat. And to call out at this point that we think freight will be a headwind to the remainder of the year.  Ike Boruchow  [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.  Michael Baker  I wanted to ask about the online competition and I think it's clear that you guys are taking share from department stores and online may not be impacting you, you can see the comp. I guess how do you know that your customers wouldn’t buy from you online? What have you done to ask your customers, perhaps you’re losing some share or leaving some sales on the table without the online? But I know economically it doesn't work right for you but are your customers demanding it at all? Michael O'Sullivan We haven't had any -- we certainly haven't had any communication from customers that they are demanding e-commerce from Ross, and that's mainly because of the type of business we run. I mean it's important to keep in mind we're a moderate off-priced retailer, a low average unit retail round about $10. So as you mentioned, Mike, the economics really don't work. We offer a very broad assortment which again is hard to replicate online and a treasure hunt environment which again is very difficult to replicate outside of a bricks and mortar format. So overall we feel like it's very difficult for an online retailer even if that retailer was us, to sort of compete with what we offer in our stores. That's not to say that it's not important for us to monitor what's going on online and to monitor online competitors and we do that all the time.  Michael Baker  If I could just follow up, so you said you haven't had any communication with your customers. But have you asked them, in what way would you ask your customers, I guess if we did have an online site, is that something that would be attractive to you? Michael O'Sullivan I think it is hard to know how you would actually get asked that question other than looking at our business, and if we saw our business start to fall off and we diagnosed that and found the customers were buying online rather than coming into our stores, buying online from other people rather than coming into my stores, I mean that would be a clear indicator for us. Clearly based on the strength of our business we're not seeing that trend.  Operator Your next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura/Instinet.  Simeon Siegel  Has the concentration of your top vendors changed at all over the past year or so? Do you expect any shift in their percentage composition going forward? And then just to your point about the macro challenges and tougher compares, any color on what you'd expect the comp cadence to look like in the back half? Thanks.  Barbara Rentler On the concentration of top vendors, I would say probably similar year over year without having that exact number in front of me. The supply lines have been pretty broad based development but I think that there aren't any real challenges there. And can you just repeat the second part of the question on the macro economics –  Simeon Siegel  Yes, just thinking -- what you expect the comp cadence to look like in the back half, I think at the end of your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned the tougher compares and just the macro environment for the rest of the year.  Michael Hartshorn No, we will give – we will update the back half comp when we give our release in August. I’ll just you to, when we started the year we expected one to two, so it would be pretty similar across the rest of the year.  Operator And next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.  Dana Telsey  As you are thinking about inventory, how do you think about the composition of packaways going forward and what your outlook is for it? And then when you think about real estate costs and new store openings, given the current real estate environment, is rental cost or lease expense at all more flexible today than it was in the past? Thank you.  Barbara Rentler I’ll talk about packaway first. So in terms of packaway going forward, packaway are our opportunistic purchases, so it’s kind of hard to predict where the packaway will come from or what the composition will be. What I would say is that the criteria for putting goods into pathway, the values that we want to put out later on in the year after we sell the goods, is really the main criteria. So it's kind of really hard to predict the classifications or the amount quite, frankly, it fluctuates.  Michael O'Sullivan And then on the second question, Dana, on real estate. I would say truth is that store closures in the strip mall environment have been a feature for several years now, whether it's office supply retailers or sporting goods retailers or electronics retailers going out of business. So I would say that it's really more of the same right now. I would say that rental costs and occupancy costs have stabilized but I think a lot of the impact that you've seen from store closures has actually happened over the last few years.  Barbara Rentler And just to add one thing about packaway, we feel very good about the content of our current packaway that we own today.  Dana Telsey  And as you think about diversification of the merchandise mix, over the next few years what do you -- how do you see the mix diversifying?  Barbara Rentler Between the different types of products you mean, home –  Dana Telsey  Yes exactly.  Barbara Rentler But we feel good about home, we feel that we have growth at home but the past that I wouldn't talk about that on the call. What I would say is that we think there's opportunities broad based throughout the entire box. End of Q&A Operator There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.  Barbara Rentler Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day.

Has the first quarter experienced or buying environment changed that view at all? Just curious what your outlook is on merch margin specifically.  Michael Hartshorn No, we haven't changed our outlook, Paul, even though we exceeded merch margins by 15 basis points during the quarter, though that was primarily driven by above plan sales which allowed us to leverage markdowns and drive the business with close-outs. Just after one quarter we wouldn’t change our outlook for the year.  Operator The next question is from Matthew Boss from J.P. Morgan.  Matthew Boss  So I guess just to piggyback on that, as we think about the gross margin line longer term, you've taken the inventory down 40% as you outlined. Do you see further opportunity on the inventory front and is it best to think about at this level of comp flattish gross margins as a whole? And then just one micro on the freight, what is the headwind, what's the magnitude in the second quarter? I know you outlined that. Michael Hartshorn So we didn't say specifically on the basis point impact though, beginning in Q4 we did -- have seen a tightening of carrier rates as well as fuel costs that are up against some very low levels last year. Right now we expect freight cost to be a headwind for the remainder of the year and that's reflected in our guidance.  Michael O'Sullivan In terms of your question about the outlook for gross margin, there are really three things that have helped us drive gross margin improvement over the past several years. The inventory reductions we've taken have obviously helped us to drive down markdowns that's been an important component. Improvements in our shortage control, the investments we've made there again have helped to drive up gross margin. And then the third component has been ahead of plan sales driving obviously ahead of plan terms. As we look forward, of those three, I think there's limited opportunity left in the first two, the inventory reduction and the shortage control. We'll continue to manage those tightly but I think realistically there's a limit to what more we can do. So most of the growth on gross margin going forward is going to have to come from the sales line in terms of ahead of plan sales.  Operator The next question is from Adrienne Yih from Wolfe Research.  Adrienne Yih Tennant  Good afternoon and I'll add my congratulations, nicely done. My question is on the home category. I was wondering there's obviously some of your competitors are expanding into that category more aggressively and actually wanting a secondary concept here in the United States. I was wondering what your plans are with your home sales. You obviously have a better quarter, your sales coming from there, if you can help us with the strategy there. Thank you very much. Barbara Rentler Sure. Home has actually been one of our strongest categories over the last couple of years and we believe that there is further opportunity to grow the business. But for competitive reasons we wouldn't disclose the specific target.  Operator The next question is from David Mann from Johnson Rice.  David Mann  Question about your distribution centers, you made a lot of investment I guess in the last couple of years. You're starting to see some benefit. Where are you in terms of the opportunity to leverage those investments and improve productivity? How much longer do you think you can get gains there? Michael Hartshorn Sure, David. So in the first quarter DC is levered by about 15 basis points and that was all due to both efficiencies in the DCs and also fixed cost leverage. So we would certainly over the next couple years expect to see – add some ability to lever the fixed costs there as we don't expect additional significant investments for the next couple of years.  Operator The next question is from Laura Champine from Roe Equity Research.  Laura Champine  Thanks for taking my question. In California where you’ve got your highest density of stores, do you think that market is maturing? And along those lines as we look at next year store openings, will those be more focused in the Midwest or other lesser penetrated markets? Michael Hartshorn In terms of California, we continue to see comps there certainly over the last couple years, I mean we've obviously been in the market for thirty years and we continue to comp. So we continue to believe we have the opportunity to comp stores there.  Michael O'Sullivan In terms of the breakdown of our new store openings, I don't think that's going to change materially. I mean, from year to year you could see a small adjustment. But I don't expect to see a material change. So the way to think about it is about a third of our new stores, more or less are in the Midwest, about a third are in sort of existing, if you like, Ross markets outside the Midwest. And then the remainder are dd's new openings.  Operator The next question is from Brian Tunick from RBC.  Brian Tunick  I was curious regarding your stores located near the liquidation areas of Macy's or Sears and Kmart. Just any comments regarding how your stores performed in those areas and have you thought about doing any kind of proactive marketing events with what J.C. Penney will be doing coming up in the second quarter? Thanks very much.  Michael Hartshorn Sure, Brian. The closures were fairly recent and late in the quarter, so the impact would have been barely minor to the quarter. Over the long term, though, fewer stores, fewer competitors certainly create more market share opportunities for us which should be a positive factor for the business.  Operator The next question is from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo.  Ike Boruchow  Michael, just to close the loop on gross margin, I mean the compares get a little bit more difficult as the year progresses. How should we -- is there anything we should keep in mind in our models on the gross margin line and do you expect flat to up the remainder of the year? And is there something embedded in your fiscal year guide just on the gross margin line? Just to help us out. Michael Hartshorn No, I wouldn't change anything that we said in our initial call, Ike, earlier in the year that we expect going into the year that we expected merchandise margins to be relatively flat. And to call out at this point that we think freight will be a headwind to the remainder of the year.  Ike Boruchow  [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.  Michael Baker  I wanted to ask about the online competition and I think it's clear that you guys are taking share from department stores and online may not be impacting you, you can see the comp. I guess how do you know that your customers wouldn’t buy from you online? What have you done to ask your customers, perhaps you’re losing some share or leaving some sales on the table without the online? But I know economically it doesn't work right for you but are your customers demanding it at all? Michael O'Sullivan We haven't had any -- we certainly haven't had any communication from customers that they are demanding e-commerce from Ross, and that's mainly because of the type of business we run. I mean it's important to keep in mind we're a moderate off-priced retailer, a low average unit retail round about $10. So as you mentioned, Mike, the economics really don't work. We offer a very broad assortment which again is hard to replicate online and a treasure hunt environment which again is very difficult to replicate outside of a bricks and mortar format. So overall we feel like it's very difficult for an online retailer even if that retailer was us, to sort of compete with what we offer in our stores. That's not to say that it's not important for us to monitor what's going on online and to monitor online competitors and we do that all the time.  Michael Baker  If I could just follow up, so you said you haven't had any communication with your customers. But have you asked them, in what way would you ask your customers, I guess if we did have an online site, is that something that would be attractive to you? Michael O'Sullivan I think it is hard to know how you would actually get asked that question other than looking at our business, and if we saw our business start to fall off and we diagnosed that and found the customers were buying online rather than coming into our stores, buying online from other people rather than coming into my stores, I mean that would be a clear indicator for us. Clearly based on the strength of our business we're not seeing that trend.  Operator Your next question is from Simeon Siegel from Nomura/Instinet.  Simeon Siegel  Has the concentration of your top vendors changed at all over the past year or so? Do you expect any shift in their percentage composition going forward? And then just to your point about the macro challenges and tougher compares, any color on what you'd expect the comp cadence to look like in the back half? Thanks.  Barbara Rentler On the concentration of top vendors, I would say probably similar year over year without having that exact number in front of me. The supply lines have been pretty broad based development but I think that there aren't any real challenges there. And can you just repeat the second part of the question on the macro economics –  Simeon Siegel  Yes, just thinking -- what you expect the comp cadence to look like in the back half, I think at the end of your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned the tougher compares and just the macro environment for the rest of the year.  Michael Hartshorn No, we will give – we will update the back half comp when we give our release in August. I’ll just you to, when we started the year we expected one to two, so it would be pretty similar across the rest of the year.  Operator And next question is from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.  Dana Telsey  As you are thinking about inventory, how do you think about the composition of packaways going forward and what your outlook is for it? And then when you think about real estate costs and new store openings, given the current real estate environment, is rental cost or lease expense at all more flexible today than it was in the past? Thank you.  Barbara Rentler I’ll talk about packaway first. So in terms of packaway going forward, packaway are our opportunistic purchases, so it’s kind of hard to predict where the packaway will come from or what the composition will be. What I would say is that the criteria for putting goods into pathway, the values that we want to put out later on in the year after we sell the goods, is really the main criteria. So it's kind of really hard to predict the classifications or the amount quite, frankly, it fluctuates.  Michael O'Sullivan And then on the second question, Dana, on real estate. I would say truth is that store closures in the strip mall environment have been a feature for several years now, whether it's office supply retailers or sporting goods retailers or electronics retailers going out of business. So I would say that it's really more of the same right now. I would say that rental costs and occupancy costs have stabilized but I think a lot of the impact that you've seen from store closures has actually happened over the last few years.  Barbara Rentler And just to add one thing about packaway, we feel very good about the content of our current packaway that we own today.  Dana Telsey  And as you think about diversification of the merchandise mix, over the next few years what do you -- how do you see the mix diversifying?  Barbara Rentler Between the different types of products you mean, home –  Dana Telsey  Yes exactly.  Barbara Rentler But we feel good about home, we feel that we have growth at home but the past that I wouldn't talk about that on the call. What I would say is that we think there's opportunities broad based throughout the entire box. End of Q&A Operator There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Barbara Rentler for closing comments.  Barbara Rentler Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Ross Stores. Have a great day.

Simpson - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Michael O\'Leary And you\'re very welcome to the Ryanair Half Year Investor Conference Call. I\'m here with my colleagues, our new Chief Financial Officer, Neil Sorahan; and David O\'Brien, our Chief Commercial Officer. We\'re being joined from New York by Howard Millar and Kenny Jacobs. I will run through the quick summary of the details. We\'ve put out the press release, and the investor presentation is on the ryanair.com website this morning. We\'ll give you some brief comments on that, and then I\'ll ask Neil to add some comments on the financial side. David has some comments on the commercial side and commercial development. And then we\'ll open it up for Q&A. So as you\'ve seen this morning, we reported very strong half year numbers. Profits were up 32% to EUR 795 million, a combination of traffic growth, load factor growth and average fares rising by 4%, 5% in first half of the year. At the same time, unit costs fell, including fuel. Excluding fuel, they rose by 3% in the half year. But we expect that over the full year, they will be flat excluding fuel and will fall by 4% including fuel for the full year. As a result, a very strong performance, most of which is due to the strategy we launched at September of being more aggressive with forward price and taking forward of our forward bookings. We\'ve seen fuller flights, stronger load factors and much better performance. The customers who are flying with us are also enjoying the improvements that we\'ve headed with our group together, under the Always Getting Better program. That seemed to significantly improve almost every aspect of the customer experience at Ryanair from every touch point. So from the point where they originally go on the website, which has significantly improved, new mobile app, a lot easier at check-in, most of the check-in being done online. The boarding gate is a much more relaxed environment now because of the allocated seating. We\'re no longer fighting with passengers over the size of their bags. And onboard, our crews and passengers are enjoying that better experience. So we\'ve seen a lot of positive developments. And there is a lot of momentum in the business as we move into the second half of the year. As a result of that, we\'ve taken up both traffic guidance for the second half of the year. We expect -- we added some capacity in the winter. We\'ve also taken up the load factors. What\'s most reassuring at the moment is that the forward booking profile, which has been running 5% ahead of where we were last year through the summer, it looks like it will continue through the winter as well. Currently, today, we\'re 5 percentage points on average ahead of where we were last year in November, December, January, February and March despite the fact that from November onwards, the capacity will increase by about 16%. On top of that, the other key developments in the second half of the year has been the launch of new services, the Family Extra product has gone very well, the Business Plus product. The bonds of our first successful eurobond, EUR 850 million over a 7-year period at less than 2%. The board has approved or the AGM has approved the special dividend with all EUR 520 million, which will be payable at the end of February. And we have, I think, clarified our growth prospects for the next 10 years with the September order for 200 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. That will allow us -- give us the capacity in a controlled manner to grow from 80 million passengers last year to over 150 million passengers over the next 10 years. We\'ll be doing that with a higher forward bookings, stronger load factors and a much better customer experience as the Always Getting Better program continues to deliver. In terms of new bases and new route development, again I\'ll ask David to touch on it, but it continues to be very strong. The 4 new summer bases, all at primary airports in Athens, Brussels, Lisbon and Rome, have done extraordinarily well, high load factors. Initially, we started off with relatively low yields as we broke into the market, but the yields rose quickly during the summer period. Forward bookings on the 4 new winter bases in Glasgow International, Cologne, Gdansk and Warsaw are also building quickly. And we\'re excited to report that success. A lot of the winter capacity is also going to take place by building out schedules, business-type schedules, on European city international routes and on domestic routes. We\'ve used the example here in the U.K., where we\'ve entered Glasgow International and moved this winter. That\'s given us an opportunity to enter the Glasgow-London market with 3 times daily flights. Having entered the Glasgow-London market, we\'ve also entered the Edinburgh-London market with 3 times daily flights, undercoursing both easyJet and BA by up to 50%. And we\'ve seen a surge in passengers and bookings on those domestic routes as we significantly lowered the cost for business people flying between Dublin -- between Edinburgh, Glasgow and London. On top of that, we\'re making it easier for business people to -- business passengers to interact with Ryanair. We\'ve extended the GDS distribution from Galileo and Worldspan now to Amadeus. So we\'re visible on about 95% of Europe\'s corporate GDS booking screens. And we expect, therefore, that the number of the percentage of business passengers switching to Ryanair through a combination of better visibility present at the primary airport and improved schedule this winter will continue to pay benefits. Fuel. We\'ve taken advantage of the weaker fuel environment in the last couple of months to hedge forward out to March 2016. We\'ve now hedged out to 90% to March 2016 at about $93 a barrel. We expect that, that will lock away not just cost certainty but slightly lower unit costs for this year, the remainder of this year and next year. We will take up some of the lower spot prices with the 10% of the fuel that is unhedged. As a result of all that progress over the last 6 months, we closed out September with a very strong balance sheet. Our cash balance, net cash has grown from EUR 150 million to over EUR 600 million during the 6 months despite paying -- spending nearly EUR 300 million on CapEx and repaying debt -- debt repayments of EUR 200 million. So we sit here today after a very strong first half, where I think the strategy we set out last September is working. The Always Getting Better program is delivering. As a result, we are raising the full year traffic guidance from 87 million to 89 passengers. That will represent 9% traffic growth over last year, where based on what visibility we have on Q3 yields at the moment, which is pretty good. We still have very limited yield visibility on Q4. We expect traffic in Q3 to grow by approximately 12%. Average fares to fall by between 3% and 5%, which is a slightly lower fall than the previous minus 6% to minus 8%. In the fourth quarter, with step-up capacity growth, we expect traffic to grow by 20% in the weaker fourth quarter. We may have to discount slightly more, so we expect average fares to fall by minus 6% to minus 8% in Q4. And if all that is -- if that guidance, the yields, the guidance is accurate into Q4, that means we should significantly raise the full year profit guidance now. So we\'ve taken that up from a figure of about EUR 650 million after tax to a new range of EUR 750 million to EUR 770 million, midpoint of about EUR 760 million, which represents 45% profit growth over last year. I would caution, particularly for the analysts, that those are very ambitious targets. We don\'t want people running mad. The business is performing very well. The profits are growing strongly. But we need to control some of the irrational exuberance as well. With that, I\'m going to hand over to Neil to give you a quick commentary on the financial numbers for the half year, and then I\'ll ask David to update you on some commercial insights. Neil? Neil Sorahan Thank you, Michael. We\'ve had a very solid first half of the year and we saw traffic increase by 4% to 51 million passengers, which was driven by the high increase in load factor, where we grew our load factor from 85% to 89%. Average fare was up by 5%, EUR 54. Total revenue, just over EUR 3.5 billion, and net profits, up 32% to EUR 795 million, giving us a net margin of 23%. The balance sheet is in particularly strong shape, as Michael alluded to earlier on. We\'ve seen our net cash position increase from EUR 158 million at year-end to EUR 618 million now. And we expect to be in a net cash position at year-end after a EUR 520 million dividend in February. Pass it over to David. Michael O\'Leary David, your comments on the commercial developments? David O\'Brien Yes. Thank you, Michael. This winter sees a very different winter schedule for Ryanair with a lot of growth on -- in fact, most of our growth divided between increased domestic frequencies and increased international frequencies, associated also with our new bases in Cologne, Gdansk, Glasgow and Warsaw. The schedule has been reshaped to support higher load factors and a more stable schedule through the winter. So if you take Q4, Q4\'s growth is largely a continuation of the new high-frequency routes from Q3, whereas before, it might have been flexed through increasing or reducing leisure routes. Our focus on domestic frequencies will be in Italy, Scotland, Poland and Portugal, where the airports in each of those countries are concerned at reductions by Alitalia in the first instance, underperformance by Eurolot and easyJet\'s current disinterest in Scotland at this point. So all of these new routes are pinned on new deals at these airports. And again, we are supporting our business products with increased international frequencies between the main cities, starting initially with Dublin and Stansted, into the largest cities, Rome, Madrid, Barcelona, et cetera. Another feature of this winter schedule is that we put it on sale some several months earlier. And in fact, we\'re working on winter \'15 right now and in discussions with a lot of airports to see what we\'ve done at the larger airports this winter and how one\'s become part of that game. So we\'re in discussion with more Scandinavian airports, more German airports with competition between them for a slice of our winter \'15 activities. Michael O\'Leary David, thank you very much. So with that, we\'re going to open it up to questions. If it\'s okay with those people who are on the phone, we\'ll take the questions in the room here first, where we have a group of analysts here in London. And then once we\'ve exhausted that, we\'ll open it up for our telephone questions. So if you just call out your name, ask the question. Question-and-Answer Session Jarrod Castle - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Michael, it\'s Jarrod Castle from UBS. Can you just give a bit of color in terms of the business products that came in relatively, I guess, late during the quarter? Can you talk a little bit about the takeup? I think maybe Howard has mentioned in the past, it could be 5% to 10% takeup there. And then also maybe just a bit of color in terms of what the takeup was on the Family product, which obviously came in a lot earlier for the summer period. Then just on fuel, obviously the per metric ton is down 2% year-over-year, given your hedging. But there will be some obviously efficiency with the new planes. So can you maybe give a bit of color in terms of how you see the total fuel goal for 2016? And then lastly, just on acquisitions, there was obviously a lot of talk about Cyprus. Anything happening on that front? Michael O\'Leary Thanks, Jarrod. I\'ll just take those. As the base -- I mean, the Family products took off like a rocket during the summer, primarily because there\'s lots of families traveling during the summer. We were discounting allocated seating, discounting the bag fee for families, children traveling as part of family groups. That was very successful. In percentage terms, it\'s not enormous. But I think it\'s part of the new Ryanair of communicating that we care about your family. We recognize that some of the additional fees are prohibitive if it\'s a family group of 3 or 4. And it certainly has been very well received by families traveling with us during the summer period. The business product was more a -- we expected we did kind of a quiet launch through the summer. The takeup -- remember, we\'ve got 25% of passengers traveling on business -- already traveling on business. The objective over a 3- to 5-year period is to see if we can convert about half of that 25%, so 10% or 12%, to paying us a premium for a package of services. The build at the moment in the summer is slow. It\'s low single digits. We would expect it to grow during the winter period. And again, it\'s one of the reasons, as David mentioned, why we\'ve specifically gone into certain markets, like the Glasgow there, London, Edinburgh-London. But also why we\'re fleshing out schedules, particularly from Dublin to the U.K. piece in London and from Stansted to European cities. So we\'d hoped to see it build to mid-single digits over the winter period. But I think it\'s a product that will build slowly as people -- more and more people become aware of it. Cyprus, we\'re into the second round of offers. The [indiscernible] process is a little bit chaotic down there partly because the Cypriot government are trying to deal with this state aid investigation by the European Union, which we believe is likely to rule Cyprus Airways did receive illegal state aid and therefore, must repay us. I again take the view we\'re unlikely to be the winners. I suspect it\'s also Aegean because Cypriot\'s camp has been told to pass it on to the Greeks. If it does go to Aegean, we would simply proceed with our application for a Cypriot AOC and we\'ll establish a Ryanair Cyprus operation, which would exploit some of the opportunities that undoubtedly exist and to rebuild traffic between the island of the Cyprus and a lot of those Middle Eastern destinations. And Neil, will you take the fuel question? Neil Sorahan Yes, sure. Jarrod, in relation to fuel, as you said yourself, we\'ve got less than 2% unit cost reductions into next year. We\'ve hedged to $930 per metric ton. We\'ve got the euro-dollar locked in at about 1.33. That\'s going to deliver 2% unit cost reduction. In relation to the new aircraft that are coming in, we started taking delivery of the 180 NG order. Those aircraft won\'t be hugely more efficient than aircraft that we already have. We\'ve updated most of our engines under the existing fleet with the tech insertions to get the maximum benefit from those engines. There will be a moderate fuel burn improvement. But the real change will come in 2019, when we start to take the MAX, which has got 18% unit -- 18% fuel burn efficiency over the NG. Oliver Sleath - Barclays Capital, Research Division It\'s Oliver Sleath from Barclays. Three questions, please. Firstly, on the ancillaries, can you talk your latest review on that? I think we were assuming flat at the moment. I\'m interested to know if things like the Business Plus, does any of that get accounted in ancillaries or not if I just roll in the base? Secondly, on the primary airports, obviously you have some of the primaries, like Rome, going for a little while now. So I guess, a question for David is, I mean, are you actually seeing a higher average fare in the primary airports now versus your sort of underlying secondary airport mix? Or is it just more in the load factor still? And then thirdly, how much of the growth this winter is actually going to be pure frequency versus new routes? David O\'Brien Putting them in reverse order, I would say about 50%, maybe 60% is increased frequency through the course of this winter, certainly the existing routes, such as Dublin and Stansted, the remainder is new, and new high frequency, if you take Glasgow and Edinburgh into London. In terms of the primary airports, we\'re encouraged by what we see. Every -- the load factors have been excellent and the start of the yields are growing in the direction we would like them to grow. There is competition, but the evidence seems to be that the competition are losing enthusiasm. And if you take Brussels, you don\'t hear Vueling say anything about Brussels anymore. One could expect to retreat there, I imagine. Michael O\'Leary And on the third part, ancillaries, we would expect the ancillaries be flat over the year, whoever\'s next has got to keep it moving. Ancillaries, we expect to be generally flat over the next year. As you can see, the allocated seating is making up for a lot of the fee reductions, the airport and baggage fee reductions, which is a good performance. And we would expect that to continue. To the extent that Business Plus, as there\'s a pickup in Business Plus, some of the ancillary revenue will move above the line into yields because we\'ll be including some of those services, such as the reserve seating, the free bag, would actually go up into yields. So I think the objective, if we can continue to keep ancillaries growing at the same rate as headline traffic growth, I think we would be pleased with that performance. Stephen Furlong? Stephen Furlong - Davy, Research Division Yes. Stephen Furlong from Davy. Just a couple of quick ones. In terms of the forward bookings, Michael, does that help in giving you greater visibility in terms of where you could see yields going. Presumably even with those forward bookings, it gives you some idea of Q3, but it\'s still well too early to know where Q4 is going to be. Just my comment on that. And for Dave, I was wondering, in terms of the frequencies that you\'ve added since the last quarter, has it been in some of these domestic routes, where you\'re seeing you\'re booked up very well? Or you\'ve obviously added somewhere. Maybe give an example where you\'ve just bumped up the frequencies, that will be good. And then you might just talk just quickly, I noticed you announced a base in Copenhagen. You\'ve looked at that before. Maybe just what your views about what\'s going on in Scandinavian markets. And is there a lot of interest there from airports, please? Michael O\'Leary Yes. I think I\'ve been nervous on the forward bookings. The forward bookings are very strong. But ultimately, the final yield is determined by the close-in bookings. All I can say at this point in time, that for the last number of months and again in September and again in October, we have been pleasantly surprised by the strength of the close-in bookings and the strength of the yields at close-in bookings even as we are taking out lower fares because the load factors are rising. There seems to be no resistance to people closer in paying the higher fares. Now I ascribe some of that to the fact that actually the competition is just pushing or trying to push up fares even higher. And so in essence, they\'re sending traffic in our direction. There\'s no doubt we\'ve been helped by almost continuous cycle of industrial relations problems among other airlines, strikes in Aer Lingus, TAP pilot strike for 4 days, Lufthansa, Air France, et cetera. But there does seem to be an underlying momentum in the business at the moment that I thought would dip as we went into the winter. And thus far, although still little bit early, it doesn\'t seem to be dipping. I don\'t think that gives me great confidence on our visibility into the final yields for Q3 or Q4. As you can see in our guidance, we still expect the yields to dip. We continue to be pleasantly surprised. I think the real objective though is that through this winter is to push out lost capacity, grab a lot of market share, even if we do so by cutting prices during the winter. We will emerge into the H1 of 2016 or next year\'s summer peak with so much forward momentum in such a good shape in a lot of these market bases, particularly as the word gets out that Ryanair is changing, it\'s not steep enough anymore, it\'s cheap and very good and the experience is excellent. I think that will have a lot of positive momentum built in itself. So stronger forward bookings doesn\'t give us a lot of yield visibility, which is why the guidance has changed. So relatively rapidly in a relatively short period of time at the AGM at the end of September, we were still saying upper end of the [indiscernible] EUR 650 million and why today, we\'re able to go, say, EUR 760 million with a reasonable degree of confidence. But I don\'t think it\'s going to go much above that. There will be some analysts out there going, "Oh, let\'s stick an EUR 800 million number on it." It won\'t -- I don\'t think it\'ll be EUR 800 million because I still expect, given the capacity additions we\'re going to be making this winter, that it will come in still somewhere below EUR 800 million. I think the guidance we\'re giving now with reasonable visibility in Q3 should be fairly accurate. But I hope I continue to be positively surprised. David, do you want to touch on the frequency additions in Copenhagen? David O\'Brien Sure. So we launched a lot of our domestic routes this summer, if we take routes in Poland and in Portugal. In fact, we were aware at the time that we didn\'t have enough frequencies. So what we\'re doing now is adding sufficient frequency to give a decent schedule. If you take Gdansk and Brussels up to Warsaw, we were running 1 a day, we\'re now running 2 a day. And ultimately, we can see that go to 3 or 4. Clearly 1 a day isn\'t an adequate schedule, so we\'re down to 2. Similarly, with Lisbon in Portugal, it was 1 a day [indiscernible] and it will inevitably grow into perhaps winter \'15. Stansted-Glasgow, Stansted-Edinburgh, that\'s from 0 up to 3. And that\'s on foot of exceptional enthusiasm by both Glasgow Airport and Edinburgh Airport for growth, which they\'re not seeing the way they expected before from other carriers. So it\'s part of the growth deal there and it\'s an excellent utilization for our aircraft, also supports our business product and feeds into a very substantial route network at Stansted. Informally, it could be a lot of -- more self-connected [indiscernible]. And finally, in Italy, as in Alitalia, they\'re 1 reduced, we\'re simply adding there, taking the opportunity to take Rome Fiumicino to Catania or to Palermo. That represents us filling a gap being vacated by Air One and Alitalia. With respect to Scandinavia, I think our announcement in Copenhagen has created a lot of reaction within the other Scandinavian cities, which recognize that their overreliance on -- if you take Norwegian\'s own results, they\'ve described themselves as make or break and described -- in their own presentation, described SAS as need government bailout. When you consider that 80% of Orlando [ph] is either needs government bailouts or is make or break, you can understand there. And we are the only people now that can help them out. So those conversations are ongoing. They\'re ongoing for winter \'15, which gives us quite an amount of time to pick and choose. Meanwhile, we have the other parts of the network, take the Eastern Mediterranean, with its own demand for our deliveries. Michael O\'Leary I think Jack is next. Jack Diskin - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Just 2 questions for me this morning. Firstly, in relation to the percentage growth in average fare during Q2, how much do you attribute that to improvement in underlying trading versus, I guess, FX movements during the period? And secondly, just on sector length, with the increased focus on domestic line, how do you see this evolving into H2 \'15 and possibly in FY \'16 in terms of a percentage reduction year-on-year? Neil Sorahan Well, in relation to the average fare, approximately 1% of that will be related to FX, primarily on sterling. Now with a natural hedge in relation to sterling, where we offset our cost against our revenues, you could -- will contribute about 1%, 1.5% to Easter [ph] and the rest is on underlying trading within business. Jack Diskin - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division And tax events? Neil Sorahan Tax events for the full year will be broadly flat. It was up -- sorry, it was down 1% in the first half and we\'re expecting this to be broadly flat for the full year. Jack Diskin - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Into next year? Neil Sorahan Into next year, we haven\'t done the budget yet for next year. But based on the schedule, I think I wouldn\'t see a major change on what we\'ve had this year. Mark Irvine-Fortescue - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Mark Irvine-Fortescue from Jefferies. Just one, please. Has the easier fuel environment been a significant driver of your decision to ground fewer planes this winter? Or would you have been as aggressive if the oil price stayed where it was? Michael O\'Leary I think I wouldn\'t have made any difference. I mean, what\'s driving the aggression or the aggressive expansion this winter has been the successful growth during the summer and the exceptional demand for the Ryanair services all across Europe and I think the continuing cutbacks in short-haul capacity by Air Berlin in Germany, Alitalia in Italy, Iberia in Spain, TAP in Portugal. I mean, we\'re not expanding -- the expansion has nothing to do with fuel. I suspect if fuel prices were rising, it might be somewhat more difficult, but there would then probably be more short-haul capacity being taken out by other competitors. So really, as Neil has explained earlier, what we tried to do with the fuel hedging strategy is just lock away cost certainty on a 12-month basis, and then run the business commercially, as David has explained, tried take advantage of opportunities where they arise. And certainly, there\'s an enormous opportunity now at the primary airports around Europe, who are very concerned that easyJet, BA and others are not going to grow or are going to -- will not meet their previously agreed growth objectives, and they need somebody else in there who will. Neil Sorahan Yes. We come into this year as 90% hedged. So our decisions were well made before the current dip in oil prices. James Hollins - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division It\'s James Hollins from Nomura. Just on your increased traffic guidance. I was wondering if you could split sort of how much was high capacity, and then how much is high loads. Should I be thinking about load factor up 4 percentage points as you were in H1 for the full year? And sort of adjunct to that, do you think you can grow that load factor in full year \'15? And the second one is I know you\'re always good for views. I was wondering, Michael, if you can give your view on those compensation changes that are coming through or seems to be coming through from this court case we\'ve had recently and how you plan to deal with that if you [indiscernible]. Michael O\'Leary Yes. A significant proportion of the traffic growth this winter will come from load factor growth. We expect load factors to remain about 4% higher than they were at this time last year, but that\'s obviously on the back of very significant capacity growth this winter. Overall, for the year, we expect load factors will rise from 83% in FY \'14 to about 87% in FY \'15. We then expect to take up load factors next year into FY \'16 by maybe another 1 or 2 percentage points. I mean, the objective is over the next 2 years, FY \'16 and \'17, to get average load factors up from 87% to about 90%, which will mean a lot of full flights almost on a year-round basis. But to be fair, so easyJet has demonstrated that they can do it with smaller aircraft, so we see no reason that we can\'t achieve those load factors with bigger aircraft but with much lower fares. And certainly, one of the reasons why our unit costs has been so good at the moment is taking up those load factors and has a significant impact on unit costs. In EU261, I mean, the latest kind of decisions are more of the same trend, where you\'re getting really some crazy court rulings that now makes the airlines responsible for tech. Apparently now, we\'re supposed to know when aircraft will go wrong, which, of course, if we knew they were going to wrong, we\'d fix them, they wouldn\'t go wrong. But I think it\'s really around the edges. It\'s another area of competitive advantage for Ryanair. We have better punctuality than every other airline in Europe. We have a higher rate of technical reliability, we have fewer cancellations and fewer delays. So whereas there, those could be some costs, it would be far less for Ryanair than for any of our other competitors. A question over here? Damian Brewer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Damian Brewer from RBC. Two questions, please. First of all, can you give us an update on where you are on sort of technology and Web-enabled selling in terms of what you were developing? And then secondly, whether there\'s anything that, that can translate into sort of further efficiencies on the cost base or just being able to leverage the business more, so not just on the revenue side but on the cost side as well. And then can you give us an update on where you are in Aer Lingus? Obviously, competing much harder against it with the frequencies, where does that leave you in terms of what you do with the stake in the business? Michael O\'Leary Okay. The Ryanair Labs development is moving along at some pace. We\'re seeing now almost biweekly updates or updated and improved versions of both the desktop, the website and the mobile app. Over the next 6 to 12 months, you\'ll see a number of other developments. We\'re looking at making the ryanair.com website not just the kind of the capital website -- not just a website for low prices but making it a much more one-stop travel opportunity. At the moment, we spend a lot of time improving the way we retail things, like airport transfers, the car hires. There\'s a new hotel partner coming online very shortly. But we\'re now looking at different developments over the next 12 months, where you\'ll see us put up, for example, the one I\'m particularly keen on is comparison pricing. So every time you\'re on our website on any of our routes, we\'ll put up the competitor prices, our low-fare competitor prices. Because we are spilling a lot of people going off into these price aggregators or the Skyscanners and the eDreams, looking at who\'s got the lowest fares. Well, come to our website straightaway, and we\'ll give you the same price comparisons, they\'ll sit down at the right-hand side while you\'re booking on. And as you change a data or a flight or a destination, the price comparison technology will change on the right-hand side. So we want to pull you on to our website, where you know you\'ve got the lowest fares. We\'ll confirm it every time by putting up all of the lower fares of our competitor airlines on that route, on that date, on that flight, and then expanding into other developments, like putting up TripAdvisor feature on the website, customer feedback, rate the flight, rate the destination, rate your hotel, rate the experience. So that we are -- more and more people, we know they have to come to Ryanair for the fare -- for the flight and the fare, so why don\'t we keep them on our website for all the other kind of services that are, heretofore, they would have gone to a different website for? So whether it\'s customer reviews, ratings, recommendations or price comparisons, keep them on our website. There\'s a whole series of innovations that Ryanair Labs, which we\'ve only just set up and the CTO is only there less than 4 weeks, are working on. And you\'ll see those rolled out over the next 12 months. I think what they will do is there\'ll be significant efficiencies in terms of we\'ll have to spend less money on marketing. As we\'ve done, there\'s been a big jump in marketing spend this year to kind of support the Always Getting Better program. So we\'ll have more people now registered with Ryanair, customizing their travel for them, sending them individually tailored offers. We\'ll know with big data, we\'ll know more about the profile of each individual customer. So I think there\'ll be a big significant savings for us in sales and marketing. There should be some upward spike in ancillary revenues. But other than that, there won\'t be any other significant efficiencies. On Aer Lingus, the U.K. appeal will be heard before the end of calendar [Technical Difficulty] Operator [Operator Instructions] Michael O\'Leary Months, maybe 18 or 24 months. In the meantime though, however, the Aer Lingus thing has kind of -- well, we\'ve gone beyond it now, like we originally wanted Aer Lingus because it was going to be the vehicle by which we would go into the primary airports and kind of outdo easyJet at the primarily airports. We\'re now going to do that as Ryanair. We won the price -- the kind of price war. Now we\'re using Ryanair to be the softer -- to soften the somewhat harsh image of Ryanair, go into the primary airports, and we will now do what we wanted to do in Aer Lingus, we\'ll now do it as Ryanair. Having said that, we\'ll continue to make those appeals. We still think -- I mean, we\'re still stuck in this area where we had the bizarre situation that the European Union has blocked the current offer on the basis that competition intensified between Ryanair and Aer Lingus over the previous 3 years. The Brits have then come along and said, "You have to settle [ph] down because competition lessened over the 3 years." But if the Brits are right, then the Europeans can\'t blocked us buying it. And if the Europeans are right, then the Brits can\'t get involved anyway. So it\'s a tiresome irritant but increasingly, it\'s become about as increasingly irrelevant. We\'ve now -- I think around on the back of the government\'s decision now to scrap the travel tax, we\'re expanding rapidly in Ireland. We\'re taking enormous amounts of market share away from Aer Lingus. Customers, as we flesh out the schedules on from Ireland to the U.K., be in Europe this winter, are increasingly switching to Ryanair for their travel needs. And I think Aer Lingus will continue to shrivel and really not go anywhere in a hurry. It just becomes one of that group of peripheral European airlines that don\'t have any significant future but will continue to exist as peripheral subscale carriers in Europe. Alexia? Alexia Dogani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division It\'s Alexia Dogani from Goldman Sachs. I have 3 questions as well. Just firstly on FY \'16 and sort of unit cost of fuel drivers, clearly this year, given the increase in capacity growth, you\'re going to have a flat unit cost of fuel position. Should we expect similar situation next year? And what are the moving parts? Then secondly, on your comments about the load factor, I mean, clearly you have delivered earlier than expected some of the improvements. Do you think there is scope to go beyond 90%? Or would you then say we prefer to take more of the market through price rather than volume? And then just finally, in the context of the lower oil fuel price now, I mean, do you see a bit of the economics of the 737 MAX change sort of unfavorably in the sense of the fuel savings slightly reduced? Any comments around that would be helpful. Michael O\'Leary Thanks, Alexia. So okay, on FY \'16, we\'re staying away from FY \'16. We\'re too early in the cycle to be getting into -- we haven\'t even done the budget for FY \'16 yet. However, absent anything that we haven\'t yet seen, such as some crazy EUROCONTROL price increase, we think it\'s reasonable to expect that x fuel unit costs will be reasonably flat as long as the sector length remains reasonably unchanged out into FY \'16. And any further than that, I wouldn\'t go. Load factor, as we build the load factor, I think over the next 2 years, up from 87% to 90%, there\'s no reason why we would stop at 90%. But I think the gains would be harder at that point in time. Because you\'re really now -- at 90%, you\'re full essentially on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays, and you\'re trying to get up from 75% to 76% to 77% in Tuesdays and Wednesdays. But I think we would, certainly on the basis of our experience this year, err in favor of raising load factors rather than trying to raise yields. We continue to believe that the -- as we double in size in the next 10 years, the real upside for Ryanair is capitalizing on what is a huge price advantage over every other airline in the same way that Lidl and Aldi are doing such damage to Tescos and Sainsbury\'s and everybody else here. We wouldn\'t want to give that away. And there\'s a lot of unit cost advantages to bringing up the load factors. So on balance, we won\'t stop at 90%, but it would be harder to cross those kind of load factor gains. Lower oil prices, yes, it may around the edges have lessened the effect. But I think there\'s no doubt when fuel is our biggest cost and we have an aircraft here that has 4% more revenue opportunity, 4% more seats and an 18% lower per seat fuel savings, almost regardless of what the fuel price is, it\'s a huge unit cost advantage for us in 5 years\' time that nobody else will have. And I think again it just begins -- you build, began to establish not just a huge price leadership over every other airlines but a widening unit cost gap between us and other airlines. I don\'t worry too much about the short-term fluctuations in fuel. I mean, one of the downsides, for example, of the declining spot price in fuel is some of the flakier, loss-making competitors, like Norwegian and Wales and those guys, who are on hedge because they don\'t have a balance sheet to be able to hedge, will probably do a little bit better in the short term. Frankly, I don\'t think it makes any difference. We have the cost discipline. We certainly have enormous momentum in the business model. And I think that one of the great things about having these Damascene conversions is there\'s an enormous appetite out there across Europe for the Ryanair Damascene conversion. So the more I talk about having this enlightening moment last year in changing and realizing that everything I\'ve done all my life was all wrong and yada, yada, yada, you get enormous acreage of free publicity about the Ryanair change and Ryanair is now being nice to the customers, yada, yada, yada. That on BBC this morning, all they want to talk about is some stupid survey at the weekend of 18,000 who says Ryanair is the second-worst brand in the world and [indiscernible]. Long may we continue to be so while the traffic grows by 9% and the profits jump 45%. So in some cases, pandering to whatever it is the impression out there works. But having said that, we are committed to improving the current customer experience and we\'re not there yet. We still have another year, 2 years of improvements to go. Neil Glynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Neil from Crédit Suisse. Just one question on how you deploy your fleet through the winter. You\'ve obviously made the decision, I think you\'re grounding on these 50 this winter? Michael O\'Leary Yes. Neil Glynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division It\'s not that long ago where you operated a full fleet or thereabouts in the winter, I think maybe 4 years ago. And as you progress, as you make the business less seasonal, do you think could we ever get back to you operating in nearly full fleet in the winter? David O\'Brien Such as there\'s inevitably -- the question is there are different amounts in the summer to the winter. And as we grow frequencies to even higher levels, the trick would be to have frequencies in the winter. And into the shoulders, it\'s sufficiently high level to be able to drop some of them to cater for the summer growth. That\'s the conundrum that would take a number of years to address because you need to have capacity that is exclusively directed towards summer products and flying on ski routes every Saturday is not a balancing thing. So as we increase frequencies on primarily routes, that creates then the capacity for the summer and balances it, if that makes sense. Michael O\'Leary Can we just take some phone questions now if you don\'t mind, please? Just run them through. Operator We have 5 questions on the phone so far. The first is from Donal O\'Neill of Redburn. Donal O\'Neill - Redburn Partners LLP, Research Division It\'s Donal O\'Neill from Redburn. A couple of questions, please, guys. First one, just in terms of the growth you\'re expecting in the second half of the year. You\'ve kind of touched a little bit on market share. But what proportion of the growth is 16% in the second half do you think will come from market share gains versus from sort of underlying demand or prices-stimulated demand, given what you\'re trying to do on fares? The second question for the change in guidance for second half cost from plus 4% to flat are actually unit costs. Is all of that down to load factor? Or is there a portion of that, that has a change in the underlying cost base? And what that might be? And lastly, on kind of a more of forward-looking question, the net cash balance is pretty strong in the first half and obviously is going to be positive again in the second half. And if we were to take a sort of a flat assumption for FY \'16 versus FY \'15, it\'s going to be even greater in net cash the year after. Have you thought about what you might do with the balance sheet for FY \'16? Michael O\'Leary Okay. Thanks, Donal. I\'ll take the first of that. Neil will do the guidance and units costs, then I\'ll do 1 and 3. On the second half growth, I mean, in essence, nearly all of it will come from market share gains. While some of these are new markets for us, as we go into Glasgow-London, Edinburgh-London here, it\'s inevitable that we will take significant market share off easyJet and British Airways, partly because we have much lower fares but also because we have better times and a much better punctuality. Same thing, for example, in the market in Portugal, we\'re going double daily from Porto to Lisbon. Italy, we\'re taking -- but in Italy, we\'re not just taking market share, Alitalia is ceding the market share, too, as is Air Berlin in Germany. So while all of this will be new growth for us, most will come at the expense of market share gains. And I think we\'ll take significant -- we\'re already taking significant market share off Aer Lingus on the Dublin-U.K. [indiscernible] routes. But also this winter, we\'re going double dailies from Dublin, for example, to the main European capitals of Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, Milan, whereas Aer Lingus only do single dailies. I think we will take all of that significant market share off them, particularly for business passengers who want to go out and back on the same day. In terms of the net cash balances, yes, they\'re writing strongly. But remember, we\'re entering into a period of significant CapEx growth here for the next 2 or 3 years, where we\'re ramping up a lot of aircraft orders. We will probably pay more. I mean, we\'ll probably spend more of our own cash on those aircraft deliveries going forward than we did in the past. But if trading continues as it to be -- if we continue in line with guidance, the cash generation will continue to be strong. And as we have previously said in the past, we will revisit it on an annual basis. I think the special dividend will be paid in February. As long as we have some confidence into FY \'16 that we\'ll look then at another -- a share buyback program. Because I think on balance, we should be doing every second year, a special dividend and share buyback. So certainly, the board has already disclosed the possibility of another share buyback into calendar 2015 once we\'ve paid out the special dividends. So I think, yes, we will continue to look at rewarding the shareholders -- we returned EUR 2.5 billion to shareholders in the last 6 years through special dividends and share buybacks. And we expect to continue that program. Neil, do you want to comment on the... Neil Sorahan Yes. On the H2 cost guidance, we\'ve added an extra 2 million passengers into the mix. We\'ve gone from 87 million to 89 million passengers for the full year. And this is the primary reason why we\'ve been able to drop the unit cost savings down from plus 4% to flat. With fuel included, we\'re expecting 9% unit cost reductions on fuel this year. So when fuel is taken into the mix, we have a 4% unit cost reduction on total cost. Operator Our next question comes from Robin Byde of Cantor Fitzgerald. Robin Byde - Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, Research Division Just 2 for me, please. Firstly, just on refinancing. Obviously, you\'ve very successfully just issued your first bond. So do you have any further refi needs in the next 12 months? And then just secondly on CapEx, just as sort of follow-on to the earlier question, can you just update us on your expected gross outflows in FY \'16 and \'17? Is that still about EUR 1 billion each year? And do you expect to see any significant inflows from disposals? Neil Sorahan Okay. Robin, just on the CapEx first, we haven\'t changed our guidance on that. It\'s still EUR 1 billion a year for the next 2 years. The predelivery payments on the MAX deal don\'t really kick in after about \'17 onwards. On refinancing, we had a very successful bond issuance earlier on this year. We\'re at BBB+ rating, the most highly rated airline in the world. It\'s something that we will be looking at again. We have a EUR 3 billion EMTN program in place. We\'ve drawn down EUR 850 million of that and we can refresh it at anytime we want. We will continue to pay PDPs out of cash. And some of our CapEx next year will be debt-financed then. At the moment, the unsecured eurobond market looks attractive. Michael O\'Leary It\'s likely that we\'ll raise another eurobond -- I mean, another issuance some time before the end of FY \'16. Operator Our next question comes from Mark Simpson of Goodbody. Mark A. Simpson - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Just 2 questions. One, just wanted to touch on the business traffic again. You\'re talking about mid-single digit in terms of penetration in the winter months. That kind of suggests that you\'re looking at over 9,000 travelers a day on that Business Plus. Just wondering if you can give us a kind of number or numbers in terms of steady sales. And then the second side is you\'ve mentioned in a sense some of the response by competitors, where you are being more aggressive. I wonder if you could tell us a bit more about whether you see airlines retreating or whether you see them trying to match your prices. But given the widening cost gap, obviously that\'s going to be a significant cost not sustainable from those competitors. So I\'m wondering if you could just give us a bit more picture about how you see them responding to your current program. Michael O\'Leary Thanks, Mark. The figures you quote on the business traffic, there are days when we are selling those kind of numbers. But I really don\'t want to get any -- or lock us into any kind of number or forecast on the uptake of Business Plus. It\'s a product that I think would be a slow build, particularly in primary airports, where at the moment, many of the primary airports haven\'t even flown with Ryanair before. I think what gives us confidence is that we have 25% of passengers traveling with us on business. The question is how many of those will convert? And I think 10% over a 2- or 3-year period is a reasonably ambitious objective. It\'s too early to say yet. I think what will be instructive is how it builds this winter, particularly on those routes where we do have business schedules, like double dailies out of Dublin to Europe, the 4 and 5 times dailies out of Dublin to the U.K. [indiscernible] and the Scotland-London route. Response by competitors, I mean, it\'s kind of hard for us at moment to notice much of the response by competitors. In general terms, we tend not to see much of a pricing response because most of them are pricing so much higher than we are and they\'re under cost pressure themselves either from their airports, the airports they\'re at or their unions. I think actually most of what we know at the moment is the extent to which there are significant capacity reductions coming through in Germany, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal. And I think really we see more and more people taking out short-haul capacity as being the response. But it\'s a response more to their own kind of economic difficulties than necessarily response to our expansions. But we see very little aggressive pricing response from any of the airlines, whether it\'s Aer Lingus in Ireland, easyJet in the U.K., TAP in Portugal, Alitalia in Italy, because frankly none of them can compete with us on pricing anyway. David, do you want to add anything to that in terms of competitor response? David O\'Brien No, that\'s a reasonable summary. Operator Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Just 2 very quick questions. One is would you be doing less subleasing over the summer now that you have your fleet going back or expect a similar amount? And then the second question is just on the primary airport costs, given your new plans, is there additional pressure there from a cost perspective? Michael O\'Leary We leased in this summer 7 aircraft just to kind of keep -- so that we have that kind of capacity during the summer because we\'re taking delivery of 15 aircraft in the remainder of the fiscal -- in the winter part of fiscal year. We want to have some of those routes up and running. Having parted out the summer \'16 schedule already, and we again released it 3 months earlier than we did last year so that we can maintain this positive momentum in forward bookings, already we thought it looks like we need to new lease in another 6 or 7 aircraft next summer. That\'s because we only take delivery of 20 aircraft from Boeing between now and the end of May -- the end of June next year. The following winter, winter \'15 and \'16, we take delivery of almost 40 aircraft. So for summer \'16, we won\'t need any lease-in aircraft. So I think what you\'ll see is as we lease in 7 in summer \'14, we\'ve got to need another 6 or 7 in summer \'15, and then nothing in summer \'16 because we have enough aircraft delivery to be able to handle it all ourselves. I think on primary airports, we have a mix there because undoubtedly, the primary airports tend to be more expensive than the average of our secondary airports. But as you can see in the cost analysis and the unit cost discipline, the key feature for us at the primary airports is one that we can secure 25-minute turnarounds and therefore, maintain our efficiency. There\'s no doubt that the cost or the opportunities at the primary airports are getting better as more and more primary airports compete with us to get our scarce capacity into summer \'15 and summer \'16. So we\'re getting real and material discounts at the primary airports. And to that, you have to balance the fact that we have a 10-year growth agreement at London Stansted, where we have very low-cost base for growth. You have a growth deal at Dublin Airport, allied to the Irish government scrapping the travel tax, which has been good for our cost out of Dublin. So we\'re able to mix-and-match some of the primary airport development with also declining cost in some of our existing primary airports as well as in some cases, [indiscernible] the very low-cost secondary airports. So if you look at the numbers for the quarter, yes, the cost of the airport -- the handling costs have risen at a slightly higher rate than passenger traffic volumes but nothing that we can\'t handle within an overall flat unit cost for the full year. Operator And the final question on the phone so far is from Anand Date of Deutsche Bank. Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Michael, I\'m just wondering if I could have your latest thoughts on maybe Ryanair holidays or the way your latest thinking is on maybe a frequent flyer program. That seems the one thing that is maybe missing that you\'ve been reluctant to do in the past. And also just out of curiosity, could you maybe go through some of the basic dynamics of a difference between domestic routes and international routes? So just what you kind of see versus each other in terms of loads, business versus the FI [ph] yields and whether given you\'re becoming fairly dominant on some markets for domestic, whether you\'ll return to potentially offering tie-ups with the legacy carriers there. Michael O\'Leary Yes. Thanks, Anand. The first 2 of those are very much part of the Ryanair Labs strategic and development program. I think we already carry a huge number of holidaymakers across Europe. I think it\'s inevitable that we will -- but it\'s over a medium-term rollout kind of holiday product, where you\'d be able to get all-inclusive holiday packages on the Ryanair website. But it\'s not high up on the agenda. It won\'t be in the next 12 months. It might be something over the next 2 or 3 years. Frequent flyer program, we won\'t have a frequent flyer program in the sense of the traditional frequent flyer program with plastic cards and accounts and points and all the rest of it. But for the passengers who register with us on the My Ryanair registration, we\'ll have -- big data will enable us to have a much more individualized or tailored frequent flyer program. So what I see us doing maybe as early as the end of calendar \'15 is those passengers, we\'ll be writing to passengers, thanking them for flying with us in 2015. Those who flew maybe 4 times than last year will get an incentive to fly more than 6 times in 2016. Those who flew 20 times within 2014 will get a thank you of a 50% off a flight in January and February 2015. So we\'ll have individual, tailored, I think, offers recognizing the volumes for each individual passenger and trying to incentivize each individual passenger rather than a big cumbersome FFD program that takes a lot of administration and everything else. We were able to do the analysis. The data mining we\'re doing now will enable us to have an individually designed kind of encourage more flying program with each individual passenger. David, do you want to comment on the domestic and international routes? David O\'Brien Sure. I mean, the key -- one of the key features of the domestic route is that it tends to be shorter and demand higher frequencies, which is useful in delivering on volume to airports, while at the same time, allowing you to have a highly efficient schedule by attaching a short domestic, let\'s say, first thing in the morning, to a longer international flight, solving the airport passenger volume problem and adding new routes. The negative with domestics is that they tend to be later bookings, so you don\'t see the future as early and they tend to attract lesser ancillaries. So on balance, they are a very positive development in terms of fleet utilization, traffic volumes and so on and sector length. Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division So Michael, is it possible could I ask a follow-up? Michael O\'Leary Yes. Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just in terms of the big data, is there any other way you can monetize it as well? Because I\'m just kind of thinking if I look at Smiles, if I look at Multiplus, you\'ve probably got one of the few data sources that is growing and probably getting a deeper amount of data per passenger. Is there anything else you can do with the data as well in terms of third parties or anything like that? Michael O\'Leary I think there\'s lots of things we can do, but I think we need to be careful. Like we\'re not in the old days, we\'d simply run around and sold the data. I think what we want to do is to bring more and more people on to the ryanair.com website, more and more people to register. And I think there\'s a number of different things we\'re looking at under the Ryanair Labs banner, where we can exploit the data and use or monetize probably by attracting other partners to come and work with the ryanair.com website to provide other value to our passengers. We\'ll be able to give them very rich content, very detailed profiles off of an enormous passenger base. But that\'s really not for today. I\'m conscious of the fact that if we want to give kind of the whole Ryanair Labs development, I think it\'s something that we\'ll be doing -- detailing in much more detail when we get to the full year results roadshow next May. Are there any more questions in the room? Nothing more on the phone? So thanks, everybody, then for joining in today. I\'ll say we have extensive roadshows, there\'s 8 teams on the road covering all of the markets. If you haven\'t or you want a meeting with us through the week, please let us know either through Davy or at Citibank or through our own Investor Relations team and we\'ll pencil you in. Other than that, I look forward to meeting everybody hopefully on a one-to-one basis during the weekend. Thank you very much for dialing in and coming this morning. As I said, the business is progressing very well. Certainly, the more aggressive forward bookings and pricing is certainly finding favor among the customer base.The changes we\'ve made in the customer experience and the improvements, which I think is year 1 of a 3-year program, is certainly being welcomed by our passengers. I think we have a lock on, but there\'s still much more to be done over the next 2 or 3 years. And can I please again caution the analysts, don\'t be inventing numbers here. The figure won\'t be north of EUR 800 million for the current year. We\'ve done very well. We expect profits to grow by about 45%, but that will be enough for this year, I hope. And we\'re beginning to focus in on next year and how we roll out further improvements, and hopefully further profitability and share price gains. Thanks very much, everybody.

Thank you!', 'qAndAText': 'Jarrod Castle - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division Michael, it\'s Jarrod Castle from UBS. Can you just give a bit of color in terms of the business products that came in relatively, I guess, late during the quarter? Can you talk a little bit about the takeup? I think maybe Howard has mentioned in the past, it could be 5% to 10% takeup there. And then also maybe just a bit of color in terms of what the takeup was on the Family product, which obviously came in a lot earlier for the summer period. Then just on fuel, obviously the per metric ton is down 2% year-over-year, given your hedging. But there will be some obviously efficiency with the new planes. So can you maybe give a bit of color in terms of how you see the total fuel goal for 2016? And then lastly, just on acquisitions, there was obviously a lot of talk about Cyprus. Anything happening on that front? Michael O\'Leary Thanks, Jarrod. I\'ll just take those. As the base -- I mean, the Family products took off like a rocket during the summer, primarily because there\'s lots of families traveling during the summer. We were discounting allocated seating, discounting the bag fee for families, children traveling as part of family groups. That was very successful. In percentage terms, it\'s not enormous. But I think it\'s part of the new Ryanair of communicating that we care about your family. We recognize that some of the additional fees are prohibitive if it\'s a family group of 3 or 4. And it certainly has been very well received by families traveling with us during the summer period. The business product was more a -- we expected we did kind of a quiet launch through the summer. The takeup -- remember, we\'ve got 25% of passengers traveling on business -- already traveling on business. The objective over a 3- to 5-year period is to see if we can convert about half of that 25%, so 10% or 12%, to paying us a premium for a package of services. The build at the moment in the summer is slow. It\'s low single digits. We would expect it to grow during the winter period. And again, it\'s one of the reasons, as David mentioned, why we\'ve specifically gone into certain markets, like the Glasgow there, London, Edinburgh-London. But also why we\'re fleshing out schedules, particularly from Dublin to the U.K. piece in London and from Stansted to European cities. So we\'d hoped to see it build to mid-single digits over the winter period. But I think it\'s a product that will build slowly as people -- more and more people become aware of it. Cyprus, we\'re into the second round of offers. The [indiscernible] process is a little bit chaotic down there partly because the Cypriot government are trying to deal with this state aid investigation by the European Union, which we believe is likely to rule Cyprus Airways did receive illegal state aid and therefore, must repay us. I again take the view we\'re unlikely to be the winners. I suspect it\'s also Aegean because Cypriot\'s camp has been told to pass it on to the Greeks. If it does go to Aegean, we would simply proceed with our application for a Cypriot AOC and we\'ll establish a Ryanair Cyprus operation, which would exploit some of the opportunities that undoubtedly exist and to rebuild traffic between the island of the Cyprus and a lot of those Middle Eastern destinations. And Neil, will you take the fuel question? Neil Sorahan Yes, sure. Jarrod, in relation to fuel, as you said yourself, we\'ve got less than 2% unit cost reductions into next year. We\'ve hedged to $930 per metric ton. We\'ve got the euro-dollar locked in at about 1.33. That\'s going to deliver 2% unit cost reduction. In relation to the new aircraft that are coming in, we started taking delivery of the 180 NG order. Those aircraft won\'t be hugely more efficient than aircraft that we already have. We\'ve updated most of our engines under the existing fleet with the tech insertions to get the maximum benefit from those engines. There will be a moderate fuel burn improvement. But the real change will come in 2019, when we start to take the MAX, which has got 18% unit -- 18% fuel burn efficiency over the NG. Oliver Sleath - Barclays Capital, Research Division It\'s Oliver Sleath from Barclays. Three questions, please. Firstly, on the ancillaries, can you talk your latest review on that? I think we were assuming flat at the moment. I\'m interested to know if things like the Business Plus, does any of that get accounted in ancillaries or not if I just roll in the base? Secondly, on the primary airports, obviously you have some of the primaries, like Rome, going for a little while now. So I guess, a question for David is, I mean, are you actually seeing a higher average fare in the primary airports now versus your sort of underlying secondary airport mix? Or is it just more in the load factor still? And then thirdly, how much of the growth this winter is actually going to be pure frequency versus new routes? David O\'Brien Putting them in reverse order, I would say about 50%, maybe 60% is increased frequency through the course of this winter, certainly the existing routes, such as Dublin and Stansted, the remainder is new, and new high frequency, if you take Glasgow and Edinburgh into London. In terms of the primary airports, we\'re encouraged by what we see. Every -- the load factors have been excellent and the start of the yields are growing in the direction we would like them to grow. There is competition, but the evidence seems to be that the competition are losing enthusiasm. And if you take Brussels, you don\'t hear Vueling say anything about Brussels anymore. One could expect to retreat there, I imagine. Michael O\'Leary And on the third part, ancillaries, we would expect the ancillaries be flat over the year, whoever\'s next has got to keep it moving. Ancillaries, we expect to be generally flat over the next year. As you can see, the allocated seating is making up for a lot of the fee reductions, the airport and baggage fee reductions, which is a good performance. And we would expect that to continue. To the extent that Business Plus, as there\'s a pickup in Business Plus, some of the ancillary revenue will move above the line into yields because we\'ll be including some of those services, such as the reserve seating, the free bag, would actually go up into yields. So I think the objective, if we can continue to keep ancillaries growing at the same rate as headline traffic growth, I think we would be pleased with that performance. Stephen Furlong? Stephen Furlong - Davy, Research Division Yes. Stephen Furlong from Davy. Just a couple of quick ones. In terms of the forward bookings, Michael, does that help in giving you greater visibility in terms of where you could see yields going. Presumably even with those forward bookings, it gives you some idea of Q3, but it\'s still well too early to know where Q4 is going to be. Just my comment on that. And for Dave, I was wondering, in terms of the frequencies that you\'ve added since the last quarter, has it been in some of these domestic routes, where you\'re seeing you\'re booked up very well? Or you\'ve obviously added somewhere. Maybe give an example where you\'ve just bumped up the frequencies, that will be good. And then you might just talk just quickly, I noticed you announced a base in Copenhagen. You\'ve looked at that before. Maybe just what your views about what\'s going on in Scandinavian markets. And is there a lot of interest there from airports, please? Michael O\'Leary Yes. I think I\'ve been nervous on the forward bookings. The forward bookings are very strong. But ultimately, the final yield is determined by the close-in bookings. All I can say at this point in time, that for the last number of months and again in September and again in October, we have been pleasantly surprised by the strength of the close-in bookings and the strength of the yields at close-in bookings even as we are taking out lower fares because the load factors are rising. There seems to be no resistance to people closer in paying the higher fares. Now I ascribe some of that to the fact that actually the competition is just pushing or trying to push up fares even higher. And so in essence, they\'re sending traffic in our direction. There\'s no doubt we\'ve been helped by almost continuous cycle of industrial relations problems among other airlines, strikes in Aer Lingus, TAP pilot strike for 4 days, Lufthansa, Air France, et cetera. But there does seem to be an underlying momentum in the business at the moment that I thought would dip as we went into the winter. And thus far, although still little bit early, it doesn\'t seem to be dipping. I don\'t think that gives me great confidence on our visibility into the final yields for Q3 or Q4. As you can see in our guidance, we still expect the yields to dip. We continue to be pleasantly surprised. I think the real objective though is that through this winter is to push out lost capacity, grab a lot of market share, even if we do so by cutting prices during the winter. We will emerge into the H1 of 2016 or next year\'s summer peak with so much forward momentum in such a good shape in a lot of these market bases, particularly as the word gets out that Ryanair is changing, it\'s not steep enough anymore, it\'s cheap and very good and the experience is excellent. I think that will have a lot of positive momentum built in itself. So stronger forward bookings doesn\'t give us a lot of yield visibility, which is why the guidance has changed. So relatively rapidly in a relatively short period of time at the AGM at the end of September, we were still saying upper end of the [indiscernible] EUR 650 million and why today, we\'re able to go, say, EUR 760 million with a reasonable degree of confidence. But I don\'t think it\'s going to go much above that. There will be some analysts out there going, "Oh, let\'s stick an EUR 800 million number on it." It won\'t -- I don\'t think it\'ll be EUR 800 million because I still expect, given the capacity additions we\'re going to be making this winter, that it will come in still somewhere below EUR 800 million. I think the guidance we\'re giving now with reasonable visibility in Q3 should be fairly accurate. But I hope I continue to be positively surprised. David, do you want to touch on the frequency additions in Copenhagen? David O\'Brien Sure. So we launched a lot of our domestic routes this summer, if we take routes in Poland and in Portugal. In fact, we were aware at the time that we didn\'t have enough frequencies. So what we\'re doing now is adding sufficient frequency to give a decent schedule. If you take Gdansk and Brussels up to Warsaw, we were running 1 a day, we\'re now running 2 a day. And ultimately, we can see that go to 3 or 4. Clearly 1 a day isn\'t an adequate schedule, so we\'re down to 2. Similarly, with Lisbon in Portugal, it was 1 a day [indiscernible] and it will inevitably grow into perhaps winter \'15. Stansted-Glasgow, Stansted-Edinburgh, that\'s from 0 up to 3. And that\'s on foot of exceptional enthusiasm by both Glasgow Airport and Edinburgh Airport for growth, which they\'re not seeing the way they expected before from other carriers. So it\'s part of the growth deal there and it\'s an excellent utilization for our aircraft, also supports our business product and feeds into a very substantial route network at Stansted. Informally, it could be a lot of -- more self-connected [indiscernible]. And finally, in Italy, as in Alitalia, they\'re 1 reduced, we\'re simply adding there, taking the opportunity to take Rome Fiumicino to Catania or to Palermo. That represents us filling a gap being vacated by Air One and Alitalia. With respect to Scandinavia, I think our announcement in Copenhagen has created a lot of reaction within the other Scandinavian cities, which recognize that their overreliance on -- if you take Norwegian\'s own results, they\'ve described themselves as make or break and described -- in their own presentation, described SAS as need government bailout. When you consider that 80% of Orlando [ph] is either needs government bailouts or is make or break, you can understand there. And we are the only people now that can help them out. So those conversations are ongoing. They\'re ongoing for winter \'15, which gives us quite an amount of time to pick and choose. Meanwhile, we have the other parts of the network, take the Eastern Mediterranean, with its own demand for our deliveries. Michael O\'Leary I think Jack is next. Jack Diskin - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Just 2 questions for me this morning. Firstly, in relation to the percentage growth in average fare during Q2, how much do you attribute that to improvement in underlying trading versus, I guess, FX movements during the period? And secondly, just on sector length, with the increased focus on domestic line, how do you see this evolving into H2 \'15 and possibly in FY \'16 in terms of a percentage reduction year-on-year? Neil Sorahan Well, in relation to the average fare, approximately 1% of that will be related to FX, primarily on sterling. Now with a natural hedge in relation to sterling, where we offset our cost against our revenues, you could -- will contribute about 1%, 1.5% to Easter [ph] and the rest is on underlying trading within business. Jack Diskin - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division And tax events? Neil Sorahan Tax events for the full year will be broadly flat. It was up -- sorry, it was down 1% in the first half and we\'re expecting this to be broadly flat for the full year. Jack Diskin - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Into next year? Neil Sorahan Into next year, we haven\'t done the budget yet for next year. But based on the schedule, I think I wouldn\'t see a major change on what we\'ve had this year. Mark Irvine-Fortescue - Jefferies LLC, Research Division Mark Irvine-Fortescue from Jefferies. Just one, please. Has the easier fuel environment been a significant driver of your decision to ground fewer planes this winter? Or would you have been as aggressive if the oil price stayed where it was? Michael O\'Leary I think I wouldn\'t have made any difference. I mean, what\'s driving the aggression or the aggressive expansion this winter has been the successful growth during the summer and the exceptional demand for the Ryanair services all across Europe and I think the continuing cutbacks in short-haul capacity by Air Berlin in Germany, Alitalia in Italy, Iberia in Spain, TAP in Portugal. I mean, we\'re not expanding -- the expansion has nothing to do with fuel. I suspect if fuel prices were rising, it might be somewhat more difficult, but there would then probably be more short-haul capacity being taken out by other competitors. So really, as Neil has explained earlier, what we tried to do with the fuel hedging strategy is just lock away cost certainty on a 12-month basis, and then run the business commercially, as David has explained, tried take advantage of opportunities where they arise. And certainly, there\'s an enormous opportunity now at the primary airports around Europe, who are very concerned that easyJet, BA and others are not going to grow or are going to -- will not meet their previously agreed growth objectives, and they need somebody else in there who will. Neil Sorahan Yes. We come into this year as 90% hedged. So our decisions were well made before the current dip in oil prices. James Hollins - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division It\'s James Hollins from Nomura. Just on your increased traffic guidance. I was wondering if you could split sort of how much was high capacity, and then how much is high loads. Should I be thinking about load factor up 4 percentage points as you were in H1 for the full year? And sort of adjunct to that, do you think you can grow that load factor in full year \'15? And the second one is I know you\'re always good for views. I was wondering, Michael, if you can give your view on those compensation changes that are coming through or seems to be coming through from this court case we\'ve had recently and how you plan to deal with that if you [indiscernible]. Michael O\'Leary Yes. A significant proportion of the traffic growth this winter will come from load factor growth. We expect load factors to remain about 4% higher than they were at this time last year, but that\'s obviously on the back of very significant capacity growth this winter. Overall, for the year, we expect load factors will rise from 83% in FY \'14 to about 87% in FY \'15. We then expect to take up load factors next year into FY \'16 by maybe another 1 or 2 percentage points. I mean, the objective is over the next 2 years, FY \'16 and \'17, to get average load factors up from 87% to about 90%, which will mean a lot of full flights almost on a year-round basis. But to be fair, so easyJet has demonstrated that they can do it with smaller aircraft, so we see no reason that we can\'t achieve those load factors with bigger aircraft but with much lower fares. And certainly, one of the reasons why our unit costs has been so good at the moment is taking up those load factors and has a significant impact on unit costs. In EU261, I mean, the latest kind of decisions are more of the same trend, where you\'re getting really some crazy court rulings that now makes the airlines responsible for tech. Apparently now, we\'re supposed to know when aircraft will go wrong, which, of course, if we knew they were going to wrong, we\'d fix them, they wouldn\'t go wrong. But I think it\'s really around the edges. It\'s another area of competitive advantage for Ryanair. We have better punctuality than every other airline in Europe. We have a higher rate of technical reliability, we have fewer cancellations and fewer delays. So whereas there, those could be some costs, it would be far less for Ryanair than for any of our other competitors. A question over here? Damian Brewer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division Damian Brewer from RBC. Two questions, please. First of all, can you give us an update on where you are on sort of technology and Web-enabled selling in terms of what you were developing? And then secondly, whether there\'s anything that, that can translate into sort of further efficiencies on the cost base or just being able to leverage the business more, so not just on the revenue side but on the cost side as well. And then can you give us an update on where you are in Aer Lingus? Obviously, competing much harder against it with the frequencies, where does that leave you in terms of what you do with the stake in the business? Michael O\'Leary Okay. The Ryanair Labs development is moving along at some pace. We\'re seeing now almost biweekly updates or updated and improved versions of both the desktop, the website and the mobile app. Over the next 6 to 12 months, you\'ll see a number of other developments. We\'re looking at making the ryanair.com website not just the kind of the capital website -- not just a website for low prices but making it a much more one-stop travel opportunity. At the moment, we spend a lot of time improving the way we retail things, like airport transfers, the car hires. There\'s a new hotel partner coming online very shortly. But we\'re now looking at different developments over the next 12 months, where you\'ll see us put up, for example, the one I\'m particularly keen on is comparison pricing. So every time you\'re on our website on any of our routes, we\'ll put up the competitor prices, our low-fare competitor prices. Because we are spilling a lot of people going off into these price aggregators or the Skyscanners and the eDreams, looking at who\'s got the lowest fares. Well, come to our website straightaway, and we\'ll give you the same price comparisons, they\'ll sit down at the right-hand side while you\'re booking on. And as you change a data or a flight or a destination, the price comparison technology will change on the right-hand side. So we want to pull you on to our website, where you know you\'ve got the lowest fares. We\'ll confirm it every time by putting up all of the lower fares of our competitor airlines on that route, on that date, on that flight, and then expanding into other developments, like putting up TripAdvisor feature on the website, customer feedback, rate the flight, rate the destination, rate your hotel, rate the experience. So that we are -- more and more people, we know they have to come to Ryanair for the fare -- for the flight and the fare, so why don\'t we keep them on our website for all the other kind of services that are, heretofore, they would have gone to a different website for? So whether it\'s customer reviews, ratings, recommendations or price comparisons, keep them on our website. There\'s a whole series of innovations that Ryanair Labs, which we\'ve only just set up and the CTO is only there less than 4 weeks, are working on. And you\'ll see those rolled out over the next 12 months. I think what they will do is there\'ll be significant efficiencies in terms of we\'ll have to spend less money on marketing. As we\'ve done, there\'s been a big jump in marketing spend this year to kind of support the Always Getting Better program. So we\'ll have more people now registered with Ryanair, customizing their travel for them, sending them individually tailored offers. We\'ll know with big data, we\'ll know more about the profile of each individual customer. So I think there\'ll be a big significant savings for us in sales and marketing. There should be some upward spike in ancillary revenues. But other than that, there won\'t be any other significant efficiencies. On Aer Lingus, the U.K. appeal will be heard before the end of calendar [Technical Difficulty] Operator [Operator Instructions] Michael O\'Leary Months, maybe 18 or 24 months. In the meantime though, however, the Aer Lingus thing has kind of -- well, we\'ve gone beyond it now, like we originally wanted Aer Lingus because it was going to be the vehicle by which we would go into the primary airports and kind of outdo easyJet at the primarily airports. We\'re now going to do that as Ryanair. We won the price -- the kind of price war. Now we\'re using Ryanair to be the softer -- to soften the somewhat harsh image of Ryanair, go into the primary airports, and we will now do what we wanted to do in Aer Lingus, we\'ll now do it as Ryanair. Having said that, we\'ll continue to make those appeals. We still think -- I mean, we\'re still stuck in this area where we had the bizarre situation that the European Union has blocked the current offer on the basis that competition intensified between Ryanair and Aer Lingus over the previous 3 years. The Brits have then come along and said, "You have to settle [ph] down because competition lessened over the 3 years." But if the Brits are right, then the Europeans can\'t blocked us buying it. And if the Europeans are right, then the Brits can\'t get involved anyway. So it\'s a tiresome irritant but increasingly, it\'s become about as increasingly irrelevant. We\'ve now -- I think around on the back of the government\'s decision now to scrap the travel tax, we\'re expanding rapidly in Ireland. We\'re taking enormous amounts of market share away from Aer Lingus. Customers, as we flesh out the schedules on from Ireland to the U.K., be in Europe this winter, are increasingly switching to Ryanair for their travel needs. And I think Aer Lingus will continue to shrivel and really not go anywhere in a hurry. It just becomes one of that group of peripheral European airlines that don\'t have any significant future but will continue to exist as peripheral subscale carriers in Europe. Alexia? Alexia Dogani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division It\'s Alexia Dogani from Goldman Sachs. I have 3 questions as well. Just firstly on FY \'16 and sort of unit cost of fuel drivers, clearly this year, given the increase in capacity growth, you\'re going to have a flat unit cost of fuel position. Should we expect similar situation next year? And what are the moving parts? Then secondly, on your comments about the load factor, I mean, clearly you have delivered earlier than expected some of the improvements. Do you think there is scope to go beyond 90%? Or would you then say we prefer to take more of the market through price rather than volume? And then just finally, in the context of the lower oil fuel price now, I mean, do you see a bit of the economics of the 737 MAX change sort of unfavorably in the sense of the fuel savings slightly reduced? Any comments around that would be helpful. Michael O\'Leary Thanks, Alexia. So okay, on FY \'16, we\'re staying away from FY \'16. We\'re too early in the cycle to be getting into -- we haven\'t even done the budget for FY \'16 yet. However, absent anything that we haven\'t yet seen, such as some crazy EUROCONTROL price increase, we think it\'s reasonable to expect that x fuel unit costs will be reasonably flat as long as the sector length remains reasonably unchanged out into FY \'16. And any further than that, I wouldn\'t go. Load factor, as we build the load factor, I think over the next 2 years, up from 87% to 90%, there\'s no reason why we would stop at 90%. But I think the gains would be harder at that point in time. Because you\'re really now -- at 90%, you\'re full essentially on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Mondays, and you\'re trying to get up from 75% to 76% to 77% in Tuesdays and Wednesdays. But I think we would, certainly on the basis of our experience this year, err in favor of raising load factors rather than trying to raise yields. We continue to believe that the -- as we double in size in the next 10 years, the real upside for Ryanair is capitalizing on what is a huge price advantage over every other airline in the same way that Lidl and Aldi are doing such damage to Tescos and Sainsbury\'s and everybody else here. We wouldn\'t want to give that away. And there\'s a lot of unit cost advantages to bringing up the load factors. So on balance, we won\'t stop at 90%, but it would be harder to cross those kind of load factor gains. Lower oil prices, yes, it may around the edges have lessened the effect. But I think there\'s no doubt when fuel is our biggest cost and we have an aircraft here that has 4% more revenue opportunity, 4% more seats and an 18% lower per seat fuel savings, almost regardless of what the fuel price is, it\'s a huge unit cost advantage for us in 5 years\' time that nobody else will have. And I think again it just begins -- you build, began to establish not just a huge price leadership over every other airlines but a widening unit cost gap between us and other airlines. I don\'t worry too much about the short-term fluctuations in fuel. I mean, one of the downsides, for example, of the declining spot price in fuel is some of the flakier, loss-making competitors, like Norwegian and Wales and those guys, who are on hedge because they don\'t have a balance sheet to be able to hedge, will probably do a little bit better in the short term. Frankly, I don\'t think it makes any difference. We have the cost discipline. We certainly have enormous momentum in the business model. And I think that one of the great things about having these Damascene conversions is there\'s an enormous appetite out there across Europe for the Ryanair Damascene conversion. So the more I talk about having this enlightening moment last year in changing and realizing that everything I\'ve done all my life was all wrong and yada, yada, yada, you get enormous acreage of free publicity about the Ryanair change and Ryanair is now being nice to the customers, yada, yada, yada. That on BBC this morning, all they want to talk about is some stupid survey at the weekend of 18,000 who says Ryanair is the second-worst brand in the world and [indiscernible]. Long may we continue to be so while the traffic grows by 9% and the profits jump 45%. So in some cases, pandering to whatever it is the impression out there works. But having said that, we are committed to improving the current customer experience and we\'re not there yet. We still have another year, 2 years of improvements to go. Neil Glynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division Neil from Crédit Suisse. Just one question on how you deploy your fleet through the winter. You\'ve obviously made the decision, I think you\'re grounding on these 50 this winter? Michael O\'Leary Yes. Neil Glynn - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division It\'s not that long ago where you operated a full fleet or thereabouts in the winter, I think maybe 4 years ago. And as you progress, as you make the business less seasonal, do you think could we ever get back to you operating in nearly full fleet in the winter? David O\'Brien Such as there\'s inevitably -- the question is there are different amounts in the summer to the winter. And as we grow frequencies to even higher levels, the trick would be to have frequencies in the winter. And into the shoulders, it\'s sufficiently high level to be able to drop some of them to cater for the summer growth. That\'s the conundrum that would take a number of years to address because you need to have capacity that is exclusively directed towards summer products and flying on ski routes every Saturday is not a balancing thing. So as we increase frequencies on primarily routes, that creates then the capacity for the summer and balances it, if that makes sense. Michael O\'Leary Can we just take some phone questions now if you don\'t mind, please? Just run them through. Operator We have 5 questions on the phone so far. The first is from Donal O\'Neill of Redburn. Donal O\'Neill - Redburn Partners LLP, Research Division It\'s Donal O\'Neill from Redburn. A couple of questions, please, guys. First one, just in terms of the growth you\'re expecting in the second half of the year. You\'ve kind of touched a little bit on market share. But what proportion of the growth is 16% in the second half do you think will come from market share gains versus from sort of underlying demand or prices-stimulated demand, given what you\'re trying to do on fares? The second question for the change in guidance for second half cost from plus 4% to flat are actually unit costs. Is all of that down to load factor? Or is there a portion of that, that has a change in the underlying cost base? And what that might be? And lastly, on kind of a more of forward-looking question, the net cash balance is pretty strong in the first half and obviously is going to be positive again in the second half. And if we were to take a sort of a flat assumption for FY \'16 versus FY \'15, it\'s going to be even greater in net cash the year after. Have you thought about what you might do with the balance sheet for FY \'16? Michael O\'Leary Okay. Thanks, Donal. I\'ll take the first of that. Neil will do the guidance and units costs, then I\'ll do 1 and 3. On the second half growth, I mean, in essence, nearly all of it will come from market share gains. While some of these are new markets for us, as we go into Glasgow-London, Edinburgh-London here, it\'s inevitable that we will take significant market share off easyJet and British Airways, partly because we have much lower fares but also because we have better times and a much better punctuality. Same thing, for example, in the market in Portugal, we\'re going double daily from Porto to Lisbon. Italy, we\'re taking -- but in Italy, we\'re not just taking market share, Alitalia is ceding the market share, too, as is Air Berlin in Germany. So while all of this will be new growth for us, most will come at the expense of market share gains. And I think we\'ll take significant -- we\'re already taking significant market share off Aer Lingus on the Dublin-U.K. [indiscernible] routes. But also this winter, we\'re going double dailies from Dublin, for example, to the main European capitals of Madrid, Barcelona, Rome, Milan, whereas Aer Lingus only do single dailies. I think we will take all of that significant market share off them, particularly for business passengers who want to go out and back on the same day. In terms of the net cash balances, yes, they\'re writing strongly. But remember, we\'re entering into a period of significant CapEx growth here for the next 2 or 3 years, where we\'re ramping up a lot of aircraft orders. We will probably pay more. I mean, we\'ll probably spend more of our own cash on those aircraft deliveries going forward than we did in the past. But if trading continues as it to be -- if we continue in line with guidance, the cash generation will continue to be strong. And as we have previously said in the past, we will revisit it on an annual basis. I think the special dividend will be paid in February. As long as we have some confidence into FY \'16 that we\'ll look then at another -- a share buyback program. Because I think on balance, we should be doing every second year, a special dividend and share buyback. So certainly, the board has already disclosed the possibility of another share buyback into calendar 2015 once we\'ve paid out the special dividends. So I think, yes, we will continue to look at rewarding the shareholders -- we returned EUR 2.5 billion to shareholders in the last 6 years through special dividends and share buybacks. And we expect to continue that program. Neil, do you want to comment on the... Neil Sorahan Yes. On the H2 cost guidance, we\'ve added an extra 2 million passengers into the mix. We\'ve gone from 87 million to 89 million passengers for the full year. And this is the primary reason why we\'ve been able to drop the unit cost savings down from plus 4% to flat. With fuel included, we\'re expecting 9% unit cost reductions on fuel this year. So when fuel is taken into the mix, we have a 4% unit cost reduction on total cost. Operator Our next question comes from Robin Byde of Cantor Fitzgerald. Robin Byde - Cantor Fitzgerald Europe, Research Division Just 2 for me, please. Firstly, just on refinancing. Obviously, you\'ve very successfully just issued your first bond. So do you have any further refi needs in the next 12 months? And then just secondly on CapEx, just as sort of follow-on to the earlier question, can you just update us on your expected gross outflows in FY \'16 and \'17? Is that still about EUR 1 billion each year? And do you expect to see any significant inflows from disposals? Neil Sorahan Okay. Robin, just on the CapEx first, we haven\'t changed our guidance on that. It\'s still EUR 1 billion a year for the next 2 years. The predelivery payments on the MAX deal don\'t really kick in after about \'17 onwards. On refinancing, we had a very successful bond issuance earlier on this year. We\'re at BBB+ rating, the most highly rated airline in the world. It\'s something that we will be looking at again. We have a EUR 3 billion EMTN program in place. We\'ve drawn down EUR 850 million of that and we can refresh it at anytime we want. We will continue to pay PDPs out of cash. And some of our CapEx next year will be debt-financed then. At the moment, the unsecured eurobond market looks attractive. Michael O\'Leary It\'s likely that we\'ll raise another eurobond -- I mean, another issuance some time before the end of FY \'16. Operator Our next question comes from Mark Simpson of Goodbody. Mark A. Simpson - Goodbody Stockbrokers, Research Division Just 2 questions. One, just wanted to touch on the business traffic again. You\'re talking about mid-single digit in terms of penetration in the winter months. That kind of suggests that you\'re looking at over 9,000 travelers a day on that Business Plus. Just wondering if you can give us a kind of number or numbers in terms of steady sales. And then the second side is you\'ve mentioned in a sense some of the response by competitors, where you are being more aggressive. I wonder if you could tell us a bit more about whether you see airlines retreating or whether you see them trying to match your prices. But given the widening cost gap, obviously that\'s going to be a significant cost not sustainable from those competitors. So I\'m wondering if you could just give us a bit more picture about how you see them responding to your current program. Michael O\'Leary Thanks, Mark. The figures you quote on the business traffic, there are days when we are selling those kind of numbers. But I really don\'t want to get any -- or lock us into any kind of number or forecast on the uptake of Business Plus. It\'s a product that I think would be a slow build, particularly in primary airports, where at the moment, many of the primary airports haven\'t even flown with Ryanair before. I think what gives us confidence is that we have 25% of passengers traveling with us on business. The question is how many of those will convert? And I think 10% over a 2- or 3-year period is a reasonably ambitious objective. It\'s too early to say yet. I think what will be instructive is how it builds this winter, particularly on those routes where we do have business schedules, like double dailies out of Dublin to Europe, the 4 and 5 times dailies out of Dublin to the U.K. [indiscernible] and the Scotland-London route. Response by competitors, I mean, it\'s kind of hard for us at moment to notice much of the response by competitors. In general terms, we tend not to see much of a pricing response because most of them are pricing so much higher than we are and they\'re under cost pressure themselves either from their airports, the airports they\'re at or their unions. I think actually most of what we know at the moment is the extent to which there are significant capacity reductions coming through in Germany, in Italy, in Spain, in Portugal. And I think really we see more and more people taking out short-haul capacity as being the response. But it\'s a response more to their own kind of economic difficulties than necessarily response to our expansions. But we see very little aggressive pricing response from any of the airlines, whether it\'s Aer Lingus in Ireland, easyJet in the U.K., TAP in Portugal, Alitalia in Italy, because frankly none of them can compete with us on pricing anyway. David, do you want to add anything to that in terms of competitor response? David O\'Brien No, that\'s a reasonable summary. Operator Our next question comes from Savi Syth of Raymond James. Savanthi Syth - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division Just 2 very quick questions. One is would you be doing less subleasing over the summer now that you have your fleet going back or expect a similar amount? And then the second question is just on the primary airport costs, given your new plans, is there additional pressure there from a cost perspective? Michael O\'Leary We leased in this summer 7 aircraft just to kind of keep -- so that we have that kind of capacity during the summer because we\'re taking delivery of 15 aircraft in the remainder of the fiscal -- in the winter part of fiscal year. We want to have some of those routes up and running. Having parted out the summer \'16 schedule already, and we again released it 3 months earlier than we did last year so that we can maintain this positive momentum in forward bookings, already we thought it looks like we need to new lease in another 6 or 7 aircraft next summer. That\'s because we only take delivery of 20 aircraft from Boeing between now and the end of May -- the end of June next year. The following winter, winter \'15 and \'16, we take delivery of almost 40 aircraft. So for summer \'16, we won\'t need any lease-in aircraft. So I think what you\'ll see is as we lease in 7 in summer \'14, we\'ve got to need another 6 or 7 in summer \'15, and then nothing in summer \'16 because we have enough aircraft delivery to be able to handle it all ourselves. I think on primary airports, we have a mix there because undoubtedly, the primary airports tend to be more expensive than the average of our secondary airports. But as you can see in the cost analysis and the unit cost discipline, the key feature for us at the primary airports is one that we can secure 25-minute turnarounds and therefore, maintain our efficiency. There\'s no doubt that the cost or the opportunities at the primary airports are getting better as more and more primary airports compete with us to get our scarce capacity into summer \'15 and summer \'16. So we\'re getting real and material discounts at the primary airports. And to that, you have to balance the fact that we have a 10-year growth agreement at London Stansted, where we have very low-cost base for growth. You have a growth deal at Dublin Airport, allied to the Irish government scrapping the travel tax, which has been good for our cost out of Dublin. So we\'re able to mix-and-match some of the primary airport development with also declining cost in some of our existing primary airports as well as in some cases, [indiscernible] the very low-cost secondary airports. So if you look at the numbers for the quarter, yes, the cost of the airport -- the handling costs have risen at a slightly higher rate than passenger traffic volumes but nothing that we can\'t handle within an overall flat unit cost for the full year. Operator And the final question on the phone so far is from Anand Date of Deutsche Bank. Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Michael, I\'m just wondering if I could have your latest thoughts on maybe Ryanair holidays or the way your latest thinking is on maybe a frequent flyer program. That seems the one thing that is maybe missing that you\'ve been reluctant to do in the past. And also just out of curiosity, could you maybe go through some of the basic dynamics of a difference between domestic routes and international routes? So just what you kind of see versus each other in terms of loads, business versus the FI [ph] yields and whether given you\'re becoming fairly dominant on some markets for domestic, whether you\'ll return to potentially offering tie-ups with the legacy carriers there. Michael O\'Leary Yes. Thanks, Anand. The first 2 of those are very much part of the Ryanair Labs strategic and development program. I think we already carry a huge number of holidaymakers across Europe. I think it\'s inevitable that we will -- but it\'s over a medium-term rollout kind of holiday product, where you\'d be able to get all-inclusive holiday packages on the Ryanair website. But it\'s not high up on the agenda. It won\'t be in the next 12 months. It might be something over the next 2 or 3 years. Frequent flyer program, we won\'t have a frequent flyer program in the sense of the traditional frequent flyer program with plastic cards and accounts and points and all the rest of it. But for the passengers who register with us on the My Ryanair registration, we\'ll have -- big data will enable us to have a much more individualized or tailored frequent flyer program. So what I see us doing maybe as early as the end of calendar \'15 is those passengers, we\'ll be writing to passengers, thanking them for flying with us in 2015. Those who flew maybe 4 times than last year will get an incentive to fly more than 6 times in 2016. Those who flew 20 times within 2014 will get a thank you of a 50% off a flight in January and February 2015. So we\'ll have individual, tailored, I think, offers recognizing the volumes for each individual passenger and trying to incentivize each individual passenger rather than a big cumbersome FFD program that takes a lot of administration and everything else. We were able to do the analysis. The data mining we\'re doing now will enable us to have an individually designed kind of encourage more flying program with each individual passenger. David, do you want to comment on the domestic and international routes? David O\'Brien Sure. I mean, the key -- one of the key features of the domestic route is that it tends to be shorter and demand higher frequencies, which is useful in delivering on volume to airports, while at the same time, allowing you to have a highly efficient schedule by attaching a short domestic, let\'s say, first thing in the morning, to a longer international flight, solving the airport passenger volume problem and adding new routes. The negative with domestics is that they tend to be later bookings, so you don\'t see the future as early and they tend to attract lesser ancillaries. So on balance, they are a very positive development in terms of fleet utilization, traffic volumes and so on and sector length. Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division So Michael, is it possible could I ask a follow-up? Michael O\'Leary Yes. Anand Date - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division Just in terms of the big data, is there any other way you can monetize it as well? Because I\'m just kind of thinking if I look at Smiles, if I look at Multiplus, you\'ve probably got one of the few data sources that is growing and probably getting a deeper amount of data per passenger. Is there anything else you can do with the data as well in terms of third parties or anything like that? Michael O\'Leary I think there\'s lots of things we can do, but I think we need to be careful. Like we\'re not in the old days, we\'d simply run around and sold the data. I think what we want to do is to bring more and more people on to the ryanair.com website, more and more people to register. And I think there\'s a number of different things we\'re looking at under the Ryanair Labs banner, where we can exploit the data and use or monetize probably by attracting other partners to come and work with the ryanair.com website to provide other value to our passengers. We\'ll be able to give them very rich content, very detailed profiles off of an enormous passenger base. But that\'s really not for today. I\'m conscious of the fact that if we want to give kind of the whole Ryanair Labs development, I think it\'s something that we\'ll be doing -- detailing in much more detail when we get to the full year results roadshow next May. Are there any more questions in the room? Nothing more on the phone? So thanks, everybody, then for joining in today. I\'ll say we have extensive roadshows, there\'s 8 teams on the road covering all of the markets. If you haven\'t or you want a meeting with us through the week, please let us know either through Davy or at Citibank or through our own Investor Relations team and we\'ll pencil you in. Other than that, I look forward to meeting everybody hopefully on a one-to-one basis during the weekend. Thank you very much for dialing in and coming this morning. As I said, the business is progressing very well. Certainly, the more aggressive forward bookings and pricing is certainly finding favor among the customer base.The changes we\'ve made in the customer experience and the improvements, which I think is year 1 of a 3-year program, is certainly being welcomed by our passengers. I think we have a lock on, but there\'s still much more to be done over the next 2 or 3 years. And can I please again caution the analysts, don\'t be inventing numbers here. The figure won\'t be north of EUR 800 million for the current year. We\'ve done very well. We expect profits to grow by about 45%, but that will be enough for this year, I hope. And we\'re beginning to focus in on next year and how we roll out further improvements, and hopefully further profitability and share price gains. Thanks very much, everybody.
